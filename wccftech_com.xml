			<p>A port of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD on Nintendo Switch 2 is still a possibility, despite the original GameCube release being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/">Nintendo Switch Online library.</a></p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinda Funny Games</a> during last week's press event, which allowed media to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD could still be released on the new system, as all options are on the table. While the port hasn't been confirmed, it has been highlighted how games being available via the Nintendo Switch Online service hasn't prevented other versions of said games from being released on the original Switch, so there's still hope to see the remaster breaking free from the Wii U captivity it has been since its release.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, we have been hearing rumors of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD getting ported to Nintendo Switch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">quite some time</a>, but neither game has ever materialized, leaving fans no other option than playing the Wii U releases. While both games feature plenty of improvements over the original releases, Zelda: Wind Waker HD definitely sports the most significant changes, with plenty of gameplay improvements that make it, together with the enhanced visuals, the definitive way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series to date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> has received a new trailer for the Horde Assault mode ahead of the game's launch set for April 25. Kevin McAllister, Creative &amp; Product Lead at developer Bend Studio, also shared new information on Horde Assault in a dedicated <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/days-gone-remastered-a-closer-look-at-the-horde-assault-modes-survival-arcade-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The 'survival arcade' mode was designed to challenge the players' skills as they attempt to beat their high score while surviving as long as possible against increasing horde sizes and various enemies such as Breakers, Reachers, and Raging Bears. In Horde Assault, players start with only a sidearm and must fight their way through the initial Freaker onslaught to reach Deacon St. John's Drifter Bike, an invaluable tool for traversing the open region.</p>
<p>Raiding the supply crates scattered across the map is crucial to increasing your chances of survival. There are more than 20 weapons available, including a new flamethrower not available in Story mode. The weapons that drop from each crate are random and reset each time you start a new game.</p>
<p>You may also replenish your supplies and earn extra XP by completing side quests. Also, if you manage to survive 30 minutes on any map, you will be treated to the Ultimate Horde, a never-ending horde battle that will relentlessly hunt you down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Days Gone Remastered - Horde Assault Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BJ5L-TIK1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As players level up Deacon St. John, they can earn in-mode rewards with never-before-playable characters, new patch cosmetics, and unique Injectors. Speaking of those, Days Gone players will already be familiar with the benefits of Injectors from the main story. This idea carries over to Horde Assault, but now with a big boost to drastically change gameplay in the form of modifiers. Throughout your journey to Legendary Survivor, you can earn a total of 24 unique Injectors - 12 positive and 12 negative. Positive Injectors provide a positive boost to your score but increase the challenge. Negative Injectors will penalize your score but increase your chance of survival with gameplay benefits.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploding Freakers – Upon death, Freakers will explode. You need any advantage you can get when facing increased horde sizes, and this Injector is a unique way to trim its numbers.</li>
<li>Wanted – Start at maximum heat level. In Horde Assault, the longer you survive, the more difficult your chances of survival become. With this Injector, that escalation difficulty system begins immediately, proving to be a real challenge that only the strongest will survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Days Gone Remastered, as players go through Horde Assault mode, they'll progress through a Reward path of 35 levels. Each level earns them a reward, such as Injectors, character skins, and patch cosmetics, and six never-before-playable additional characters from Days Gone: O’Brian, Lisa, fan-favorite Skizzo, and more.</p>
<p>On PlayStation 5, this new edition of the game also comes with graphical enhancements, full DualSense support, new accessibility features and enhanced Photo Mode. PlayStation 4 and PC owners of the base game can purchase the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238470/Days_Gone__Broken_Road_DLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Road DLC</a> for $10, accessing Horde Assault as well as Permadeath mode and Speedrun mode.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/days-gone-drifting-through-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loved</a> Days Gone at launch. Unfortunately, a pitch for a sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a>. In theory, a movie should be in production, although there haven't been any official updates on that front <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-film-adaptation-on-the-way-game-creators-arent-happy-with-cast-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since August 2022</a>. Meanwhile, Bend Studio had its next project, an open world multiplayer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> a couple of months ago.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-from-nintendo-wont-require-any-download/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-from-nintendo-won%E2%80%99t-require-any-download.1160127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-from-nintendo-wont-require-any-download/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When buying Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games at retail, customers won't need any further downloads, at least if the games have been published by Nintendo. The same may not necessarily be true for third-party publishers, though. The lingering question was finally answered by a company spokesperson in a statement <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Vooks.net</a>:</p>
<p><em>The physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e., they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</em></p>
<p>So far, the following games will allow customers to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (currently unknown price)</li>
<li>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 + Star-Crossed World ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma (third-party; $69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A (currently unknown price)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as many had assumed, Nintendo also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will not include that game's Expansion Pass. Following the launch, Nintendo released two DLCs: The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. It is presently unclear, although likely, if players will be able to purchase them separately on the new console.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of fantastic sights and sounds to take in on Hazel's journey to the small town of Prospero. But there's also plenty to read as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> shines brightest with its storytelling, and that includes all the little notes you can find along your journey. Each of them adds a bit of context to the events you're experiencing and learning about.</p>
<p>They can also add a welcomed dose of historical context at times, digging into some of the tragedies that people in this fictional town faced that pull from real-life horrors. That's why it's well worth your time to seek out all 103 notes you can read in South of Midnight.</p>
<p>Starting with Chapter 1, we'll take you through where to find every single note.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 1</h2>
<p>There are only 3 notes to find in the first chapter of the game, and they're all in Bunny's house. So don't worry about looking around for anything until Hazel wakes up in Bunny's house after the night of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's note to Lily on tea</strong> - You can find this note in the room where Hazel wakes up. Look to your right, where you'll see a desk and a mirror. On that desk is the first note and the first layer of Bunny's character beginning to unravel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Notes-Guides-Chapter-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1982&nbsp;</strong>- This note and the next are both in the same room, Bunny's office. You'll climb into this room by climbing the ledges around the house, and you'll find this note on the desk to your left when you enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1989 &amp; 2003</strong> - You'll find these two journal entries as one note on the red chair, immediately in front of you when you enter Bunny's office.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>And that's all the notes for Chapter 1 in South of Midnight. Only 100 more to go!</p>
