			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may get a new story DLC early next year from the studio that's working on the remake of the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1l9gnje/new_witcher_3_dlc_may_be_coming_in_2026_before/">PC Gaming subreddit,</a>&nbsp;well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed during a recent podcast hosted by Remigiusz Maciaszek that the third entry in the series by CD Projekt Red may get an additional story DLC that is being developed by Fool's Theory, the studio that is working on the remake of the first entry in the series, early next year. According to the commentator, this could be the unspecified project from the studio that was mentioned during one of CDPR's earnings calls. Unfortunately, no other information is currently available on this potential story DLC, so it could be a single additional questline, similar to that released for free to celebrate the launch of the horrendous, in my humble opinion, Netflix show, or a longer, paid expansion.</p>

<p>Even if The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt won't get any more content from CDPR, some amazing modding projects in the works will allow players to return to the Continent to experience more stories, or to play through some of the most important events in the life of Geralt of Rivia, before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a>. Among these projects is The Last Wish project, which aims to recreate the book written by Andrzej Sapkowski that includes some fantastic stories, such as the titular The Last Wish. The project's alpha is now available for <a href="https://www.thelastwishproject.com/">download</a>, allowing players to experience the first video game adaptation of The Lesser Evil story and learn why Geralt is called The Butcher of Blaviken. You can check out the alpha before downloading in the video put together by xLetalis.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-an-oled-screen.1216272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Microsoft and ASUS finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> their joint Xbox handheld projects: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. However, neither of the handhelds is equipped with an OLED screen, much to the chagrin of those who'd love the infinite contrast provided by the cutting-edge displays.</p>
<p>Why, though? Well, ASUS Senior Manager of Marketing Content for Gaming Whitson Gordon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1TYbHggfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that clearly in a recent stream: essentially, it has to do with drawing more power when coupled with variable refresh rate, a tradeoff the company wasn't willing to make.</p>
<p><em>We've gone hard on OLED with our desktop monitors. It is no secret that we love OLED at ROG, right? But on the Ally, the calculus is different. We talked about this in more detail last year in our Q&amp;A and so I won't go quite as deep today, but we're in a similar boat. We did look at OLED again this year. We did some R&amp;D and prototyping with OLED, but it's still not where we want it to be when you factor VRR into the mix and we aren't willing to give up VRR. I'll draw that line in the sand right now. I am of the opinion that if a display doesn't have variable refresh rate, it's not a gaming display in the year 2025 as far as I'm concerned, right? That's a must-have feature, and OLED with VRR right now draws significantly more power than the LCD that we're currently using on the Ally and it costs more.</em></p>
<p><em>When we look at what people are buying in the handheld market right now, both in terms of the sales of our devices and what we see from competitors, it's pretty clear what price bands people are willing to buy a device like this in, because remember, it's a secondary device for a lot of people. It's not their primary device. I see a lot of people in feedback saying that they want this exact thing. They say, "I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for this." Well, yeah, we don't want that</em><br>
<em>either. That's why we're trying to avoid having it cost an arm and a leg by not putting things in that the vast majority of users don't need. We're trying to hit a reasonable price point on these.</em></p>
<p><em>That's all I'll say about price. You have to align your expectations with the market and what we're doing here. Adding 32GB, OLED, Z2 Extreme, and all of those extra bells and whistles would cost a lot more than the price bracket you guys are used to on the Ally, and the vast majority of users are not willing to pay that kind of price.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to specifications, the display is identical between the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X: a 7-inch FullHD IPS screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync Premium. However, the ROG Xbox Ally X has more storage (1TB versus 512GB), more RAM (24 vs 16GB), a more powerful processor (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-apu-next-gen-handhelds-16-rdna-3-5-gpu-8-zen-5-cpu-cores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryzen Z2 Extreme</a> vs the Ryzen Z2), and the impulse triggers for controls. The pricing of each model hasn't been revealed yet, but we do know that ASUS is planning to launch both handhelds this holiday, so more details are forthcoming.</p>

			<p>A couple of days ago, Epic Games <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/58476593/Epic_Games,_Inc_v_Atas_aka_Sincey_Cheats_and_Vanta_Cheats_et_al" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina against Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey Cheats and Vanta Cheats, a maker of Fortnite cheats.</p>
<p>Epic Games alleges that Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey and Vanta Cheats, has made money from developing and selling cheat software for Fortnite since at least January 2023. According to the firm, the software gives players an unfair advantage over those who don't cheat and is therefore in violation of its EULA due to its circumvention of Fortnite's anti-cheat software. Epic also claims widespread cheating could put legitimate players off, potentially translating into a loss of sales of season passes and cosmetics. In its lawsuit, Epic said it was forced to ban tens of thousands of Fortnite accounts using Sincey Cheats software, including over 15K bans against accounts in the United States alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that, after Epic Games submitted DMCA takedown notices to YouTube to remove videos featuring the offending cheating software, Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent, impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to “formally reverse its claim of copyright infringement” by spoofing Epic Games email addresses. You can see an example <a href="https://x.com/SinceyCheats/status/1872973112892928458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targets five unnamed defendants who have been reselling Sincey Cheats's software through various channels. Predictably, Epic Games is seeking compensatory and statutory damages, as well as covering attorney costs and other lawsuit-related costs.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a game developer has sued a cheat maker. Bungie did it a few times recently against Destiny 2 cheat makers and even won against both <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-cheat-seller-lavicheats-is-hit-by-6-7m-lawsuit-from-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaviCheats</a> (getting a multi-million dollar compensation) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AimJunkies</a>. Whether that will be enough to discourage cheat makers remains to be seen.</p>
