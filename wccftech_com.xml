			<p>Paul Walter Hauser, an actor who you probably know from the Apple TV+ series Black Bird, has joined Zach Creggar's upcoming Resident Evil movie, according to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/paul-walter-hauser-austin-abrams-resident-evil-zach-cregger-1236546153/">Deadline</a>. Creggar co-wrote the film with John Wick writer Shay Hatten, and he'll also be directing it following his critical hit from this year, Weapons.</p>



<p>Hauser is the second actor to publicly join the project, after Wolfs actor Austin Abrams was reported to be taking part in the <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-austin-abrams-zach-cregger-1236346563/">film earlier this year.</a> The new movie is due to arrive on September 18, 2026, though at the time of this writing we don't have a strong idea as to what the plot of the film will be, or who else will be joining Hauser and Abrams in the cast.</p>



<p>What we do know about the story, according to what Creggar told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/zach-cregger-interview-resident-evil-weapons">Inverse</a> in an interview, is that is won't be a Leon Kennedy-based story. Creggar is looking to tell "<em>a different story</em>" compared to the games, but doesn't want fans to be concerned that his film won't be a Resident Evil story.</p>



<p>"<em>It is obedient to the lore of the games, it’s just a different story</em>. <em>I’m not going to tell Leon’s story, because Leon’s story is told in the games. [Fans] already have that.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Let me say this: this is not breaking the rules of the games</em>. <em>I am the biggest worshiper of the games, so I’m telling a story that is a love letter to the games and follows the rules of the games.</em>"</p>



<p>In other Resident Evil news, ahead of Creggar's film, fans of the series can look forward to Resident Evil Requiem arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">February 27, 2026</a>.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Paradox Interactive admitted its original mistake and announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will include all playable vampire clans in the base version. At Gamescom 2025, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Toreador and Lasombra clans would only be available as part of the Premium Edition or, separately, through a $21.99 DLC. Needless to say, this caused a massive backlash from fans, eventually forcing Paradox to rework the plan.</p>



<p>Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing. We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.</em></p>

<p>Now, the Premium Edition will include, in addition to the already announced Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack that hearkens back to the original game, two upcoming story DLCs. The first, titled Loose Cannon, follows Brujah Sheriff Benny's brutal perspective, letting players experience his story of relentless pursuit. When Loose Cannon launches, players with the Premium Edition will also unlock a Benny-inspired outfit for Phyre. Loose Cannon launches in Q2 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The second DLC is called The Flower &amp; the Flame and follows Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s legendary path to creating her dark magnum opus. Players who own The Flower &amp; the Flame will also get a Ysabella-inspired outfit for Phyre when the story pack launches. The Flower &amp; the Flame launches in Q3 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The Expansion Pass can be purchased separately on October 21, 2025, for $34.99/£28.99/€34.99.</p>

<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will also offer a physical Premium Edition priced at $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Created with PLAION, it will include the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox pre-order bonus, the Expansion Pass, five character cards, a journal, and a Steelbook case, all packaged in a premium box.</p>
