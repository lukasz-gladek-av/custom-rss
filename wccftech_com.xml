			<p>Finally, after weeks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">leaks</a> and even official <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">screenshots appearing online</a>, Bethesda has not only officially acknowledged The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake but also announced that we'll get a full reveal and showcase of the game tomorrow, <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, at <strong>8 am PT / 11 am ET / 4 pm BT.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>A short <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">post</a> from the studio's official X account tells us when we'll learn more about the long-awaited remake and where to check it out, with the 'where' being either the Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> channels.</p>
<p>The title of the video on Bethesda's YouTube channel says "<em>All will be revealed...,</em>" hopefully implying that we'll not only learn about what has gone into the remake, the new features available, and the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release date could very well be tomorrow, shortly after the reveal. Rumors about the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remake already had their sights set on today, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">sometime</a> in the back half of April, for the game's release.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we know that those rumors claiming an April 21 release had their wires crossed with today's announcement that the reveal would be tomorrow. But now we can expect to play Oblivion on at least Xbox consoles and PCs before the week is out. It's still up in the air whether it'll be available on PS5 right away or if Xbox players will enjoy a short period of exclusivity for the remake before it comes to PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/renting-a-ps5-is-increasingly-popular-in-japan-with-retailers-selling-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While people are still buying plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/">PS5 consoles</a>, renting a PS5 is becoming an increasingly popular option for players in Japan. A new report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/20/news070_4.html">IT Media News</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/renting-ps5s-proving-extremely-popular-in-japan-with-most-stores-selling-out/">VGC</a>) shows that retail stores in Japan where you can rent a PS5 are selling out of consoles to rent.</p>
<p>You can rent a PS5 in multiple regions worldwide, with the cost of renting a PS5 for either 8 days or 15 days at a time in Japan coming in at ¥980 ($6.62 USD) or ¥1,780 ($12.02 USD), respectively. The service only became available in Japan at the top of the year as a response to the console not being as readily available in the region.</p>
<p>A Japanese retailer, GEO, told IT Media news that the service is "<em>more popular than they expected</em>" and that the majority of its 400 stores are "<em>at capacity</em>" with the consoles available to rent. GEO cites the release of Monster Hunter Wilds as a likely reason why the service has, of late, become extremely popular.</p>
<p>Considering the cost, it's a very low barrier to entry if all you want to do is try a console and a new game before making a bigger investment to buy the whole console and a brand-new game. Other retailers around the world, like Raylo in the UK, allow players to rent a PS5 for much longer periods of time. With the popularity of the service in Japan, it wouldn't be surprising if longer rental periods start to be introduced.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that buying a PS5 to own has only gone up in price since it launched in 2020, rather than down, as the case has been in every previous console generation. If you are someone who wants a PS5 but has been unable to buy one for the last five years, it's no surprise that you would jump at the chance to take one home for a couple of weeks for about $12 instead of buying it for hundreds.</p>
<p>At least then you'd be able to satisfy your curiosity to some degree. It'll also be interesting to see if Sony responds by focusing on making more consoles available in Japan.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> cracked the top 10 list of the most-played games in the US during its launch week, according to Circana's executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnd7qpxrns27">reported</a> the list of the top 15 games in terms of player engagement for the week of April 12, 2025, which is the week that South of Midnight officially launched. The top 10, even top 15 games regarding player engagement, are usually a very predictable list.</p>
<p>Just think of the most popular live service titles; you'll see most of them on the list. So, for a brand-new single-player game, not based on any existing series, to crack the top 10 is a strong showing.</p>
<p>It didn't crack the top sales list, but with South of Midnight launching into Xbox Game Pass, player engagement was always going to be the more important metric to look at. For Compulsion Games, it's great that so many players were willing to take a chance on South of Midnight and check it out.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto V, EA Sports College Football 25, NBA 2K25 and Rainbow Six Siege. All of them are major live service titles you'll commonly see on lists tracking player engagement.</p>
<p>Of the top 15, the only other single-player game included is Assassin's Creed: Shadows, which came in at number 11, while South of Midnight eked into the top 10 at number 9.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Xbox responds now, because Hi-Fi Rush also launched with strong engagement and positive responses from players and critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">Tango Gameworks</a> was still shuttered by Xbox before being brought back to life by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/">Krafton</a>. Hopefully, Compulsion will continue to get strong support from Xbox instead of suffering the same fate as Tango.</p>
