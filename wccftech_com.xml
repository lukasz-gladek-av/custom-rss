			<p>Back in my day, branded storage solutions were lucky to have more than a small decal slapped onto the side of it. Even my Outsiders-themed external drive that powered my PlayStation 5's extra storage was little more than a silk-screened logo atop one of Western Digital's WD_Black P10 drive. For many gamers, picking a themed hard drive to match the aesthetic of their setup, or merely support their favorite character or franchise, meant sacrificing performance for style. Seagate has proven this wrong with their numerous Limited Edition HDD and SSDs to date. Their latest release is a special collaboration with mihoYo for Genshin Impact, which Seagate sent me to try out for an unboxing and to take on the road to GDC next week.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, we're unboxing the latest in Seagate's line of Limited Edition Gaming SSD's based on one of Genshin Impact's earliest Electro Units: Cyno. This pocket-sized 1TB external drive is smaller than your average deck of playing cards. Coming in at just under 100x50x11mm, this&nbsp; drive was a no-brainer to throw into my everyday carry for when I need to capture some footage or snag a recording off a capture station.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The bright purple styling representing Cyno immediately stands out among the packages of other drives and headsets on my office wall, but no one buys a hard drive just to leave it sealed in box. Inside the package are just enough goodies to take this drive for a spin and immediately start storing your favorite content on-the-go. All around the unit are some runic designs, with a logo on the underside not quite the usual icon you'd see for Cyno in game but recognizable enough by the Anubis motif. Similar to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/seagate-releases-starfield-xbox-game-drive-but-your-xbox-series-wont-play-the-game-from-it/">Starfield</a> line of Seagate's Limited Edition drives, there is a full LED ring around the bottom of the drive, although this particular model only comes with a simple purple colorway. A small status LED also pokes out through the short edge of the drive opposite the USB Type-C 3.2 port.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>With only a 65 gram weight, this Genshin Impact-themed drive can easily fit in a knapsack without even noticing it's there. Thumb drives used to be my transfer method of choice when it comes to snagging screenshots and video footage off my PlayStation 5 for reviews, but now that external SSD's like these have become more readily available and lightweight, I've reformed my ways. Seagate claims that the drive comes with both a three-year warranty and three years of their Rescue Data Recovery Services, so if one of my transfers does wind up going back, at least there's a chance to recover it.</p>

<p>The Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition SSD is truly a limited affair, being limited exclusively to their <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/">online webstore</a> at $139.99. While the price comes in higher than most of their other themed drives, this one is a unique bit of kit that I could see Genshin Impact fans picking up for more Cyno merch representation in their homes.</p>

			<p>Obsidian Entertainment has <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new update for its action roleplaying game Avowed. Version 1.3 brings several community requested improvements, such as providing an extra talent point for the main character at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Players who have already leveled up to the max won't have to worry, as their characters will also retroactively receive the extra talent points.&nbsp; While playing the game, I did have the feeling that the game was a bit stingy with talents. This will definitely help with build creation.</p>
<p>Obsidian also introduced several quality of life improvements with this Avowed patch:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new option to increase font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab in an effort to improve readability</li>
<li>Improved customization for the HUD (Heads-Up Display), including a new keybind (set to backslash by default) that hides all interface elements to help with screenshot captures and an opacity slider</li>
<li>A new FOV (Field of View) slider for third-person camera</li>
<li>A static compass option that always points to the north instead of rotating</li>
<li>Full support to customize controller keybinds</li>
<li>A toggle between walking and running for mouse and keyboard users</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also several balance tweaks, bug fixes, and minor performance improvements, too.</p>
<p>So far, Avowed has <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly done well enough</a> to satisfy Obsidian and Microsoft. It rightfully should. While perhaps not quite a masterpiece, it comes close, as I explained in my review:</p>
<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>
<p>Will there be a sequel? It's too early to say. Game Director Carrie Patel shared her enthusiasm to do more with the team now that they had found their groove. However, in a more recent interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Eurogamer</a>, she seemed a bit more tentative, hinting that there may be a new IP in the cards for the studio, too.</p>
<p><em>The wonderful thing about the reception Avowed has gotten is it shows that there is certainly an appetite for new fantasy IPs. I recognise that some of our players are coming from Pillars and Deadfire, but I think for the majority of people, this is their first time in the world of Eora, so it's heartening to see that there is appetite for that novelty, that players are interested in jumping into something new. It certainly gives us a lot of enthusiasm and optimism for continuing to be ambitious, continuing to introduce players to new worlds, and bringing them into the games we're making and the things that are exciting to us. I know we're always excited to try new things.</em></p>
<p>Should Obsidian make a sequel to Avowed or something else entirely after they're done with The Outer Worlds 2? Let us know your opinion below.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's Silent Hill Transmission developer stream</a>, KONAMI shared a new trailer and many details about the upcoming horror game Silent Hill f. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and the spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a>, it features an original story set in 1960s Japan, more specifically in a remote mountain town called Ebisugaoka.</p>
<p>Here, teenager Shimizu Hinako has led a fairly unremarkable life, until a thick fog descends, transforming her home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles and battle terrifying entities to survive. Faced with impossible choices, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, and face the horrors that await within the mist.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, which previously worked as a developer partner on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Marvel's Avengers, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This will be their first high-profile game as a lead developer.&nbsp;The producer is Motoi Okamoto, who has already worked on the highly successful Silent Hill 2 remake, while the writer is Ryukishi07, renowned for Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry. On the developer stream, he said:</p>
<p><em>To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It's an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I've poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don't think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.</em></p>
<p><em>To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it's a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person's heart and mind. It's my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you'll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.</em></p>

<p>Ryukishi07 is not the only famed artist involved with the creation of Silent Hill f. Illustrator and monster designer kera is working on the game's artistic style, while legendary series composer Akira Yamaoka returns to compose the music for the game's Fog World. He's splitting work with fellow composer Kensuke Inage (Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, Tekken 8), who's composing the music for the game's Otherworld.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with no announced release date. However, the game's Steam page already includes the minimum and recommended PC requirements.</p>
