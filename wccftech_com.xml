			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>'s engine was updated with features lifted from later versions of the engine to enable PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features like PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution support.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, Ninja Theory's Technical Director Gavin Costello goes over the work that went into porting the second entry in the series to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, saying that the process was more about porting the technology than the game specifically. Taking advantage of the very good platform integration Epic has in place, the team had no trouble getting the game running and fully playable from beginning to end on Sony's consoles and getting an overview of where the game's performance was. From this point, the developer implemented every feature of the game into the new versions of the game, and also updated the older version of Unreal Engine 5 the game shipped on with new features taken from newer version of the engine to enable some PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features, like PSSR and variable rate shading. Considering the launch of the PlayStation 5 version of the game will coincide with the release of a new update for the Xbox Series version which introduces a 60 FPS performance mode on Xbox Series X, it is likely these new features have allowed the implementation of 60 FPS gameplay into this version of the game.</p>

<p>Introducing a Performance Mode on Xbox Series X is only <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/">one of the new features</a> that will hit Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II with tomorrow's update. On PC, this new version of the game will introduce a Very High preset that pushes visual fidelity further, as well as Steam Deck verification featuring optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the system. The update will also introduce a new play mode and other improvements.</p>



<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The PlayStation 5 port, as well as the Enhanced update, will launch tomorrow, August 12.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Making a Far Cry TV Series with FX]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the recently confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed live-action TV series at Netflix</a>, Ubisoft has confirmed that it has another adaptation of one of its franchises in the works. This time, it's in collaboration with FX, and it's a TV series adaptation of the Far Cry franchise.</p>



<p>But this announcement isn't like the Assassin's Creed one, because it wasn't supposed to be live. Ubisoft let the news slip on its website before quickly redacting and redirecting the page, though not quickly enough that it wasn't shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a> and caught by the rest of the internet.</p>



<p>The details of the series which remain on Reddit reveal that the series is set to be an anthology, where "<em>each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding the talent behind the series, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star and co-creator Rob Mac <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rob-mcelhenney-legally-change-name-rob-mac-1236443403/">(formerly known as Rob McElhenney)</a> and Noah Hawley, the creator and writer behind FX's Fargo series and more recently its soon-to-debut at the time of this writing Alien: Earth series are leading the charge on FX's take on the world of Far Cry.</p>



<p>Mac is set to star in the Far Cry series, at least for the first season, presumably, while Hawley will take showrunning duties. Mac will also be an executive producer alongside Hawley, Jackie Cohn of More Better Productions, Michael Garcia of 26Keys Productions, and Nick Frenkel of 3Arts Entertainment. For Ubisoft's part, Gerad Guillemot, Margret Boykin, and Austin Dill are alongside as executive producers from Ubisoft's film and television division. </p>



<p>Boykin, head of Ubisoft's film and television division, is quoted as saying "<em>This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling</em>."</p>



<p>Since it'll be an anthology series, there's no expectation that it'll try to follow in the footsteps of previous Far Cry games. It's more likely that the show will focus on telling its own stories, so maybe don't expect Vaas to show up or anything like that. That said, there's always the chance Mac and Hawley could do their own thing with the show while leaving a few Easter-eggs for fans of the games to pick up on. Hopefully, we'll know more about it soon, whenever Ubisoft decides to put the news back on its website.</p>
