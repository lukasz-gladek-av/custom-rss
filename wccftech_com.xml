			<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>
