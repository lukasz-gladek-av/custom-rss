			<p>Wolcen Studio has finally revealed the real title of its PvPvE extraction game, which, up until now, we've only known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolcen-studios-project-pantheon-will-host-its-second-closed-alpha-test-later-this-month/">Project Pantheon</a>. It's officially called Gods, Death, and Reapers, and we just got a new gameplay trailer showcased during the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>The isometric RPG is still fairly early in development, as there was no release date or even release window announced alongside the official title reveal, but it is available for you to try if you're interested. Just head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Gods_Death__Reapers/">Steam page</a> and request access for the closed playtest to jump in now.</p>

<p>"<em>Gamescom 2025 marks a huge milestone for us as we finally get to share&nbsp;</em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reaper</em>'s official name and gameplay with the world," said game director Andrei Chirculete in a press release. "<em></em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>&nbsp;is a game that started from one simple idea: what if you could play an extraction game that looks like a top-down ARPG? Now that this idea has turned into&nbsp;<em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>, we can't wait to hear from our players what they think, as it will help us shape up the best version throughout the coming Closed Alpha tests!"</p>



<p>To learn more about Project Pantheon, now Gods, Death, &amp; Reapers, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">check out our interview with Wolcen Studio from earlier this year</a>, after a conversation with the team at Gamescom 2024.</p>

			<p>Publisher Xbox Game Studios and developers Team Ninja/PlatinumGames have unveiled the official PC system requirements for Ninja Gaiden 4 on the game's store pages. From the looks of it, the game will be very easy to run, considering that the GPU listed in the minimum requirements is the GTX 1060 which launched nine years ago. Granted, this will be at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution set to Quality, and everything set to Low. To play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with Medium settings, you will need an RTX 2060 SUPER.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3400G<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or ​ AMD Radeon™ RX 590(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 30FPS​ FSR quality "Low"​ Object Quality "Low"</p>



<p><br><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060 Super(VRAM 8GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5700XT(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 60FPS ​ FSR Quality "Middle"​ Object Quality "Middle"</p>



<p>Unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, which was remade with Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Gaiden 4 is believed to run on PlatinumGames' proprietary engine. This engine prioritizes performance over visuals, especially for this type of action games that require low latency (and, therefore, high frame rates) to execute pitch-perfect moves.  </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025</a>. Our Francesco De Meo checked it out earlier today, so stay tuned for his hands-on impressions. Hint: as a long-time fan, he was favorably impressed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Fellowship, a multiplayer online dungeon adventure game, or "<em>MODA</em>," as its developer Chief Rebel calls it, will launch in Early Access on Steam this coming October 9, 2025, developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced during the Future Games Show 2025 presentation. You'll be able to try it out ahead of that launch, though, as it'll have an open beta for players next month, from September 18-23.</p>



<p> "<em>All dungeons, all the time</em>," the trailer from today's Future Games Show boasts as it showcases new gameplay from the co-op adventure game, and that really is Fellowship's whole pitch. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo played the upcoming MODA earlier this year</a> ahead of one of its public playtests, he noted that "<em>strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to a press release, Chief Rebel plans to keep the game in early access for six months before reaching its 1.0 launch next year. While the early access version will include all the dungeons you might've already seen during public playtests or that you will see in the upcoming open beta, Chief Rebel is planning to have more playable content arrive as part of the 1.0 version. </p>



<p>The studio will also launch a cosmetics store with the full-game launch, though these cosmetics will remain optional and will not have an impact on gameplay. </p>



<p>Fellowship will be available for $24.99 USD on PC when it launches on October 9.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft doesn't have the biggest presence at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, but it's not entirely absent from the festivities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadow-dropped</a>, and now a new province coming to Anno 117: Pax Romana has been debuted at the convention, alongside the news that fans will get their first chance to play it next month with a free demo launching on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The new province is Albion, bringing its wet lands and expanding on Latium, the province that was first shown off and the one that houses Rome. </p>



<p>Albion is a Celtic province, and it'll be your choice whether you want to keep and encourage Celtic traditions or assimilate the province under Roman customs. Either is viable, but whatever you choose will require its own unique approach and will further shape your own journey in Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo coming next month, it'll only be available for a limited time, from September 2-16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and of course, Ubisoft Connect. So if you want to check it out ahead of its launch this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">November 13</a>, then make sure to clear your gaming schedule for those two weeks, since there's no limit on how many times you can replay the demo.</p>
