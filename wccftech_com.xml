			<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been very long, but it definitely looks like it is almost over, as some lucky fans will be able to try out the game developed by Team Cherry in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>As reported on the ResetERA forums, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will be playable at the Nintendo booth at this year's Gamescom, which takes place from August 20 to August 24 in Cologne, Germany. At the booth, players will also be able to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-suggesting-nintendo-switch-2-release-may-be-imminent/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">Borderlands 4</a>, EA Sports FC 2026, and the already released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.</a></p>



<p>With Hollow Knight: Silksong being playable for the first time to the public this month at both the Nintendo and the Xbox booths, and the game said to be available by the time the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds launch worldwide later this year, a release window which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/">Team Cherry also&nbsp;confirmed</a>, there's no doubt a release date announcement is right around the corner. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/">Yesterday</a>, it was suggested by creator Switchforce, who leaked the Nintendo Indie World Direct happening later today before its official announcement, that the game developed by Team Cherry won't be at the show, but there's still the chance the release date will be announced this month, as the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase on August 19 would be the perfect stage for one of the most anticipated game announcements of the year.</p>

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financial results for Q1 2025</a>, we learned that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 console</a> has now shipped 80.3 million units, breaking the milestone of 80 million. That was thanks to 2.5 million units shipped this quarter, a slight increase compared to the 2.4 million units shipped in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>Overall, it was another excellent quarter for the PlayStation 5, with most indicators trending upward. Full game software sales increased from last year's 53.6 million units to 65.9 million units in the quarter, with a 23% increase. Even first-party game sales went up from 6 million units to 6.9 million units (+15%). The ratio of digital versus physical game sales skewed even more toward digital, which is more great news for Sony, reaching a historic 83%, up from 80% in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>The number of monthly active users (MAUs) on the PlayStation Network also increased, at least compared to Q1 2024, which registered 116 million MAUs, whereas this latest quarter saw 123 million monthly users on the PSN, a 6% increment. Of course, Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 registered higher MAUs (129 and 124 million, respectively), but that is always the case in those quarters.</p>



<p>Overall, sales for the Game and Network Services segment increased by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, the PlayStation 5 is still lagging behind its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, when considering time aligned sales. In June 2018, that console had already shipped 82.3 million units, 2.1 million more than the PS5. </p>



<p>However, the PS5 had other issues to contend with, such as COVID-19, the global chip shortage that lasted from 2020 and 2023, and now increased prices due to the economic environment. All things considered, Sony is probably still happy with how it's going, even if it's selling a little less than the PlayStation 4.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-is-the-fastest-io-interactive-game-to-break-500k-wishlists-on-steam.1264125/</guid>

			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1953139116930986023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that 007 First Light has already surpassed 500K wishlists on Steam. It is the studio's fastest game to do so, beating their previous HITMAN games, though that's not very surprising when factoring in the power of the 007 IP.</p>



<p>As a reward to the community, IO Interactive revealed that the equippable Savanna Bloom skin will be available at release, and a series of animated wallpapers will be shared shortly. Furthermore, there are other 'missions' to complete if even more fans add the game to their wishlists ahead of the release:</p>



<ul>
<li>Milestone 2: Add flair to your fieldwork with a custom gadget skin, and stream like an agent with a bespoke overlay.</li>



<li>Milestone 3: Go in style with a Deluxe agent skin, plus unlock a developer AMA.</li>



<li>Milestone 4: Confidential. The contents of this final reward are top secret, for now…</li>
</ul>

<p>The title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2020 as Project 007. In late 2024, IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it aims to create a 007 gaming franchise, specifically a 'big trilogy'. 007 First Light was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> during Sony's June 2025 State of Play, showing off a cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Players will step into the shoes of a young, reckless, but already resourceful James Bond as he goes through MI6's training program. After a particularly heroic act, the young naval air crewman is offered a spot in the newly revived Double-O program. However, when a mission to stop a rogue agent goes tragically wrong, Bond must team up with his reluctant mentor, Greenway, to expose a deep conspiracy and prevent an impending coup at the heart of the British state.</p>



<p>In short, it is an origin story that includes the events that transformed an audacious young hero into the best MI6 agent. Players will go on missions in breathtaking locations, drive iconic vehicles, and dive into a cinematic adventure in pursuit of a rogue agent who’s always one step ahead.</p>



<p>Owing to IO Interactive's sandbox approach already seen with HITMAN, players will be able to choose their approach: go silent or go loud. They can fight with fists or firepower, use gadgets to infiltrate, or bluff their way past guards. Moreover, 007 First Light will allow them to replay the missions with additional modifiers.</p>



<p>The game is slated to launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
