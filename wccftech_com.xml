			<p>During Sony's September State of Play event, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the final launch date for its long-awaited game Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>The open world action/adventure title will be available starting on March 19, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now across all platforms, with the Standard Edition priced $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced $79.99. The latter provides access to some in-game extra cosmetics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kairos Plate Helm</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Gloves</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Boots</li>



<li>Kairos Cloak</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Armor</li>



<li>Balgran Shield</li>



<li>Exclaire Champron</li>



<li>Exclaire Barding</li>



<li>Exclaire Saddle</li>



<li>Exclaire Stirrups</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Deluxe Edition will be available for $10 more and also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deluxe Edition Limited SteelBook</li>



<li>Map of Pywel</li>



<li>Letter from the Developer</li>



<li>Greymane Brooch Pin</li>



<li>3 Character Photo Cards</li>



<li>3 Patches</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Collector's Edition is priced at $279.99 and adds a stunning 17‚Äù Diorama. All Crimson Desert pre-orders also include the Khaled Shield, and all PS5 pre-orders get the exclusive Grotevant Plate Set. This may be all that remains of t<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hat rumor from two years ago about Pearl Abyss partnering with Sony on the game</a>.</p>

<p>With the game's pre-orders opening, Pearl Abyss also updated its <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously shared PC system requirements</a>. The minimum specs are exactly the same, but the recommended specs have been greatly reduced from the previous recommendations of Ryzen 7 7700X / i7-13700K CPU and RTX 4070 SUPER / RX 7800 XT GPU to Ryzen 5 5600 / i5-11600K and RTX 2080 / RX 6700 XT, likely as a result of ongoing optimization. Crimson Desert is powered by the rather impressive proprietary BlackSpace Engine, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have covered in detail in our GDC 2025 report</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the road is finally in sight for the second triple-A game developed by the studio currently known for the MMORPG Black Desert. Crimson Desert was originally announced pre-COVID at G-Star 2019 and even had a Winter 2021 launch window at some point before <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being delayed indefinitely</a>. Initially, the game was meant to feature some MMO-like elements, but it was revamped into a full-fledged single player action/adventure title, which inevitably required a lot of work. </p>



<p>It won't be long before we judge for ourselves whether the change and the wait were worth it. In the meantime, stay tuned for additional Crimson Desert coverage.</p>
