			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">announced</a> the games being added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for August 2025, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered headlining the 11-total titles added across the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>Technically, for PS Plus Premium subscribers, it's a full 12 games that they'll have access to thanks to their subscription, but the twelfth title is just a new game trial for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, so it doesn't really count to make this month's catalog additions a full 12, since you only get five hours with it before you'd have to buy the game to play the rest.</p>



<p>This month's additions also include a new day-one release, with Sword of the Sea launching into PS Plus Extra when it arrives on August 19. The game comes from some of the same developers who made Journey, and was showcased earlier this year at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play</a> event.</p>
