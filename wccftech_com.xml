			<p><span>The new PlayStation 5 Pro CFI-7121 model, no</span>w available across Europe, comes with some improvements over the original model, a new teardown conducted by&nbsp;Austin Evans&nbsp;confirmed.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between the PlayStation 5 Pro launch model and the CFI-7121 model is better power efficiency for the 2025 model. In tests conducted running Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, the CFI-7121 model proved to be 2 to 3% more power efficient, even running replays in Gran Turismo 7 which push the system the most with full ray tracing support. Thanks to the better power efficiency, the new system also runs slightly cooler than 2024's launch model.</p>



<p>The CFI-7121 model is also noticeably quieter. In the tests, the new unit proved to be 20% quieter than the launch model, representing a 2-decibel difference. The new fan's slightly lower-pitched sound profile further enhances this reduction.</p>



<p>The differences between the two PlayStation 5 Pro models are minimal for the rest. Changes like slightly different fan from another manufacturer, a plastic fan grid in place of a metal grid, a lighter rear heat sink, the removal of some VMMs from the motherboard and a lighter, possibly more efficient power supply, result not only in the enhanced power efficiency, but also in a lighter weight - 3016 grams against the 3103 grams of the launch model.</p>



<p>The changes for the new DualSense controller revision are even smaller. Aside from some small internal changes and parts produced by a different manufacturer than those in a launch controller, the new DualSense only saw the removal of the back microphone. This is a rather small change likely made to keep manufacturing costs down without significantly impacting the controller's performance and functionality.</p>



<p>You can see the full breakdown of these hardware changes, including the fan and heatsink revisions, in Austin Evans' complete teardown video below.</p>

<p>While it was expected that the new PlayStation 5 Pro model would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">around 3% more power efficient than the launch model</a>, the new DualSense V3 controller revision is minimal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">which is not what earlier reports suggested earlier this month</a>. While this may be disappointing for some, the fact that the changes made to the controller don't impact its functionality and keep its price down should still be welcome amidst consistent price increases that have made both<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"> the regular PlayStation 5 </a>and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/"> Xbox Series X|S systems more expensive</a> since their launch in 2020.</p>
