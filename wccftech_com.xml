			<p>According to a new rumor, LEGO Horizon Adventures might be coming to Xbox after all. As you might remember, Microsoft's console was the only one left out of the fun, with the game launching right away on PC, Nintendo Switch, and, obviously, PlayStation. Ahead of the game's launch, Guerrilla Games (which partnered with Studio Gobo to make the spin-off) <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a rather unconvincing explanation for the absence:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Just Play It, though, which doesn't really have a track record when it comes to these leaks. Take it with a big grain of salt, but they're saying the reason is LEGO Horizon Adventures only had a modest commercial performance. They also provide a potential release window for the Xbox version: early 2025.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures attempted to retell Aloy's first adventure in a manner more befitting for younger audiences. However, the game wasn't quite as successful as the original. It got 6.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, a much lower score than Horizon Zero Dawn. Reviewer Nathan Birch shared these final thoughts about the game:</p>
<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really want more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</em></p>

			<p>Xbox fans were certainly surprised to see from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards 2024 trailer</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 was confirmed to launch immediately on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. There's been a lot of conflicting talk about the multiplatform strategy, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating </a>that there are no red lines when it comes to ports to other consoles, only for President of Content and Studios Matt Booty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-executive-says-exclusivity-will-be-considered-on-a-case-by-case-basis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> a few days ago it would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Even Obsidian's 2025 games show that inner conflict, with Avowed only currently announced for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden confidently <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867638349760196645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted on X</a> that real exclusives for Microsoft's console exclusives are essentially gone for good in the company's plans.</p>
<p><em>Xbox won't have exclusives going forward. Everything is timed exclusive at most. If some games are exclusive it's gonna be incidental at best, the "case by case" argument is by and large going to be multiplatform, timed, and with maybe a few (very few) outliers.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the exclusivity status of Playground's Fable (which is scheduled to launch sometime next year), he replied:</p>
<p><em>That game was monstrously expensive. It might not be day one, but it'll come with the current plan in place, in my opinion.</em></p>
<p>Where does that leave Xbox hardware, though? Corden believes it won't be shut down...Unless it <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to shrink</a> as it has over the past few quarters. In that case, all bets are off.</p>
<p><em>I don't think they'll stop providing hardware as long as the users and revenue are there. But growth is the issue. Without finding growth elsewhere, the shareholders won't accept it, especially with the 70 billion ABK scrutiny.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't think they'll shut it down. It'll just be flat. When you're a giant company with trillions in market cap, flat isn't viable. They need to grow beyond console for that, but maintaining what they have will power that effort. </em><em>If... it doesn't shrink. And it may well.</em></p>
<p>So far, out of the five Xbox exclusives announced for next year, only The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> are already confirmed to launch on PlayStation 5, too. However, the likelihood of Fable, South of Midnight, and Avowed getting there is pretty high.</p>
