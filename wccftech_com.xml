			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (an internal developer of Krafton) <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that their namesake game will be released <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a> in early 2026, while an Xbox port is still under consideration:</p>



<p><em>Weâ€˜re excited to announce that inZOI is scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5) in 2026.</em> <em>Our team is working hard to bring you the best possible experience on PS5. (An Xbox release is also under consideration, but not yet confirmed.) The official release date and additional details will be shared at a later time.</em></p>



<p>inZOI is a life simulation game that debuted on Steam Early Access on March 28. It had a lot of hype going for it, as it proved when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller just one week after launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mixed', with only 47% of the 618 reviews left in the last month giving it a thumbs up. Some fans believe that inZOI needs a lot more content and features before it can launch out of early access. </p>



<p>Given the projected early 2026 PS5 launch and the fact that early access games do not generally debut before version 1.0 on Sony's console, it's a fair assumption that the developers are sticking to their original one-year early access phase. The 1.0 release on PC and PS5 could therefore be internally scheduled for March 2026, though of course, the team should do well to heed the community's concerns and possibly delay the full launch if it serves the purpose of addressing their feedback and delivering a better final product.</p>



<p>In June, inZOI also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-gets-official-modkit-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received an official Modkit update</a> that allows users to craft and share user-generated content (UGC) with a specific tool available for free via the Epic Games Store. It is unclear whether that will be available on PlayStation 5; consoles are usually more restrictive in this area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 fiscal year 2025 presentation</a>, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the delay of Crimson Desert. The upcoming action/adventure game was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in Q4 2025</a>, but it has been pushed back one quarter, as the Pearl Abyss CEO revealed:</p>



<p><em>Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</em></p>



<p><em>The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>



<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week.</em></p>



<p>Unfortunate news for anyone looking to play Crimson Desert this year, to be sure, but no doubt the final version will benefit from a little bit more polish. Besides, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to be launched as far back as Winter 2021</a>, but then the developers went back to the drawing board and reworked it considerably from the original MMO-like plan into a single player open world game. At this point, a few more months won't make that much of a change.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the executive's quote, Crimson Desert will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-is-bringing-crimson-desert-back-to-gamescom-with-another-playable-demo-at-this-years-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable in a new build at Gamescom</a>, PAX West, and Tokyo Game Show. We will be there at Gamescom to check out this new version and report back, so stay tuned. As a reminder, the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/paypal-only-processing-steam-purchases-eur-cad-gbp-jpy-aud-usd/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paypal-is-only-processing-steam-purchases-in-eur-cad-gbp-jpy-aud-and-usd.1268490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An image has appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">Reddit</a> that includes a statement explaining that PayPal is no longer processing Steam purchases in currencies other than the following six: Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or United States Dollars.</p>



<p>The image shows an answer from Steam Support as to why using PayPal in the user's current currency (which is presumably not one of the above six) is unavailable. "<em>In early July 2025</em>," the statement reads, "<em>PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future,</em>" the statement continues, "<em>but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this</em>." The statement then concludes by suggesting the user try a different payment method, including adding funds to their Steam wallet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the first official statement from Valve on the issue, though players have been complaining about the problems on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/595154293314559955/">Steam forums since early July</a>, which lines up with the timeline shared by Valve. One user who commented on the forum linked above claims to have made a purchase on Steam through PayPal, not in one of the aforementioned six currencies just three days prior to July 12, 2025. So we at least have some idea as to when this began.</p>



<p>It's unclear as to why PayPal's acquiring banks are blocking any purchases on Valve's platform not in one of six currencies, but the timeline of everything has many speculating that it has something to do with the current issues around <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/">payment processors seemingly putting pressure on Valve to remove certain kinds of games from its platform</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the timing, there's no concrete connection between PayPal's affiliated banks no longer processing purchases on Steam due to the campaign to have certain kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-have-confidence-in-age-rating-systems/">adult and NSFW content removed from videogame platforms like Steam and Itch.io</a>. </p>
