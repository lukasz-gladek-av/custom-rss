			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo's</a> latest report on the top games globally by revenue and monthly active users (MAU) for May 2025 shows just how strong of a start <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> had, while Bethesda's return to Cyrodiil with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> firmly remaining in the top-20 games for both revenue and MAU.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launched right at the end of May on the 30th, and even though it arrived just before the month was done, it still managed to hit the number four spot on the top-20 games by revenue for May 2025. The only games ahead of it were the live service regulars, with Fortnite in the top spot, EA Sports FC 25 in second and Call of Duty in third.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered remains in the top-20 two months in a row, for both MAU and revenue, while the other major release from an Xbox-owned studio, id Software's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, makes the top-10 revenue list in the number nine spot.</p>
<p>Other notable titles on the revenue list are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which beat DOOM at number eight, and on the MAU list, the hype around <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> continues to go strong as it came in at number 15 for May 2025. Also, funnily enough, beating DOOM: The Dark Ages, which came in at number 16.</p>
<p>Here's Newzoo's full report overview for the top games on PC and consoles for May 2025:</p>
<h2>Engagement Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</strong>(#4, +1) saw a jump in engagement following the release of GTA VI’s second trailer on May 6 – the trailer amassed a record-breaking 475 million views across all platforms in the first 24 hours.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Apex Legends&nbsp;</strong>(#12, +3) gained 3 positions as it saw the introduction of a new Legend, Sparrow, and return of a legacy 3 vs 3 game mode – Arena, in a content update released on May 6.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>HELLDIVERS 2&nbsp;</strong>(#14, +18) saw a major content update on May 13 that introduced weapon customization, new enemies and balance adjustments. Moreover, on May 20 the “Heart of Democracy” update introduced urban environments to the game as players are now able to fight on Super Earth itself. The event not only diversifies gameplay but also builds the game’s tradition of turning events into meaningful community moments, driving strong player engagement.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Star Wars Battlefront II (2017)&nbsp;</strong>(#15, +90) experienced a significant surge in player engagement in May, through an organic community rally — highlighting strong and growing demand for a third installment in the series. This uptick followed Star Wars Day (May 4), which was marked by major discounts across all platforms that drew in new players. Despite the influx, 86% of May’s engagement came from returning players, underscoring the dedication and loyalty of the Battlefront II community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(16, new) launched to very positive reviews (86% on Steam and 86% Top Critic Average on Open Critic) and attracted massive amounts of players thanks to its day one availability on the Game Pass. Xbox users accounted for 72% of MAU, highlighting the platform’s dominant role in its success.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</h2>
<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>*We are currently experiencing a temporary outage which affects ROBLOX PC Revenues</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</strong>&nbsp;(#4, new) launched to mixed Steam reviews but has since managed to claw its way to ‘Very Positive’ at 80%. Our 6-market estimate sits at 3.5 million copies in May. The quick turnaround highlights the resilience of the ELDEN RING IP.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</strong>(#8, +5) moves up in the ranking after the release month, which is unusual for a premium title. It’s a showcase of the strength of a high-quality game and continued word-of-mouth marketing.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(#9, new) lands quite low on the list due to a big portion of revenues being tied to The Xbox Game Pass. In contrast to what we observed in the engagement highlights, over 95% of full game sales of the title come from PlayStation and PC (Steam).</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong>&nbsp;(#11, +30) announced a new paid ($39.99) expansion which became available for pre-order on May 6. Players enjoy regular events and new game modes as the game ramps up for the release of the expansion on July 15.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (</strong>#15, -13) makes it to the top 20 for the second month in a row, showcasing the hunger for a Bethesda fantasy RPG in the gaming community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</strong>(#20, new) launched to ‘Very Positive’ reviews (91% on Steam) and has already surpassed a million units sold across all platforms according to official communication from the developers. The blend of coziness and RPG elements has landed well with its target audience.</em></li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation Is Now Available in Eternal Strands]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update due today for the action/adventure fantasy game Eternal Strands is set to add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. The game has offered support for DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex since its launch in January 2025, and it's also possible to switch to the latest transformer AI model via the NVIDIA app, improving image quality. Now, though, the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will boost the frame rates of GeForce RTX 50 Series owners even further.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands admittedly already ran pretty well on release, as noted by Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review for Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>The developer also managed to keep the known UE5 stuttering issues to a minimum, as the game runs rather well most of the time. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution, epic settings with NVIDIA DLSS at the Ultra Quality setting, and Frame Generation at an average of 118 FPS in a benchmark session held in the Upper Dynevron map, one of the maps featuring the highest enemy density. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation off, the game ran at an average of 89 FPS on the same map, which was extremely playable. The recorded 1% lows, 25 and 35, however, highlight how there's still some stuttering here and there, but it's honestly not that noticeable. Considering the state of the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games and all the taxing simulation the game is doing at almost all times, I was expecting much worse, but there hasn't been a single time in my 35+ hours playthrough where framerates dipped so low that the game was unplayable.</em></p>
<p>Tomorrow, a seasonal update to the F2P anime third-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strinova </a>will introduce NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Similarly, later this week, another patch will add DLSS Super Resolution to Monster Energy Supercross 25 - The Official Video Game.</p>
<p>Lastly, on July 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV Season 9: Sins of the Horadrim</a> will introduce native NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support to Blizzard's game; the feature was previously only available through the NVIDIA app. The new season adds hidden Horadric Strongrooms deep within Nightmare Dungeons that conceal Blood Relics corrupted by Astaroth’s influence. Players can harness ancient Horadric magic to craft custom Horadric spells, forge powerful jewels, and face a reimagined Astaroth encounter.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developer The Chinese Room has been hit with layoffs, confirmed the game's publisher, Paradox Interactive. It's unclear how many developers have been impacted, though Paradox claims that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 "<em>is unaffected</em>" by the cuts.</p>
<p>The first reports of the layoffs came from now-former developers at The Chinese Room, who took to LinkedIn to announce that they had lost their jobs. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, one employee wrote, "<em>We are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around</em>." At least nine former employees have confirmed they were laid off, though the total number of cuts remains unknown.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn posts and Game Developer's report, Paradox Interactive confirmed the layoffs to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PC Gamer</a>, with a statement that reads "<em>Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release. We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors</em>."</p>
<p>It's no secret that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been through the wringer, so to speak, as we've been waiting on this game since it was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">2019</a>. It was also at risk of being canceled at least once before, when it was being developed by Hardsuit Labs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room took over development in 2021, and has been picking up where Hardsuit Labs left off while also developing its own titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>. These layoffs are the latest event in the long development journey that Bloodlines 2 has gone through.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/">Earlier this year,</a> Paradox Interactive confirmed that Bloodlines 2 is due for an October release date, though a specific release date has yet to be provided. According to Paradox, the game is "<em>done</em>," and the studio is working on polishing it and squashing every bug it can up to its October date. After all this time, seeing what arrives when Bloodlines 2 is out and on shelves will be interesting. Hopefully, it's a triumphant return for the series and the game that fans have been waiting for.</p>
