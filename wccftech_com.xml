			<p>Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would split itself into two entities by mid-2026. The first one, WBD Global Networks, will remain focused on the company's traditional cable programming with sports, news, and entertainment; the second entity, WBD Streaming and Studios, will spin off with HBO, the TV series and movie production, as well as the gaming division of Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>
<p>Many analysts have identified the possible motive behind the split in a potential sale of the latter, way more successful side of company. Now, just a few days after the announcement, the wrestling scoop website SEScoops <a href="https://www.sescoops.com/news/buyer-eyeing-warner-bros-new-streaming-spin-off-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> Sony is already considering purchasing WBD Streaming and Studios.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this would make perfect sense for Sony from a strategic standpoint. It would considerably bolster its movie, TV series, and gaming production and give it access to some of the biggest intellectual properties in entertainment, such as the DC universe, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.</p>

<p>Now, it's all a bit premature at this stage since the split will have to happen first. As such, even if an acquisition deal is eventually reached, it may not be announced until 2027 or thereabouts. Regarding the legitimacy of the source, SEScoops has a long track record when it comes to wrestling leaks, but it's still worth taking the rumor with a big grain of salt.</p>
<p>Moving to analyze the gaming side, we know Warner Bros. Discovery has suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy losses</a> in that division. Despite the massive success of Hogwarts Legacy, several other games failed, such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Gotham Knights, and MultiVersus. Moreover, the historic studio Monolith was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>, and its original Wonder Woman game was canceled.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of a restructuring within Warner Bros. Games around its four key IPs: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and Mortal Kombat. It's hard to say whether Sony's acquisition would improve this division's situation in any meaningful way. Gamers probably shouldn't be too concerned about those games becoming PlayStation exclusive, though; they are simply too big to make sense as exclusives. Sony has already realized that when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed</a> Bungie to continue making multiplatform games following its acquisition.</p>

			<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">Variety</a>, Warner Bros. has restructured its WB Games branch into four divisions focused on four key franchises: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and the DC Universe.</p>
<p>The restructuring has promoted three former studio heads to oversee games made for each of these major franchises. Former WB Games Montreal studio head Yves Lachance is now a senior vice president of development for Harry Potter and Game of Thrones projects, while NetherRealm studio head Shaun Himmerick is now a senior vice president of development for Mortal Kombat and DC Universe projects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, former WB Games New York studio head, Steven Flenory, is now the senior vice president of central technology and services, overseeing publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance, and user research.</p>
<p>Every studio under WB Games will now report to Lachance and Himmerick, in accordance with the games they're making and which franchises those games come from. So, the team at Avalanche Software working on a new Hogwarts Legacy game would report to Lachance, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">Rocksteady</a>, who is presumably working on a new game set in the DC Universe, would report to Himmerick.</p>
<p>Lachance, Himmerick, and Flenory will all report to WB's global streaming and games chief executive officer, JB Perrette.</p>
<p>According to Variety's report, this restructuring did not result in any layoffs or executive departures, which is good news on the layoff front.</p>
<p>"<em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat and DC games</em>," said JB Perrette per Variety's report.</p>
<p>"<em>We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them nd the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Warner Bros confirmed that its WB Games division reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">"<em>disappointing</em>"</a> revenues, shortly after former WB Games chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">David Haddad,</a> left the company following the failure of games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus.</p>
<p>Warner Bros also shut down veteran studio Monolith Productions, MultiVersus developer Player First Games, and its San Diego Studio, which was meant to develop a mobile game but never had the chance to release anything.</p>
<p>This is also the latest example of the company doubling-down on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-to-refocus-business-around-tentpole-franchises-and-top-tier-characters-">previous statements</a> that it would focus its games business on the four aforementioned franchises.</p>
