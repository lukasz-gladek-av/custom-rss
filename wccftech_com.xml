			<p>At the time of this writing, we are one week and a day away from Battlefield 6 launching on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 platforms. We've known it would be a major release for the series, potentially even its biggest release, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">its multiplayer beta absolutely blew up earlier this year,</a> and now a new report shows just how big it'll be, and how big it's projected to be.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">The Game Business</a> reveals a couple of new statistics from data firm Ampere Analysis. According to Ampere, Battlefield 6 already has 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone, and the firm further predicts that it'll hit 5 million units sold within its first week.</p>



<p>Other notable statistics shared in the report include Newzoo's estimate that the beta was played by 25 million people, while Ampere sits slightly below that number in their estimates at 22 million. Newzoo also reports that the peak concurrent player count for the Battlefield 6 beta across all platforms was 10.4 million, double that of Battlefield 2042's beta, which peaked at 5.1 million.</p>



<p>Even if the reality of the Battlefield vs. Call of Duty bout this year is that Call of Duty will still sell far better, these stats are all signs that EA is making a strong effort to bring the Battlefield series back into fighting shape.</p>



<p>Who knows, we could see the next Battlefield game surpass Call of Duty in the near future, especially if Call of Duty <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to suffer from its current identity crisis</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, just days before Call of Duty Next, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-trailer-takes-shot-at-call-of-duty/">EA took a few direct shots at Call of Duty and its identity struggles</a> in a live-action trailer for Battlefield 6. EA also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">unveiled the post-launch roadmap for Battlefield 6 and its introductory season</a>. </p>

			<p>Frictional Games, the studio behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amnesia-the-bunker-walking-forward-into-the-abyss/">beloved horror series Amnesia</a> and <a href="http://wccftech.com/soma-is-a-great-horror-adventure-for-pc-ps4-but-how-do-the-2-versions-compare/">sci-fi horror game SOMA</a>, has teased its next project with a new eerie trailer simply titled 'Frictional_Next_Project.mp4.' The trailer is a series of slow zooming and panning shots of spaces, some of them seeming to be from a grand hall of sorts, others from a research lab, and others from the hidden spaces behind a wall.</p>



<p>While the shots switch from one space to another, an echo of voices chanting something quite difficult to make out adds to the atmosphere, along with its dark and moody lighting all throughout the trailer.</p>

<p>The description for the video includes <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">a link to a website for Hotel Samsara</a>, which seems to be a fictional hotel that can be recognized from some of the shots in the trailer. There's also a space to request updates by putting in your email, which brings up an odd question, asking if you are "<em>One of many</em>" or "<em>One and only</em>."</p>



<p>It all seems like hints and clues towards what this new project will be, but a lot of players in the Frictional Games community are already pointing towards it being a new game in SOMA's universe. Community members<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15fHWr4f_nTwOzgOYJt9vzrXY3K_RioAdeOHYLAWgnp8/edit?gid=1569727250#gid=1569727250"> have even put together a spreadsheet</a> detailing what they believe to be clues pointing towards it being a new SOMA game.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn more about this new project soon. </p>
