			<p>We're now less than a month away from the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a>, which in itself seems impossible to process. The game has had so many delays (some forced on the developers by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, for example) that even the most attached fans were skeptical at some point.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is almost here, though. GSC Game World recently hosted a final press event in Prague where they shared a few extra details about their game. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1msvzkT1d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by Radio Times Gaming, for example, Technical Producer Yevhenii Kulyk talked about optimization after the interviewer mentioned the many recent Unreal Engine games suffering from stuttering issues on PC.</p>
<p><em>To meet our expectations for optimization on Xbox and PCs, we made a lot of changes to render threads, some CPU optimizations, and a lot of RAM optimizations. Now we are pretty much close to finishing the whole polishing process. Our aim is to provide a game that is running constantly in stable FPS and with stable performance all the time.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the Unreal Engine 5 version they've been using, Kulyk said:</p>
<p><em>Our engine is based on Unreal Engine 5.1, but we internally call it 5.1.GSC because to make a world this big, we had to adopt and, let's say, maybe rewrite and upgrade some tools that were provided by the basic Unreal Engine to fit our needs to create the world of STALKER 2.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-says-ue5s-nanite-and-lumen-were-the-right-bricks-to-properly-finish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the news of upgrading from UE4 to UE5, stating that Lumen and Nanite were the 'right bricks' to finish the game. However, Epic introduced several performance and quality improvements to both technologies in the more recent UE5 versions; let's hope staying on an older, albeit custom, build won't jeopardize the performance. After all, the team seems confident in their promise of a smooth frame rate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kulyk reiterated what we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in our exclusive Gamescom interview: mods are coming, to both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><em>We are aware that our player base, especially the old fans, is waiting for our game to support mods. We will bring in the mods to consoles, so they will be available on the Xbox as well as the PC We are preparing a very big toolkit that will provide the mod makers with all the necessary tools to create mods, from the smallest one to big total conversions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out on November 20 on PC and Xbox Series S|X, available from day one on Game Pass. A PlayStation 5 release hasn't been publicly talked about yet, but we know from a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a three-month exclusivity window in place, so the game could launch on Sony's console in early 2025.</p>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has announced a slight delay to the early access date of Path of Exile 2. The sequel to the highly popular free-to-play hack 'n' slash action RPG will now debut on December 6 instead of November 15 as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-on-november-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Game Director Jonathan Rogers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the news in a brief video message and explained that it was caused by server-side shortcomings:</p>
<p><em>I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off around our launches, but we just have to do it. So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn't really the game itself that we're behind on. It's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2 but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</em></p>
<p><em>When you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person’s account name just random gibberish that doesn't even decode? We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken.</em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, because we're changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn’t fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we're expecting at the Path of Exile 2 early access launch. I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original date, but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of mistakes we just can't let happen. With that in mind, we've decided to delay.</em></p>
<p>Rogers ended the message with news of an upcoming live stream that will delve deeply into everything that's going to be in the early access launch. The Game Director said it's going to be like the biggest League announcement they have ever done, and he added he's looking forward to sharing information on the endgame content players will find in Path of Exile 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bungie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a small video developer update for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming extraction shooter</a> based on the sci-fi Marathon IP. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Game Director</a> Joe Ziegler (who previously worked on The Saboteur at Pandemic and Valorant at Riot) talked a bit about how the game is going to work:</p>
<p><em>We give you a lot of different tools to do a lot of different things inside the game. There is a ton of loot that you can find: weapons, equipment that you can equip that changes your stats or tweaks some of the things that you can do inside the game. There are utility consumables akin to mines or grenades, and there are even consumables to heal yourself and give you utility in that way.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, there is also another layer: Runners. They are the template by which you equip all that stuff to. Each Runner has a small subset of abilities and on top of that, you get to customize however you want, thinking about what you want to accomplish. You might equip different types of gear to your Runner and then go on those runs with that gear in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a lot of different ways a Marathon session can unfold with all those different pieces. There are also many objectives and things like that that exist inside the game. But of course, every single one comes with its own risk. And the risk is always present that if you don't get out alive, you will lose the things that you have on you.</em></p>
<p>In the latter half of the video, Ziegler said that Bungie has collaborated with some players and creators to iterate on the game over the past two years. Next year, fans can expect to learn a lot more about the game toward the middle of the year, likely during the regular May PlayStation Showcase. In 2025, Marathon will also greatly expand its player testing with each new milestone.</p>
