			<p>Big changes are underway at Netflix, as the executive who led the streaming giant's foray into gaming has been confirmed to have left the company less than six months after assuming a new role.</p>
<p>As confirmed to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, Mike Verdu, former Vice President of Netflix's GenAI, has left the company for undisclosed reasons. GameFile asked the executive for comment but did not return the request.</p>
<p>Mike Verdu joined Netflix back in 2021 to help the company launch its gaming division, whose reins he left to former EA and Ubisoft executive Alain Tascan last July, then assuming the role of<a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/"> vice president of GenAI</a>, the company's division focused on generative AI. This transition was reportedly planned, although the quick exit from the company as a whole only five months after assuming a new role suggests that other issues may have been ongoing behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Considering how generative AI is becoming more and more prominent, it is unlikely Netflix's plans for GenAI are going to change with Mike Verdu leaving the company. The former vice president highlighted, last year, how he was focused on "<em>a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant."</em> This is a vision that is shared among big publishers such as Microsoft, who recently revealed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/">Muse AI model</a> that is capable of generating gameplay, but it remains to be seen how much they will stick to the idea of generative AI empowering developers, and not use it to take their jobs away.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, WindowsCentral's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a report</a> detailing Microsoft's plans for the next-generation Xbox as well as the long-awaited Xbox handheld. As for the former, the report said a successor to the Series X is already in the works for a targeted 2027 release window.</p>
<p>When it comes to the latter, Microsoft is allegedly planning its own handheld system (also due in 2027), but the report also mentioned an Xbox-partnered handheld device codenamed Project Keenan due this year with the partnership of a PC OEM manufacturer.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his own (paywalled) report</a> in the latest Notepad newsletter. First, the project's correct codename is Kennan, not Keenan. Second, his sources revealed that the Xbox handheld's manufacturer is ASUS. The device will run on Windows, of course, but it will feature an interface very much reminiscent of the Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>This is reportedly part of a larger project codenamed Project Bayside to unify Xbox and Windows under a unified Xbox user interface regardless of the device being used. Warren also wrote that Microsoft is working to ensure a single store for games and an easier way for game developers to create titles for handhelds, console-like hardware, and PCs.</p>
<p>At CES 2025, Microsoft's Jason Ronald, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem, openly teased this concept when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that they've worked hard to bring the best of console and PC together, drawing on their long-time experiences on both platforms, as part of their Xbox handheld efforts. Right now, Windows-powered PC handhelds don't really offer the most user-friendly experience, and Microsoft aims to address that with this initiative.</p>
<p>Following Warren's report, Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> another article to admit that the colleague was right on the Project Kennan codename. He also corroborated that ASUS is indeed the chosen manufacturer and offered an estimate on the likely pricing: between $499 and $599. This could hint that the hardware could be using AMD's Z2 Go chipset previously seen on the Lenovo Legion Go S. The Z2 Go chipset is <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-go-slower-than-z1-extreme-lenovo-legion-go-asus-rog-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly slower than the Z1 Extreme</a> and quite a bit slower than its larger sibling, the Z2 Extreme. However, it's still more powerful than the APU currently available in Valve's Steam Deck. The Xbox handheld would, therefore, sit somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to performance, although again, this information is not at all assured.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more details.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Unreal Engine 5 Oblivion Remake Could Be Revealed and Launched Soon]]></title>

			<p>Two months ago, the long-running Oblivion remake rumors (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated</a> from the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit 'leak' from two years back) intensified greatly following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed report</a> from MP1st.</p>
<p>That report mentioned Virtuos had been working on porting The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. Virtuos previously worked on Obsidian's The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition and is a co-development partner for Konami's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>According to the report, the remake features improvements in six key areas (other than the visuals, which is a given): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and Heads Up Display.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has also been improved and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system has also been tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, the developers have reportedly improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing in third or first person view.</p>
<p>Now, leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that Bethesda could officially unveil this Oblivion remake in March or April at the latest, with a release that could come shortly afterward. The insider added that June was the original target, but the launch could happen even sooner. VideoGamesChronicle has subsequently not only backed Nate's rumor but also <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the remake could be released as early as next month.</p>
<p>Of course, the 2006 open world roleplaying game doesn't need a lot of marketing. Fans are already very excited to be getting not one but two renditions when you factor in Skyblivion, the fan-made recreation of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Are you ready to return to the Imperial City?</p>
