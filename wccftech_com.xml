			<p>Half-Life 2 RTX can be easily fixed to look much closer to the original game in terms of ambiance and atmosphere with some choice tweaks showcased in a recent video.</p>
<p>The video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2kliksphilip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2kliksphilip</a> highlights how volumetrics and light bounce impact the ambiance in the currently available demo of the RTX Remix project the most. The first is easily fixed by reducing the Max Accumulation Distance, which makes volumetrics update much faster once a light source has been covered, and the Froxel Max Distance settings, which, reduced to 0, completely eliminates fog and similar effects.</p>
<p>The other setting that was changed to make Half-Life 2 RTX look much closer to the original is the Max Expected Average Radiance, which was set to 0 to limit how much lighting bounces around. This creates a much darker atmosphere that's more in line with the limited light bounce the Source 1 engine was capable of.&nbsp; The amazing adjustability of RTX Remix has also allowed the modder to show how Ravenholm would look during the early morning by setting a negative value to fog distance.</p>

<p>Besides being an excellent showcase of how RTX Remix can significantly upgrade older games' visuals, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is also an excellent showcase of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-showcase-sampler-feedback-vram/">Sampler Feedback technology</a>, which can be used to significantly lower VRAM usage, which can be a game-changer in the future for those playing games on GPUs with low VRAM.

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 design registration went live this week, complete with some illustrations that provide another look at the system launching later this year worldwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmdsview-web/#/dsview/detail/GB702025006431128-0001">design registration</a>, which was spotted by Famiiboards forums member <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691253">fwd-bwd</a>, features different illustrations showcasing the system from different angles, allowing users to get a good look at how the ports are placed on the top and the bottom of the console, where the microSD card slot is located, how the system looks with the kickstand opened up and more. According to user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>, based on the screen size of 7.9", the console dimensions should be around 201 x 115 x 14 mm.</p>

<p>While yesterday's Nintendo Direct wasn't supposed to reveal anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, we still learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-system-overhauls-digital-game-system-introducing-lending-of-digital-games-and-more/">Virtual Game Card system</a>, which will overhaul the original console's digital games system, will also be compatible with the upcoming system. The launch of the Nintendo Today app also brought the confirmation that the new button found on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-patent-mouse/">Joy-Con controller</a>&nbsp;is indeed called the C button, although its function still remains a mystery. Thankfully, it won't take long to finally know what this button will do, what the Nintendo Switch 2 is capable of, and which games will be available <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">at launch</a>, as the Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the system will air in five days, on April 2nd.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games have canceled Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition even before its official announcement. The news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who was also the first to report on its existence <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2024</a>. Avalanche Software was developing this version of the best-selling game of 2023 with the help of Rocksteady. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was scheduled to launch in 2025 with 10–15 hours of new content and a price of $20–30 for owners of the base game.</p>
<p>This more or less lines up with Schreier's new report, which says that it would have restored a cut storyline tied to one of the game's companions. However, Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was canceled partly because Warner Bros. Games was concerned that the amount of new content would not be enough to justify the price. Ultimately, they must have thought it was simply not worth the effort instead of going for a lower price.</p>
<p>It's a shame, especially since I was really hoping that Avalanche Software and Rocksteady would take the opportunity to fix or at least greatly reduce the awful stuttering that still plagues the game on PC, even with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation enabled <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a GeForce RTX 5090</a>. At least the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently updated</a> with official modding support on PC, although I doubt that it will take off in as big a way as it does for Bethesda's games and a few others.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Bloomberg report also clarifies that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel is still in development at Avalanche Software, though there were few doubts about that, given that the original has sold over 34 million units to date. Schreier recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the sequel won't be a live service game, despite prior comments from Warner Bros. Games about wanting to expand the franchise into that area.</p>
