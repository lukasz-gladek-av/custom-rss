			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-close-to-you-short-pikmin-super-mario-galaxy-movie-tease-speculation/">released an animated short titled "<em>Close to You</em>"</a> with absolutely no explanation as to what it could be referring to. There were definite hints, like a blurry Pikmin seen in the background of a shot and the music coming from Pikmin 4, but we couldn't say for certain that it was anything Pikmin-related, or if it potentially had something to do with the Super Mario Galaxy movie, or if it was something else entirely.</p>



<p>Well, today Nintendo answered one of those questions for us. On its Nintendo Today app, the company released a new version of the "<em>Close to You</em>" video, though this time, instead of the little baby's toys and soother appearing to move around by magic, we can see clearly that there were invisible little Pikmin all around the room.</p>



<p>So it is a Pikmin-related project, that much we can say. What that project is, however, is still another question entirely. It could, of course, be the beginning of a marketing campaign that will lead into the release of Pikmin 5. It could also be our first look at a new project from Nintendo's new Nintendo Pictures arm, which would explain why there's been no sign of Illumination or Universal in either of the videos.</p>



<p>If that's the case, then this could potentially be a new film or a new TV series based on Pikmin. At the time of this writing, just like the original version of the video that was posted to Nintendo's social accounts, the Nintendo Today app, and Nintendo's YouTube channels simultaneously, this new version comes with no added explanation as to what it is. It's also still only available to watch on the Nintendo Today app, and has yet to be shared to the aforementioned verticals so far.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn even more about whatever this project is soon. Perhaps we just need to wait another day for the full reveal to arrive tomorrow morning.</p>
