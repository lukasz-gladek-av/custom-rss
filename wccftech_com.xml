			<p><strong>Update 25/07/2025:</strong> A spokesperson for Survios has confirmed to Wccftech that those who already own Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One as a VR game <strong>will have to buy the Evolved Edition separately</strong> if they want to play the new flat-screen version. </p>



<p>"<em>Currently those who own Alien: Rogue Incursion will have to repurchase the Evolved Edition</em>," we were told in an email. </p>



<p>It's possible, of course, that this changes from now to the September release date. But it's unfortunate to know that for now, players who have already paid for the game, who might've also wanted to try it out as a flat-screen title, can't do that without buying the whole game again. Hopefully, for those players, Survios changes its mind and makes it available as a free update for current owners. Or at least an upgrade path is introduced, with a reduced fee to get the new version as well.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One first launched last year on PS5 and PC as a VR game for PS VR2 and PC VR before heading to Meta Quest 3 earlier this year. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/">May</a>, developer Survios announced that a new version of the game, which makes it playable as a flat-screen title called Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, and today, during San Diego Comic-Con, the studio revealed the first look at gameplay for the new version arriving on September 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer shows a few quick shots of how the new version essentially boils down the VR shooter to a more run-of-the-mill horror shooter.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are also live as of today, and if you don't already own the Evolved Edition, then you can grab it for $29.99 USD, with the digital deluxe edition for $39.99 USD. While we've asked Survios for clarification, it's not exactly clear if the Evolved Edition will be available to players who already own VR version of the game as a free update, or if this is an entirely new SKU and needs to be purchased separately.</p>



<p>So if you wanted to shoot Xenomorphs in a more classic shooter fashion without having to don a VR headset, then you might need to be ready to buy the game again. We'll update this story if Survios releases a clear statement on the matter.</p>



<p>And in the meantime, if you've already played the VR version, then you can rest easy knowing that Surivos is <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1931110743933645240">still working on Part Two</a>, though the studio has not given any indication as to when Part Two will arrive.</p>
