			<p>Today, Chinese developer GameScience announced the Xbox release date of its highly acclaimed action RPG Black Myth Wukong. The game will debut on Xbox Series S and X consoles on August 20, 2025, exactly one year after the launch on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The issue of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> was long disputed among the fanbase and even between GameScience and Microsoft itself. The developer of Black Myth Wukong openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the low amount of RAM available on the Xbox Series S was causing optimization headaches that had to be resolved before the launch. Microsoft, on the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that the Xbox console was not the issue.</p>
<p>It's hard to know where the truth lies in this case, but it is quite peculiar that everything has been worked out to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the same. It's definitely possible that there was a silent timed exclusivity deal with Sony. After all, a PlayStation executive <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in an interview that the Content Ventures team supported games like Genshin Impact, Stellar Blade, and Black Myth Wukong, and the two other games did launch on PlayStation first.</p>
<p>Anyway, pre-orders for the Xbox version will open on June 18. On the same day, GameScience has also planned to kick off the first discount campaign, which will reduce the price by 20%. Thankfully, the same will apply to Xbox pre-orders from June 18 to July 11.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong was a smashing success for GameScience, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over 18 million units</a> in just the first two weeks. More importantly for Xbox gamers, it's a damn good game well worth playing if you're into its genre, as explained thoroughly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science. Although their action role-playing game may not be innovative, it's got great production values, it's fun to play, it's engaging, and it's beautiful to look at. Some minor issues, such as a challenge level that could be too low for some and an experience that gets a little stale over time, hold back the game a bit, but in all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised to see more than a few players name Black Myth: Wukong their Game of the Year.</em></p>
