			<p>A few hours ago, Fatshark announced the release of the first paid DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>. Priced at $11.99 for the Standard Edition and at $18.99 for the Deluxe Edition, the DLC provides access to a new class, the Adeptus Arbites, who can rely on a Cyber-Mastiff companion, which players can customize in name and looks. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help players against anything that comes too close. The Cyber-Mastiff can also be commanded to attack a specific target, which will override any behavior of its own. To command the Cyber-Mastiff, double-tap the Tag Input on any enemy eligible to be Tagged.</p>
<p>Arbites have plenty of options to customize their playstyle, with Talent Tree sections like Elite Killing and Cyber-Mastiff Handling, Hybrid Combat and Supportive Utility, and Crowd Control and Melee. Those who don't enjoy having a companion can even grab the Lone-Wolf talent, which removes access to the Cyber-Mastiff but provides +15% Toughness Damage Reduction, +10% Attack Speed, +10% Damage, +1 increased Charges on your Blitz Abilities, and replenishes a charge of Blitz Ability every 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Alongside the Arbites DLC, Warhammer 40K Darktide was also updated with a free patch titled The Battle for Tertium. The core player experience has been overhauled to provide a clearer narrative focus on the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign featuring new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to make it easier for new players to get started and gradually unlock features previously restricted by character level. Previously, each new player's experience was completely random. However, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies, and characters in a specific order, enabling players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p>
<p>Fatshark has even introduced a new mission board system. Missions will no longer be tied to a specific difficulty, meaning you can select a mission and then choose your desired difficulty. This effectively increases the number of mission options available to players of all levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty system in Warhammer 40K Darktide has been completely revamped. Rather than leveling up your characters, you now unlock new difficulties by completing missions. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next difficulty. The studio believes it will motivate new players to master the game step by step and give veteran players confidence that their teammates have earned their place.</p>
<p>There's also a new Inferno in-game event running until July 7, and a new Havoc campaign. Lastly, the maximum number of Operatives was increased to 8, and the maximum number of weapon loadouts received the same treatment. Players will also hear around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
