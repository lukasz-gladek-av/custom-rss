			<p>In 2021, seven developers from Gearbox, Bethesda, and Epic Games decided to team up and take a huge risk by creating a brand new game studio called Ruckus Games. Since they created the studio, it has been fairly quiet. Today,&nbsp; they've unveiled some sneak peeks into their upcoming debut title, and those who are interested are being given the opportunity to playtest the game and help the team. This title is being led by CEO and Game Director Paul Sage, who was the previous Creative Director of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-borderlands-3-post-launch-interview/">Borderlands 3</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>Already, Ruckus Games has quite a huge potential, as there are industry giants from Gearbox, Riot Games, Blizzard, and many more. Each founding member of Ruckus Games brings essential know-how to create a multiplayer game that is set to stand out from the crowd and draw in the audience.</p>
<p>When pitching to investors, Ruckus Games managed to sell their prototype to investors rather quickly, receiving $19 million in funding to help bring their multiplayer vision to life. The investors (who are not mentioned by name) were sold on the premiere project after playing just 20 minutes of a demo. Considering that when this happened, the studio was brand-new, and the prototype was made in 12 months, it's quite an impressive feat and is bound to leave people curious about what they could possibly have in store for those who may playtest the game.</p>
<p>At the moment, the title of Ruckus' project hasn't been announced. The title will be up to four-player co-op, with the world continuing to evolve and receive new content over time. The game takes place in a "reminiscent era amid the backdrop of the American heartland," where players are just ordinary people who are forced to try and become heroes when the town starts to get attacked. The game will feature a large roster of playable characters, with lots of weapon combinations that are wacky and fun to pull the audience in.</p>
<p>These weapon combos include a toaster that can shoot saw blades or a powerwasher-turned flamethrower. As you explore and unlock new items, you can cause as much havoc as you like, rescue NPCs, and go back to your Hometown, where you can customize, build, and upgrade your living area, which will then give you the option to upgrade your weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>"We want games where people have fun from the get-go. Games that are physical, joyous, and just a damn good time to be shared with others. We can't wait to show you what we have in store," says Game Director and Ruckus Games CEO Paul Sage.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in seeing what Ruckus Games has on offer, you are encouraged to sign-up to participate in the playtest on their <a href="https://www.ruckus-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>

			<p>Avowed wasn't delayed to 2025 because the game was in bad shape but due to the "avalanche" of games releasing in the final few months of 2024, according to Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, the Xbox head talked about the next role-playing game by Obsidian Entertainment and its delay, saying that it wasn't delayed because it was in bad shape and the developer needed more time to work on the game but because there was an avalanche of games scheduled to release in the final few months of the year. Postponing a game was something that Microsoft could afford since they had the Diablo IV expansion Vessel of Hatred, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Obsidian will also make sure of this extra time they got but did not need in any capacity.</p>
<p>It has been some time since we have seen Avowed in action. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/">A few months back</a>, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden talked about some of the less talked-about mechanics, such as the radial wheel that allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they want to do. The full gameplay demo from a few months back also provided another look at other gameplay mechanics and three different archetypes and at how Obsidian used the Pillars of Eternity world to present a slightly different RPG experience than what the franchise has presented to date.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th worldwide.</p>
