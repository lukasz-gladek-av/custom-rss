However, things have <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">changed a lot</strong> since the game's release, and with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Microsoft's multiplatform pivot</strong>, it's only a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/"><strong>matter of time until every previous Xbox console exclusive hits PlayStation 5.</strong></a> </p>



<p>Now, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/"><strong>rumored</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">internal delay into 2026</strong></a>, it seems like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the wait</strong> for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> to land on Sony's current-generation console is reportedly<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> close to an end</strong>.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, Polish publication <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PPE</strong></a> revealed that the open-world RPG will launch on PlayStation 5 consoles in around two months, on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">April 7</strong>. The game will launch with a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Standard Edition</strong> and a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Premium Edition</strong>, whose additional content has yet to be revealed, but could include both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong><em>Shattered Space</em> expansion</strong></a> and the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-dlc-tease-bethesda-terran-armada-2026/"><strong>second expansion.</strong></a></p>



<p>Although this source scored a miss with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-digital-only-launch/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> not receiving a retail edition at launch</a></strong> rumor, it proved to be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extremely reliable</strong> in regards to release dates of Xbox-published games on PlayStation 5, such as with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Flight Simulator 2024</em> last year</strong></a>, so there's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a high chance</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> will indeed land on Sony's system in two months.</p>



<p>The imminent release of the game on PlayStation 5 is an interesting happening even for those who already played Starfield on Xbox Series X|S and PC, as this launch is rumored to coincide with the release a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/">massive update</a></strong> which will bring significant improvements to the game, addressing some of the most common complaints, such as <strong>loading screens</strong> that essentially fracture the game's open world, <strong>improved space flight</strong> and more. </p>



<p>Will such an update be enough to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">change the perception of the game, </strong>which Skyrim's design lead Bruce Nesmith believes would have been <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/">different if a studio other than Bethesda had made i</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/">t</a></strong>? Hopefully, it won't take long to find out.</p>
