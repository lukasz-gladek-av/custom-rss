			<p>Publisher A Plus and developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology have announced that Blue Protocol: Star Resonance will arrive on PC, iOS, and Android this coming October 2025. Pre-registration for mobile players also kicks off today, as well as the closed beta test for participants on PC.</p>



<p>If you're looking to play Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on mobile, then you can pre-register for the game on its <a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">official website</a>. If you'd rather check it out on PC, then instead of just waiting for its October launch, you can jump into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/">closed beta test through Steam</a> starting today. If you missed the chance to sign up for the beta test, A Plus has confirmed that it will "<em>continuously release codes depending on the server capacity after the test begins</em>."</p>

<p>Star Resonance marks the return of the MMORPG after the original Blue Protocol release, which first arrived in Japan in 2023, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down a year later,</a> and had its release outside of Japan cancelled. It officially shut down this past January, with the reason for its closure simply being that it was unable to garner enough of a player base to keep going.</p>



<p>If you're happy to see it return and are looking forward to its October launch, beyond the closed beta test, A Plus has confirmed that attendees at the Anime NYC convention will be able to check out a playable demo of the game.</p>

			<p>What do Hollow Knight Silksong and Grand Theft Auto VI have in common? Enough popularity to make other studios delay their games to get out of the way, and hopefully not be drowned out by the hype of either. Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Team Cherry finally announced a release date</a> for Silksong, which will launch on September 4, 2025. Today, developers Aeternum Game Studios and Panik Arcade delayed their games to get the hell out of its way.</p>



<p>Both studios cite Hollow Knight Silksong's release date as a reason for their delay, though in fairness the situations for Aeternum and Panik are not exactly one-to-one. In the case of Panik Arcade and its slot machine roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a>, that takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, is only being delayed by a few weeks, from its initial September 3 release date to September 26.</p>



<p>The studio announced the delay with a <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, and added in a press release, "<em>We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol</em>. <em>We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we‚Äôre launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üö®GAME DELAY üö®</p><p>due to Silksong (can‚Äôt wait to play) launching just a day after CloverPit, we decided to delay our release</p><p>our new release date is 26th Sept</p><p>we poured our hearts into our little game, so we want to give it the best possible shot. thanks for understanding!! <a href="https://t.co/QwKwBrBuFJ">pic.twitter.com/QwKwBrBuFJ</a></p></div>‚Äî Panik Arcade üïπÔ∏è making CloverPit üçíüé∞ (@PanikArcade) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>At least in CloverPit's case, Panik Arcade is just trying to ensure that it can grab some attention when it launches, especially since it's a very different game compared to Silksong, and isn't trying to stand its ground as a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Which is the problem that Aeternum Game Studios is dealing with. Its upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, is a sequel to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/">2021's Aeterna Noctis</a> and a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>"<em>Our initial plan was to launch it this September,</em>" Aeternum Game Studios writes in a <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>But after the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Aeterna Lucis won't arrive until sometime in 2026. Though Aeternum Game Studios isn't just pinning the blame on Hollow Knight Silksong. It needs more than just a few weeks of delay time because it doesn't have "<em>all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you Aeterna Lucis at the right time. That's why we've made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio doesn't specify which of the next-generation platforms it is struggling to obtain development kits for, but the obvious guess is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as we've seen several reports about smaller studios having issues getting dev kits from Nintendo, with only the larger studios and publishers getting priority.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Aeternum Game Studios goes on to thank Team Cherry, crediting the studio and Hollow Knight as a key reason for 2D Metroidvania games being as popular as they are in the modern gaming landscape. The studio also acknowledges Team Cherry's work as a key inspiration for Aeterna Noctis and Aeterna Lucis.</p>



<p>At least in the case of Grand Theft Auto VI's release date, studios have more time to plan to get out of Rockstar and Take-Two's path, since you can bet that GTA VI will hog <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/">every bit of the videogame industry's attention</a> when it arrives in May 2026.</p>
