			<p>If you are a fan of the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, you are well aware of how <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is <strong>struggling</strong> in more ways than one. Launched successfully in late February 2025, the game's <strong>low challenge level</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> prevented it from capitalizing on its launch momentum.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">Title Updates</a></strong> released last year <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">addressed the low challenge level</a></strong> of the experience, this wasn't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enough</strong> for many fans of the series, who <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returned to previous entries in the series</strong> such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter World</em> to get their hunting fix.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>producer Yuya Tokuda pleaded with lapsed players to return</strong></a>, but it seems the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation</strong> and the <strong>performance issues that still persist</strong> are not only keeping players away, but are <strong>deterring new ones</strong> as well.</p>



<p>Earlier today, CAPCOM shared <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf"><strong>a list of its best-selling games</strong></a> for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. While <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/"><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></a>,</em> and the <em>Resident Evil</em> series <strong>enjoyed strong sales</strong>, the same cannot be said of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>



<p>The latest entry in the series sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">354,000 units</strong> in the third quarter, as opposed to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">453,000 units of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> and the 431,000 units of its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sunbreak</em></a> expansion</strong>. This difference in units sold (which may have been helped by the deep discounts of the older games offered during the holiday period), and its status as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">publisher's worst-selling game in the quarter</strong>, further highlight the struggle <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is facing, and can't seem to overcome.</p>



<p><span><em>"Rise selling more than Wilds is pretty damning,"</em>&nbsp;commented <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-q3-fy2025-best-selling-games-re4-1-08m-re-village-717k-sf6-600k-re2-529k-mh-rise-453k-mh-wilds-354k.1417129/post-150569974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetERA forums member Gilo</a></strong>, a sentiment that describes well a&nbsp;<strong>baffling and unexpected situation,</strong>&nbsp;a</span>nd that reflects how the gaming community is reacting to <strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' low sales.</strong></p>



<p>At this point, besides the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">promised performance improvements</strong> (which will hopefully also address a<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">huge technical issue discovered earlier this month</strong></a>), the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Master Rank expansion</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/">datamined Nintendo Switch 2 port</a></strong> are the last chances CAPCOM has to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">turn the perception</strong> of a game which, in my opinion, even with its flaws, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>a solid entry in the series</strong></a> that maybe needed some more time in the oven to meet every fans' expectations.</p>

			<p>Throughout the marketing phase of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> kept quiet about a few things. One was famously <strong>the presence of Leon Kennedy as a playable character</strong>, which leaker Dusk Golem swore about for a long time but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained unconfirmed until last month</a>. </p>



<p>Another was <strong>the zombies</strong>, the key enemy in the whole series. How would they look? What would they behave like? It was only recently that the developers finally opened up about this. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-are-unpredictable-in-ways-the-series-hasnt-tried-before/1100-6537627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a fresh interview with Gamespot</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi unveiled the twist: to make them more unpredictable, CAPCOM <strong>has ensured they retain some of their human behavior</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When making a Resident Evil title, the question of how to present zombies is always something that comes up in discussions. You want to have some variety, but at the same time, if you make too many changes, it doesn't feel like a zombie anymore, so there's always that element or that challenge of designing enemies for a Resident Evil title. In this setting, you're dealing with a lot of zombies who literally just became zombies momentarily or a while ago. It's pretty fresh.</em></p>



<p><em>Part of that fear experience is not knowing what the enemy is going to do when they approach you or when you see them, and so if you just had a standard zombie, you probably by now have an idea of what a zombie's going to do. But if you had these zombies here that retained some of their memories or behavior from their previous life, then there's more of a mystery element. You're not exactly sure what they're going to do.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly an interesting concept. Over the course of the series, zombies did become a bit trite and less scary than they were at first. Will this change in Resident Evil Requiem be enough to make players fear them once again? We'll know in a month when the game will be released across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>
