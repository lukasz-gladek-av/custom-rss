			<p>The PS5 Pro seems way more capable of handling the demanding Unreal Engine 5 than the base model, as the system runs the demo that first showed what sort of visuals the engine can deliver much better than any other console currently on the market.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycu1</a>, The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo runs considerably better on the newly released system than on the base system without a dedicated patch that would allow the demo to take full advantage of the PS5 Pro's power and features. Resolution changing to keep performance steady is rather noticeable in some sequences, but it is still impressive how the console handles this demanding demo, which uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5 that lacks many of the improvements that have been introduced over the years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Matrix Awakens - Can PS5 Pro handle this Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKnW095Kpys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be quite interesting to see how the PS5 Pro would run The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo if it were updated to the latest version of the engine. As showcased in a video <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/">last month</a>, the improvements introduced to the engine since its very first version make quite a difference in terms of image quality and performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the mid-generation refresh system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, MachineGames has <a href="https://youtu.be/ik6WEckZKh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>a new deep dive video for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. In the footage, Audio Director Pete Ward claimed that the game will make exploration feel truly rewarding, especially for those players who like to wander off.</p>
<p><em>The game is designed around the charm and resourcefulness of our hero. You will be thrown into this story-driven&nbsp;journey where Indiana must hunt for clues to uncover the Great Circle's mysteries. This race for answers will take you to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The focus for this game is adventure. When you venture into the unknown we want exploration to feel truly rewarding. We carefully crafted each environment to encourage players to uncover clues left, discover valuable objects, and reveal hidden secrets that can aid you in your adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>While the vividly recreated locations you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, you'll always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets hiding around every corner. Open areas give you the freedom to find your own adventures beautiful. In these areas, let your curiosity take you off the main path and uncover new missions and mysteries.</em></p>
<p>As an adventure game first and foremost said to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by 1992's classic point-and-click game Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will also place a significant emphasis on puzzles.</p>
<p><em>During your adventure, Indiana's versatile tools are at your disposal. It's up to you to find clever uses for each of them. That includes Indiana's camera. Snap photos to reveal historical insights and important clues. Or if you feel the need, use it to receive puzzle hints.</em></p>
<p><em>The journal is your complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of your journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where you've been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</em></p>
<p><em>Indiana's greatest tool is his mind. Just like Indie, you'll use yours to navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few of the things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle is designed to fit seamlessly into the world. They range from smaller challenges hiding forbidden secrets to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries. Solving these puzzles will make you feel like the world's greatest archaeologist.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PlayStation 5 version is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared</a> for Spring 2025. Meanwhile, check out our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> from a press event.</p>
