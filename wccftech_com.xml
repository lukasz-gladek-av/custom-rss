			<p>A team of modders is working on Bully Online, a modification for the PC version of Bully: Scholarship Edition that promises to allow players to roam the grounds of Bullworth Academy and the nearby town with their friends. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Scholarship Edition did have a multiplayer mode, but it was limited to two players and only allowed them to face off in the class minigames. </p>



<p>According to community creator SWEGTA, Bully Online promises much more, including free roam support, solo and group minigames, and even a role-playing system. They were able to add a 'fully fleshed out inventory system' so that players can earn money through side objectives, minigames, or item finding/trading. Money can be spent on houses, weapons, vehicles, and various items. When purchasing a vehicle, the player will receive unique car keys, allowing them to lock vehicles so others cannot steal them.</p>



<p>There will also be some new minigames, such as Rat Wars, a team shooter mode where oversized cartoon rats wield guns, as well as racing, which includes custom vehicles and tracks. These minigames will be instanced, avoiding potential issues with griefing or mode conflicts. </p>



<p>In case you're curious, this online mod is made possible by the DSL script loader plugin, allowing the team to introduce features like server connectivity and custom scripting.</p>

<p>The current plan is to open the private official server to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-Fi support</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">rs</a> starting in December. Besides early access, supporting the modding team also provides the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Developer updates: videos, screenshots, behind-the-scenes commentary</li>



<li>Custom name tag colors (blue for supporters, red for admins)</li>



<li>An in-game digital camera (10 photo slots, shareable with other players)</li>



<li>Priority access to join when the servers are full</li>



<li>Discord role and private chat to communicate with the dev team</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to eventually release Bully Online to the public after an early access period. However, the big question is whether the project will even reach that phase. We've seen Rockstar shutting down modding projects before, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty City Preservation Project</a>, which attempted to recreate GTA IV inside the GTA V engine.</p>



<p>As for Bully itself, we know that Rockstar started working on a sequel that was, however, eventually canceled. Dan Houser recently claimed that it was due a lack of 'bandwidth'.</p>

			<p>This morning, indie Chinese developer ChillyRoom unveiled Loulan: The Cursed Sand, one of the games funded through the PlayStation China Hero Project.</p>



<p>The game is a hack 'n' slash action RPG viewed from a Diablo-like camera. The setting is the ancient Silk Road, in China's Western Regions. Loulan: The Cursed Sand tells the tragic love story of an exiled royal guard who returns to the titular fallen kingdom amidst the chaos of war in search of his beloved princess.</p>



<p>Players will step into the game as the skeletal warrior known as 'The Cursed Sand', mastering the power of sand as they explore, solve puzzles, and engage in realistic melee combat against overwhelming odds, including powerful enemies. There's no release date yet, but the game will be released for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3833280/Loulan_The_Cursed_Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/loulan-the-cursed-sand-60d275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and, of course, PlayStation 5.</p>
