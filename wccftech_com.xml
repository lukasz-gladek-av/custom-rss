			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has just reported its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">third-quarter financial results</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, which covers the last three months of 2025, ending right at the end of the year on December 31, 2025. This is an important distinction to make, only because these results do not include all of the layoffs and restructuring that happened at the start of this year when the company announced its "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>This means that Ubisoft went forward with its plan to reorganize the entire structure of the company and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">layoff hundreds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">workers across</a> multiple of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">its global branches</a> and its own <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">headquarters in Paris</a> while the company was actually doing well on paper. The company reported <strong>double-digit growth</strong> in the quarter, with net bookings coming in at <strong>€338 million,</strong> a <strong>12% increase</strong> from the third quarter of its previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>It was the "<em>overperformance</em>" of the <strong>Assassin's Creed </strong>franchise that drove the increase, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-hands-on/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong> and <strong>The Division</strong> helping push the increase behind it. Its new historical sim, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></strong>, was able to deliver net bookings that outpaced its predecessor, <strong>Anno 1800</strong>. Though its only major live service title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/">Rainbow Six Siege</a></strong>, did not exceed or fall below expectations, it simply landed where Ubisoft thought it would, which Ubisoft partially attributes to a "<em>particularly crowded</em>" first-person shooter market.</p>



<p>"<em>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations</em>," said Ubisoft chief executive officer and the guy who recently installed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">his son in one of the company's highest-ranking positions</a>, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>. "<em>This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players</em>."</p>



<p>Guillemot went on to say that the company is "<em>making progress on the transformation announced in January</em>," with key positions within the new structure still being filled, with some of the roles set to be filled by <em>"external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans</em>." Which sounds exactly like <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">the kinds of people they lost</a> in this restructuring, either through layoffs or <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">individuals looking towards greener pastures</a>.</p>



<p>The one bit of forward-looking news we got was that the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/">The Division Resurgence</a></strong> is set to be revealed "<em>soon</em>," according to the report, with no mention of the long-rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></strong> remake/remaster, or anything else coming up from the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

			<p><span>Earlier today,&nbsp;<strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>&nbsp;published its Q4 2025 earnings report, and in the <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss2025Q4_eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent earnings call</a>, the South Korean company revealed interesting tidbits about what it will focus on after the imminent launch of&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Desert</strong>.</span> The executives revealed that, depending on market demand (that is to say, depending on how well the game sells), Pearl Abyss <strong>already has plans to potentially add downloadable content and even multiplayer</strong>.</p>



<p>As you probably remember, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually supposed to be an MMO at first</a></strong>. Then it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an open world game with multiplayer elements</a>, but in the last few years, Pearl Abyss hasn't referred to multiplayer at all. It seems like <strong>they haven't entirely abandoned the plans to add multiplayer modes</strong>; rather, they focused on completing the single player experience first.</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss also explained why Crimson Desert took much longer than anticipated. The reason is the concurrent development of the BlackSpace Engine, but they are now confident that, with the technology ready, they'll be able to accelerate work on the next games, the open world creature collecting game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dokev-an-open-world-creature-collecting-game-by-pearl-abyss-resurfaces-with-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DokeV</a></strong> and the exosuit shooter game <strong>Plan 8</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Since we have reached the stabilization stage of the BlackSpace Engine, we now have an environment where, from the next title DokeV, we can concentrate our efforts on just developing the game alone. Accordingly, we believe that we will have a great reduction in the development time of different projects. In addition, through the development of Crimson Desert, we have now accumulated significant internal experience and know-how regarding Console. So we believe that by efficiently managing development and other preparatory work, we will have a smaller launch gap between new titles.</em></p>



<p>DokeV in particular already <strong>garnered attention</strong> thanks to the Gamescom 2021 trailer. Pearl Abyss acknowledged that fans have been left without any updates, but clarified that Crimson Desert remains the focus, which is why they couldn't share any news about that game. Now, <strong>they believe it should take about two years after the debut of Crimson Desert to launch it</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Considering the launch preparation experience of Crimson Desert, taking into account that at least one year or so of preparation for launching was needed even after game completion, it seems about 2 years of time will be needed after the launch of Crimson Desert for DokeV. </em></p>



<p>The good news is that some sort of communication about DokeV should start later this year. We'll let you know once that happens. In other Crimson Desert news, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared more information about the game's non-combat activities</a></strong>.</p>
