			<p>To celebrate the <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>, which lands in exactly one week, game developer <strong>Game Science</strong> has released six minutes of in-game footage from the upcoming game <strong>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</strong>, a follow-up to the massively successful <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a></strong>. The content doesn't actually include anything that will be in the game itself; it's been crafted just for the celebration. However, it provides an early look at the visual upgrades that we'll see in the upcoming title.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong quickly became a sensation after its launch in August 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to the second spot of Steam's all-time concurrent player chart</a>, where it still sits today. In September, <strong>it had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 18 million units sold</a></strong>, and an expansion was supposed to be underway. However, the studio eventually ditched that plan in favor of fast-tracking a new game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> a few months ago to be titled Black Myth: Zhong Kui.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>That said, in an FAQ published on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, Game Science <strong>clarified that this isn't a direct sequel to Wukong</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design. Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui shares the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore. In terms of genre, it will remain a standard single-player ARPG, following the same business model as before. However, you won't be playing a monkey role this time. That said, we're still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui.</em></p>



<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui is currently in development for PC and consoles. Given that Wukong is still relatively new, <strong>we may have to wait 3 to 4 years before we can play this new title</strong>. Indeed, the FAQ still says the developer hasn't even finished the outline yet. Best get ready for a long wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remedy Announces New CEO, Says CONTROL Resonant’s Reception Was Excellent: “It’s Our Most Ambitious Game, We Want to Make It a Must-Have”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> announced its new CEO. As you may remember, the previous Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Tero Virtala</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left in late October</a> after nine years in the studio following the <strong>financial disaster</strong> that was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a></strong>. The game, Remedy's first online multiplayer release, utterly failed to deliver a fun, replayable experience, a basic requirement for any successful online multiplayer game.</p>



<p>The newly appointed CEO is <strong>Jean-Charles Gaudechon</strong>. He has over twenty years of experience in the industry, including senior leadership roles at <strong>CCP Games</strong> and <strong>Electronic Arts</strong>, although recently he was a Senior Vice President and General/Group Manager for sports app OneFootball and fantasy sports platform Sleeper.</p>



<p>Gaudechon shared a brief comment to comment the news:</p>



<p><em>I’m excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time. The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry’s future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I’m incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio.</em></p>



<p>This morning, the developer posted its final quarter and full-year financial results, and they're quite positive. In Q4 2025, revenue increased by 46.3% to <strong>€17.0 million</strong> (compared to <strong>€11.7 million</strong> in Q4 2024), driven primarily by <strong>Alan Wake 2</strong> royalties and <strong>Control</strong> game sales. For the full year, revenue increased by 17.5% to <strong>€59.5 million</strong> (up from 2024's <strong>€50.7 million</strong>); operating profit was actually negative at <strong>-14.9 million</strong>, but that's only because of the non-cash impairment caused by the aforementioned FBC: Firebreak. Operating cash flow remained positive at <strong>€4.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Current interim CEO <strong>Markus Mäki</strong> (who will stay in the role until March 1, when Gaudechon officially takes over) clarified that Control sales <strong>reached 1 million in 2025 alone</strong>, most of which came after the announcement of the sequel, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, whose early reception was reportedly excellent:</p>



<p><em>Player and community sentiment has been very positive, indicated by engaged fans and positive wishlist numbers. <strong>Our goal is to make the game a 'must-have day-one purchase' for the fans of&nbsp;Control&nbsp;and the action role-playing genre</strong>. The announcement at The Game Awards in December was a great kickstart to the ambitious global marketing campaign we have planned for&nbsp;CONTROL Resonant.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, CONTROL Resonant is slated to launch this year, though it has no specific launch window yet. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Lays Off Close to Half of the 2XKO Team as the Game’s “Overall Momentum” Falls Short]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Riot</strong> has announced that the <strong>2XKO </strong>team, which just celebrated launching the new <strong>League of Legends-</strong>based 2v2 tag fighter out of early access less than a month ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">January 20</a>,</strong> will lose <strong>80 members of its development team</strong> in a round of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoffs</a></strong>. The news was confirmed in a blog post from the game's executive producer, <strong><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">Tom Cannon</a></strong>, who cited that despite the game doing well with its "<em>core audience</em>," the "<em>overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>While the statement itself doesn't cite the exact number of developers who were laid off, a report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> adds that a Riot spokesperson confirmed that approximately 80, which rounds out to approximately half of the game's initial development team, are losing their jobs.</p>



<p>"<em>As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO</em>," Cannon explained. "<em>The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</em>"</p>



<p>Cannon added that the plans for the upcoming 2026 Competitive Series remain "<em>unchanged</em>," and that this decision is a "<em>reshaping</em>" of the team, "<em>to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward</em>." Cannon also noted that the decision is not a reflection on any individual member of the development team, and that Riot is doing what it can to help the impacted developers.</p>



<p>Cannon concluded, "<em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</em> <em>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community</em>."</p>



<p>At the top of the year, 2XKO was one of Wccftech's<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/"> Most Anticipated Fighting Games of 2026</a>. Before that, even in its early access state, it made our list for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Best Fighting Games of 2025</a>. It's a bold fighting game with a strong aesthetic that gives players a fresh introduction to the League of Legends franchise and its characters that have lasted for so long.</p>



<p>This is the latest layoff in the video game industry, after January was already riddled with layoffs from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>
