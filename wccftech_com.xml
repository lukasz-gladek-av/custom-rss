			<p>Samsung announced its highly anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup last month, which comes with more or less the same design, but the internals have been improved a lot. The raw computational and graphical performance is far superior to the company's Galaxy S24 lineup, and it will make a lot of difference if you are into mobile gaming. A new comparison test was conducted between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the gaming performance reflects which device is better at running Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Max roasts the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact with a solid 95 FPS average compared to the latter's 60 FPS</h2>
<p>The App Store and Play Store offer a wide range of high-end games that make the right use of the chips in the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new comparison test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DameTech">Dame Tech on YouTube</a> highlights the performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. The test will detail the FPS of both games, along with performance throttling and power usage on the flagship smartphones and how they compare against each other.</p>
<p>One important aspect to note at this point is that the iPhone has been the top-performing gaming device. Dame Tech mentions that despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra's exclusive high-resolution settings for games, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a better in-game resolution. We also have to take note that the Snapdragon 8 Elite's <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-for-galaxy-s25-is-faster/">exclusive chip</a> has better performance on paper, and it is reflected in the overall performance of both Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the comparison video below, the game settings were set to maximum, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra maintains a solid 59.2 FPS across Wuthering Waves with minor ups and downs. Additionally, the game plays smoothly with no stutter whatsoever, which goes on to show that Snapdragon's exclusive chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra is pushing performance on par with the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, which scored 59 FPS.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider the higher power draw for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, taking in as much as 7.2 Watts against 5.4 Watts on the iPhone. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was played at a higher 1705 x 786 resolution compared to the Galaxy. Moreover, the test also revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro Max maintained almost the same level of frame rates while running more than 10 degrees cooler than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It clearly shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-performance-cores-overclocked-can-beat-a18-pro-in-single-score-benchmark/">A18 Pro chip</a> is handling the high-end game quite easily compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the iPhone 16 Pro Max crushes the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact on the highest settings, maintaining 95.2 FPS on average and reaching as high as 120 FPS on several occasions at a higher resolution. The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be running at a steady 60 FPS, likely due to a frame rate cap implemented by the game developers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also ran a few degrees cooler.</p>

<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max performed better, Samsung has finally introduced a device that can compete against the iPhone. In addition, it is possibly the best gaming smartphone when it comes to competition from Android. We will share more details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its performance, so do stay tuned.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be fully backward compatible with Switch titles. However, fans have been wondering for how long Nintendo would continue to release games for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the subject in the company's usual post-quarterly earnings <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A with investors</a>. The executive said that more original Switch games will be made, but at the same time, he highlighted the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p><em>We have already announced Pok√©mon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond for Nintendo Switch in 2025. We will continue developing Nintendo Switch titles, but launching exclusive games for Nintendo Switch 2 is essential for its success. However, we aim to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms.</em></p>
<p>This tells us that it may not be long before we get the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, as Nintendo has a vested interest in getting users to transition from one generation to another. Besides, the original Switch is clearly on a downward trajectory for its sales, as evidenced even in the last quarter during which 'only' 4.82 million units were sold. Still, it was enough to allow the hybrid console to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break the big 150 million sales milestone</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party may leave behind the original Nintendo Switch even quicker. Since they already largely switched from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X as the default targets for new games, it won't make much sense for them to spend time trying to make more complex titles fit the aging Switch hardware when there's a new platform with support for technologies like NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Nintendo Switch 2 is slated to launch later this year. Between April and June, hands-on events will take place worldwide; before that, on April 2, Nintendo will unveil many more details about the new console. So far, analysts have <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to the brief teaser trailer shared in January.</p>
