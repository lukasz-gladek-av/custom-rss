			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is unlikely to use the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering like Oblivion Remastered does, as it would do little to address some of the most common Creation Engine complaints, like the fragmented game world.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry responded to a fan's question about whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a test for the next entry in the series. They highlighted the possibility is definitely there, as other studios have done something similar in the past, essentially making Unreal Engine their own, like Housemarque with Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it seems unlikely that The Elder Scrolls VI will use Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, as the Epic engine would not solve any of the most significant issues of the Creation Engine by itself. As highlighted by Oblivion Remastered, the Unreal Engine 5 was still limited by the Gamebryo engine powering the rest of the game, and the game world was still as fragmented as it was in the original. At the same time, rendering was not exactly an issue in Starfield, and with the Creation Engine likely getting rendering improvements for The Elder Scrolls VI, having Unreal Engine 5 rendering would only serve to delay the game further, complicate development and potentially add performance issues, as Oblivion Remastered is extremely heavy and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">runs poorly on pretty much everything that isn't a top end machine with frame generation on top.</a></p>

<p>With The Elder Scrolls VI still far from release, the launch of Oblivion Remastered allows players to return to Tamriel ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series. Despite performance issues and some visual changes, the remaster is a game worth experiencing, keeping the original's magic intact, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>. The game is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI doesn't need another trailer to get people excited about the game. On the contrary, the element of surprise would make its launch an even bigger success, according to a former Rockstar Games developer.</p>
<p>As part of a social media celebration of the 17th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto IV, which includes some interesting insights on the lead platform, which was the Xbox 360 due to how difficult it was to develop on PlayStation 3, and how the decision to delay the game to April 29th, 2008 was made four months before the original October 16th 2007 release date, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij commented on how they would handle Grand Theft Auto VI marketing cycle, saying that, if it were their call to make, they wouldn't release any additional trailer. There's already plenty of excitement for the game's release, and the element of surprise would make the release bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also:<br>
If it was my call I wouldn’t release any additional trailers.<br>
There is more than enough hype around VI and the element of surprise is going to make the release only bigger as an event.</p>
<p>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1917025732074655981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After releasing the game's announcement trailer in late 2023, Rockstar Games hasn't talked much about Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite the silence on the game, however, Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">reiterated</a> back in February that the game is still scheduled to release this Fall to contribute, together with Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, to what is shaping up one of the strongest ever for the publisher, though it could have been even stronger if the game launched on PC at the same time as console.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen much of Grand Theft Auto VI in action, the recent release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition</a> on PC allowed us to get some sort of preview of the tech that will power the visuals of the next entry in the series. From some tests, however, it's clear how the game will likely target 30 FPS on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as CPUs on par with those powering the current generation of consoles struggle to handle the game properly at above 30 frames per second.</p>

			<p>Japanese developer PlatinumGames went through a rough patch with the launch of Babylon's Fall. The game published by Square Enix was the studio's first attempt at a live service title and it failed spectacularly, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite a potentially intriguing setting, the execution was severely lacking, leading to poor critic reviews and <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-reaches-zero-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely low player numbers</a>. Francesco De Meo opined that a lot of the problems <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-babylons-fall-truly-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do with monetization</a>:</p>
<p><em>Where the monetization, Battle Passes, and GaaS features have impacted the game the most, in my opinion, is where it mattered the most in a PlatinumGames action title: combat mechanics. At the end of the main campaign, it becomes possible to change each weapon's attack mode to Power and Technical Mode, with the latter essentially making the game feel more in line with other, better games by PlatinumGames. Additional mechanics unlocked during the campaign itself, such as elemental attacks and properties and the Gideon Coffin mechanics, also make combat considerably more fun than at the start of the campaign. Later quests also feature a much better design, with different traps, light platforming, and more varied combat scenarios. Also, the endgame, although not much different in terms of game flow from the main campaign, is considerably more fun than the base campaign, and it is much easier to find players for stuff like Sieges and so on, better executing the multiplayer action game premise of the experience.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that it is clear that all these features and mechanics have been held back on purpose only to retain players and potentially make them buy future Battle Passes and premium currency. If the best-designed quests and advanced game mechanics would have been made available earlier, would the game have been received slightly better? I definitely think so. The game wouldn't have scored 7s or 8s all around, no question about it, but more reasonable 5s and 6s.</em></p>
<p>Babylon's Fall live servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went down for good</a> on February 27, 2023, less than a year after the game's launch. However, the Japanese developer still plans to work in the live service genre. As first <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/platinumgames-new-online-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by TechGamers</a>, they are <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/platinumgames/jobs/1-01-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> a Game Designer whose desired skills must include 'Experience working on online action game development' and 'Experience in level design for online or open field games'. Of course, it is possible that the studio would use Babylon's Fall learnings to make a much better live service product this time. At this stage, it is unclear whether this will be self-published or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on the single player action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which will be released later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>
