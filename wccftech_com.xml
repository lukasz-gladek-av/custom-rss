<p>The love the modding community is pouring into the game - releasing mods that significantly improve the experience with enhanced visuals, such as the <strong>HD Reworked Project</strong>, whose <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hdrp-nextgen-edition-2026-wind-simulation-more-detailed-characters/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version is set to launch this year</strong></a>, along with new features - is also behind its enduring popularity. The first new feature this community added to the game this year is something unexpected that is sure to bring more than a few players to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Continent</strong>: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a multiplayer mode.</strong></p>



<p>Developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">rejuvenate</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher Online</em></strong> adds a new multiplayer mode which allows users to experience the world of the game together with others by connecting to dedicated servers all while supporting other mods, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters</a></em></strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6402">Chill Out</a></em></strong> for enhanced role-playing, giving the game a sort of MMO feel, though in a minimal scope.</p>



<p>Besides supporting these other mods, <strong><em><a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/features">The Witcher Online</a></em></strong> features equipment sync thanks to which each players will be able to see their their equipped armor, swords, crossbow, scabbards, hair style, and face mark, full movement and combat sync corresponding to <strong>Geralt's</strong> animations, emotes that other players can see using corresponding emote commands in the console, statuses display and more.</p>



<p>Although the mod isn't perfect in its <span>current release, available from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590?tab=description" target="_blank"><strong>Nexus Mods</strong></a>, as it has issues in b</span>oss fights and more, the community is obviously excited about this great development, which was unexpected, especially&nbsp;10 years after the game's release. </p>

			<p><strong>Hazelight Studios</strong> has made a name for itself by creating excellent couch co-op games, with the team's latest release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong>, being one of 2025's best games, earning it several nominations at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a>,</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It was even one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's picks for our Best Games of 2025</a>, and according to the studio's creative director, <strong>Josef Fares</strong>, the studio's next game will be "<em>better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>This comes from a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>, where Fares talked about a lot more than just what he expects from the studio's next game. He talked about how the team at Hazelight is consistently raising its bar, which is why he added, "<em>I feel extremely confident of everything we’re doing. I can easily say that our next game is better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>That confidence comes from the culture that has been built at the studio since its debut game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Hazelight currently stands at a team of <strong>80 people</strong>, and keeping as much of that team together since its founding has been a key part of the studio's success, as they've all grown together with Josef Fares leading the charge with his "<em>F*** s*** up mentality, without f***ing up</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Split Fiction’s Josef Fares on Clair Obscur success, AI fears and EA’s reputation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9WyRvP53_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hazelight's games are known for being creatively supercharged, which Fares credits to his ability to "<em>wake up the creative monster</em>" inside the developers at Hazelight. A task easier said than done, though, as we're often the ones to get in our own way.</p>



<p>"<em>People put a lot of limitations on themselves, and it’s mainly coming from their mind</em>. <em>Once you stop listening to that, shit will start happening. And how do you do it? Well, first, you practically push that person… in a nice way, obviously. You say, ‘not this’, ‘let’s do that’. ‘that’s been done before, let’s try this way’. And eventually they come into this ‘f*** s*** up’ mentality where they’re like, ‘okay, there are no limits’. And then you make that person feel confident that there really are no limits. People have so many possibilities inside them, and that’s not only for creating games, but in general. It’s just, stop listening to this [points to head] and just feel it instead.</em>"</p>



<p>Fares also discussed how the studio has had incredible commercial successes. Split Fiction <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">sold <strong>4 million copies at launch</strong></a>, and its prior release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two</a>,</strong> sold over <strong><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies as of March 2025</a>.</strong> But those numbers weren't achieved with the studio following trends or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/">put microtransactions into everything.</a> It came from the team at Hazelight keeping what's best for the game at the heart of all its decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>Every decision, every single decision, taken by Hazelight will be based on what we feel is great for the game. We’re not going through data thinking what will sell or not sell. That’s not how we do it. I’m not saying that the business is not important. It’s important to combine them together. If you lean in too much on either side, either too much on creativity or too much on business, it’s going to be bad for the game</em>."</p>



<p>On the topic of following trends, Fares also spared a few words on the hottest topic in the industry, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?wp_searchable_posts%5Bquery%5D=genAI">GenAI</a>. </strong>"<em>We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better</em>. <em>At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?</em>"</p>
