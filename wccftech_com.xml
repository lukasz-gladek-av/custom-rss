			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 would greatly benefit from NVIDIA DLSS 4 if the console manages to run games with it at decent performance, as highlighted by a recent Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 video.</p>
<p>The new video, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandomGaminginHD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RandomGaminginHD</a>, shows the second entry in the series by Insomniac which launched last week on PC, running at 1080p upscaled from 360p base resolution by NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Ultra Performance setting on an RTX 4060 GPU, which is far from being the most powerful GPU around. While it's clear how the game is upscaled to 1080p from a very low base resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 4 not only delivers an acceptable image quality, considering the base resolution, but also very solid performance, as the game achieves an average of around 90 FPS at the highest setting without ray tracing, and a respectable 53 FPS average with Ultimate Ray Tracing. All this bodes extremely well for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is said to support NVIDIA DLSS, as this image quality would be more than acceptable on a small 1080p screen. Hopefully, the Nintendo system will be able to use the new Transformer model that powers NVIDIA DLSS 4 without a big impact on performance.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as mentioned above, launched on PC last week, but its launch was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">far from being the smoothest for PlayStation-to-PC ports</a>, as the game suffered from some critical crashing issues that prevented the vast majority of players from enjoying the game. Sony and developer Nixxes released a hotfix shortly after release to address the issue, although some are still experiencing crashes.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series from Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The first Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC patch has gone live today, introducing game stability improvements and more.</p>
<p>The 1.001 patch, which is 17.65 GB big on Steam, improves, as mentioned above, game stability by fixing several unspecified bugs. The patch also fixes the graphics preset to be set to Low when launching the game for the first time on Steam Deck, even when sava data is linked from the cloud, sets DLSS as the default option for anti-aliasing if the NVIDIA upscaler is supported by the system, and updates DirectStorage to the latest version. Sadly, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/518578271369035851?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> don't mention anything regarding performance improvements, so it may be a while until the issues that many are experiencing are addressed.</p>
<p>While Square Enix works on fixing the PC port of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is a definite step up from the Remake port, though it is still not as good as it should have been, modders are hard at work on improving the game's visuals and introducing <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">new features</a>. Several 4K texture packs have already been released to enhance<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/"> environmental</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/"> character textures</a>, while some Cheat Engine tables allow players to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sephiroth and Zack</a> to the party, who both work quite well in combat but are still far from being complete characters, as it is not yet possible to edit their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PS5 version.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign Isn’t Chasing Trends and Won’t Be Live Service, Says FromSoftware]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-isnt-chasing-trends-and-wont-be-live-service-says-fromsoftware/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware shocked most of its fans with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Elden Ring Nightreign, a standalone spin-off focused mainly on a new multiplayer experience that even includes some survival and Battle Royale elements. In an interview posted on <a href="https://fave.co/40ZkkHy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Gamer's February 2025 magazine</a> (issue 405), Game Director Junya Ishizaki (formerly a Battle Director on Elden Ring) said the goal was not to chase trends.</p>
<p><em>The focus was condensing this experience down: the RPG elements, the exploration, the character building and leveling. We wanted that to feel like it was all coming together and culminating in a boss fight, but in a more concentrated form. For this new sense of accomplishment that you wouldn’t quite find with Elden Ring or our previous titles, we felt like we needed some new mechanics and some new elements to add into that mix. We’ve never really held the stance, ‘Let’s absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends.’&nbsp;So we didn’t really see this as chasing a trend, but we saw these as interesting elements that could work well within our multiplayer focused session-based gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign hasn't been designed as a live service game, either. On this topic, Ishizaki explained:</p>
<p><em>We wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase, so everything is unlockable… it’s not what we’d consider a ‘live service’ game”. We’re still in the process of thinking about the possibilities [for post-launch content].</em></p>
<p>Players will be able to approach each session differently, according to the Game Director:</p>
<p><em>We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play. You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day. Once you’ve made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency to decide, ‘I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss’.</em></p>
<p>There's no release date for Elden Ring Nightreign yet. However, a large scale network test for console users i<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-coming-next-month-to-consoles-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s coming later this month</a> to evaluate the online systems and possibly get some feedback from testers ahead of the launch date.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character improvement texture mod</a>, here's another Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that improves the game's visuals. This time, the so-called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/198?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Fantasy mod</a> is focused on improving the environmental textures via 2x upscaling, specifically these textures (around 1300 of them):</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Trees<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Cliffs<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Rocks<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Stones<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Ground<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Grass<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Flowers<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Puddles<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The improvements are rather noticeable in the provided comparison pictures.</p>

<p>The author reported between 5% and 20% performance hit, depending on the graphics card. However, they recommend the mod only to players with 8GB+ VRAM graphics cards and NVME SSDs. Moreover, they warn that sometimes the game's texture streaming issues may well prevent the sharper textures from correctly appearing. The following tweaks to the Engine.ini file were provided to mitigate the issue:</p>
<p>r.Streaming.PoolSize=20000 (Adjust to 80% Your VRAM)<br>
r.Streaming.LimitPoolSizeToVRAM=0<br>
r.Streaming.UseFixedPoolSize=0<br>
r.Streaming.PrioritizeMeshLODRetention=1<br>
r.Streaming.SkeletalMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.StaticMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.TextureResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.UseAllMips=1<br>
r.Streaming.UseMaterialData=1<br>
r.Streaming.MaxTempMemoryAllowed=10000<br>
r.Streaming.PoolSizeForMeshes=5000</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched a few days ago on PC. So far, Steam user reviews are 'Mostly Positive' at 75% on average. The game has improved graphics features (better character models and lighting) over the PlayStation 5 version, though it lacks some common PC-specific features. For example, while it does support NVIDIA DLSS and DLAA, there's no native support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Intel XeSS.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's no frame generation, and the maximum frame rate is capped at 120 by default.&nbsp; However, there are workarounds for that, too. You can either use <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix</a>, which also lets you tweak the field of view (FoV), disable vignette, and adjust the size of subtitles, or FFVIIHook, which is an INI and dev console unlocked that lets the game read variables as with a regular Unreal Engine 4 title, allowing for greater tweaking.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, make sure to read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect score review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>.</p>
