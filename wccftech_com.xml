			<p>Despite having been released over four years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the best-looking open-world games ever released, and the latest version of the DreamPunk mod makes the game almost feel like a next-generation game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new version of the mod</a> introduces new features and improvements over its previous version, such as Dynamic Contrast and Realistic Cloud Lighting, improved weather conditions to make them look as realistic as possible, remade core LUT to allow for a higher dynamic range and more realistic sunlight and more. The new version of the mod also introduces some graphics configuration improvements to better fit NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the improved capabilities of the recently released RTX 5000 series. The end results are incredible, as showcased in the 8K resolution video below provided by NextGen Dreams.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/"> first games</a> to support the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>. The new version of the upscaler, whose release coincided with the launch of the RTX 5090 GPU back in late January, introduces plenty of improvements over the previous version, including a new Transformer model that brings significant image quality improvements. DLSS 4 also comes with an RTX 5000 series exclusive feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which brings significant performance improvements in supported titles.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One worldwide.
