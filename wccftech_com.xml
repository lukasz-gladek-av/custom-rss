			<p>Today, the Community Shaders team has released a new major update to the Skyrim graphics framework mod. Following the introduction of features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physically Based Rendering</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skylighting, and dynamic cloud shadows</a>, Community Shaders version <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.0</a> adds support (through an add-on) for AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, delivering a 60-70% performance uplift for most users. NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, which was implemented a couple of months ago, was also improved, although it remains an older version since the most recent ones do not support DirectX 11. Moreover, neither Multi Frame Generation nor Reflex are currently supported due to issues that NVIDIA should fix on their end. On the other hand, AMD Anti-Lag 2 should be supported.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the Frame Generation feature automatically optimizes Skyrim in a similar way to the extremely popular Display Tweaks mod. Therefore, Display Tweaks is not recommended to be used in conjunction, although it is still supported. The modders also note, as our readers already know very well, that frame Generation works best when your computer can already run the game at around 60 frames per second. The frame rate is then doubled to 120 frames per second, providing reliable frame pacing. Because of this, the feature only enables itself on 120Hz and higher displays, although it can still be forcefully activated from the Community Shaders panel.</p>
<p>The new Community Shaders release also brings several other improvements to Skyrim, such as a new grass shading model and improved grass collision, a parallax shading fix, mipmap LOD bias for TAA/FSR/DLAA to deliver sharper textures, the latest transformer model for DLAA, tweaks to screen space global illumination, brighter skylighting with improved shading, improved wetness effects, and various tonemapping tweaks. There will be several graphics showcases of CS 1.2.0 on YouTube in the next few days, no doubt.</p>

			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios announced the release of a new premium DLC and free update for the PC/Mac version of the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (consoles will have to wait a couple of weeks as usual).</p>
<p>The premium DLC is called Fallen Banners and introduces two new dungeons to the game: Lep Seclusa and Exiled Redoubt. In Lep Seclusa, the Moth Priests who inhabit the location are under siege, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is determined to seize the power of the Elder Scroll they guard. The Elder Scrolls Online players must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary from an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the scroll's power to change the face of Cyrodiil forever.</p>
<p>In Exiled Redoubt, soldiers of the Alliance War (regardless of their faction) are disappearing, and all traces lead to the namesake Imperial fortress. In this case, players will team up with Battlemage Lucilla to infiltrate this mysterious stronghold and put an end to the plans of a once noble Imperial House before the chaos spreads beyond its stone walls and across Tamriel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players who succeed in emerging victorious Lep Seclusa and the Exile Redoubt will also have the chance to loot and unlock a host of special rewards, including new collectibles, item sets, and Achievements. These include the Tactician's Gold Grate Skin, which can be earned by completing both dungeons on Veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Fallen Banners is currently available to active ESO Plus subscribers. However, there's also a free update, the game's 45th. ZeniMax Online Studios has introduced a visual overhaul to the Starter Zones (Bleakrock Isle, Bal Foyen, Stros M'kai, Betnikh, and Khenarthi's Roost), including improved lighting, improved ground and water textures, updated structures, and the addition of more clutter or props.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Update 45 adds much more, though, between various balance changes, the first stages of console add-on support (which is scheduled to go live in its entirety later this year), and new player response options when talking to story NPCs, in an effort to improve the roleplaying factor in dialogue. For the full patch notes, head over <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/674341/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-3-5-update-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, earlier this year, ZeniMax <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls Online would switch from yearly Chapters to seasonal content. The studio has already scheduled an ESO Direct for April 10 where more information about what's coming this year will be unveiled.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's Xbox next-generation plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld that will reportedly launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">WindowsCentral</a>, it has been revealed that the internal successor to the Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit. As of now, Xbox next generation hardware plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X console that will launch in 2027, alongside a gaming handheld and multiple new controller options which will have direct-to-cloud connectivity and allow users to switch them between different devices. As previously rumored, next-generation consoles will be closer to PCs than ever before and will make it much easier for developers to port games from PC. Backward compatibility will also be available.</p>
<p>While the handheld system that will be part of Xbox next generation plans is still two years away from release, we will get a first taste of a portable experience later this year with an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Keenan that is in the works with a PC gaming OEM. This handheld, according to WindowsCentral's report, will look markedly Xbox with the typical guide button and design sensibilities, and will likely run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as one of its main focuses.</p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft started releasing their former exclusives to other consoles, many have wondered if there are real Xbox next-generation plans. Judging from this report, it definitely looks like the company is not going to leave the hardware market anytime soon. If the new systems will indeed launch in 2027, it won't take long to see how they will deliver the largest technical leap <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">teased</a> a while back.</p>
