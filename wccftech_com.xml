<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> launched in a <strong>rough state</strong> last year, with performance issues across the board that made it difficult for many to enjoy the latest entry in the series. Following multiple updates, however, <strong>the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">game is in a much better state</a></strong>, especially on PC, and runs way more smoothly on a bigger number of system configurations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, <strong>the development team is not yet done improving the technical state of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, as tomorrow's update will introduce additional <strong>CPU and GPU optimizations</strong> to reduce load and improve the overall experience.</p>



<p>These new optimizations have been confirmed by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">full update notes</strong> for update 1.041.00.00, which is scheduled to launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday, February 17th, 2026, 6:30 p.m. PT)</strong>. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</li>



<li>Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</li>



<li> Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</li>



<li>Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</li>



<li>Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</li>



<li> Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</li>
</ul>



<p>Besides including these new CPU and GPU optimizations, <strong>the final major <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> update</strong> will introduce <strong>Arch-tempered Arkveld</strong> via a permanent Event Quest, and new <strong>10-star difficulty quests</strong> for Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad. It will also introduce a <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission</strong>, along with plenty of other new features. You can find all the details on the game's <strong><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-asia/Ver.1.041.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website.</a></strong></p>



<p>With the final major update launching this week, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team is likely shifting its full focus to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Master Rank expansion confirmed last week</a></strong>. Hopefully, it will introduce interesting <strong>new mechanics</strong> on par with those of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/"><strong>Iceborne</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><strong>Sunbreak</strong></a></em>, besides additional monsters and a higher difficulty tier to their base games.</p>

			<p>While an official confirmation has yet to be made, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></strong> is very likely going to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-insiders-are-corroborating-new-the-witcher-3-dlc-as-fans-believe-dlc-for-old-games-should-happen-more/"><strong>a new DLC expansion</strong></a> later this year. <span>Reportedly intended to bridge the gap between the third and upcoming fourth entries in the&nbsp;series, this new expansion is said to feature a&nbsp;new region,&nbsp;speculated to be&nbsp;<strong>Zerrikania</strong>.</span></p>



<p>According to a <strong>known Polish insider</strong>, however, people are <em>"looking too far away,"</em> suggesting the new explorable region will be <strong>closer to the regions</strong> we already have in the game, namely <strong>Velen</strong> and the <strong>Northern Kingdoms</strong>.</p>



<p>Commenting on old map design approaches in video games in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vQ4mx6fpDeE?si=4o6J6Smtw-CK65aB&amp;t=3335"><strong>a livestream</strong></a> earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UVograch"><strong>UV o grach</strong></a>, a former Gry-Online journalist with solid connections with the <strong>Polish gaming industry</strong>, made some comments about <strong>reusing assets</strong> and filling in the blanks on a map.</p>



<p>These statements sparked a wave of comments from <span>livestream watchers who started asking for updates on the yet-to-be-announced&nbsp;<em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em>&nbsp;</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong>. While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UV o grach</strong> did not confirm or deny anything outright, he suggested that people are <strong>looking at the horizon while the answer is right under their nose</strong>, essentially doubling down on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">earlier tidbit</strong> the former journalist dropped in early December about the new region being an extension of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> the Velen region</strong>, rather than a brand new one like the rumored <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-zerrikanian-dream-truly-dead">Is The Zerrikanian Dream Truly Dead?</h2>



<p>Is this the <em>"You mistake the stars reflected in a pond for the night sky"</em> moment for the <em>The Witcher 3</em> community, like <strong>Vilgefortz</strong> accused <strong>Geralt</strong> in the novels? <strong>Hard to say without an official announcement.</strong> </p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">creating a new region from scratch</strong> would probably be too much effort for a smaller team working on an expansion launching this long after the base game mostly meant to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">bridge the gap</strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 4's</em></strong> story, which, as far as we know, will be mainly set in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Kovir and Poviss</a></strong>. These two <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Northern Kingdoms</strong> on the Continent are even more far removed from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong> than the general areas where the first three entries in the series are set. </p>



<p>As such, it's more sensible both for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">lore</strong> and for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">actual game development</strong> to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">expand what is already included</strong> in the game, rather than coming up with a brand new region which may never be visited again, no matter how unique or exotic it would be.</p>



<p>As this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">new</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong> is reportedly <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">launching in May</strong></a>, it will likely not be much longer before we hear more about it, if it is indeed real. Hopefully, it will be an expansion worthy of one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best open-world role-playing games</strong> ever made.</p>

			<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> just <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-high-on-life-2-and-kingdom-come-deliverance-headline-new-xbox-game-pass-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> a few days ago, and now a "rumor" suggests its sequel, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong>, might join the library shortly. We said "rumor" because the tease <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from an official source</a>, the X account of Microsoft's subscription service, which brushed up the emails of "<strong>Melissa McGamepass</strong>" for the occasion.</p>



<p>For unfamiliar readers, Melissa McGamepass is <strong>a fictional person created by Xbox marketing</strong> for the specific purpose of <strong>teasing upcoming releases on the subscription service</strong>. The latest email of the "Chief Executive Director Chair of Senior Operations &amp; Grand Liaison of Video Game Communications" says:</p>



<p><em>We've got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year! Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn't say too much, but if you're getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be <strong>deliverance'd </strong>to Xbox Game Pass…. That's all for now! And as always, please keep this email 100% private! Like super-duper secret. Thank you.</em></p>



<p>Now, it wouldn't make much sense to tease the first game, since that's already been released on the service. Moreover, the Xbox team is teasing "something big", and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>would definitely qualify</strong>.</p>



<p>The game, released around a year ago, won critical and commercial acclaim from critics and fans alike. On Wccftech, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned a perfect score</a> from reviewer Chris Wray and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully won the <strong>Best RPG of 2025 award</strong> from staff and community</a>, beating even <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> in the category. Commercially, the Embracer Group just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>has already sold more than five million units</strong> across all platforms in its first year on the market. For comparison, the first game had only managed to sell two million units by that point.</p>



<p>This makes it a perfect fit for Xbox Game Pass: most users who wanted to get the game early already paid full price for it, but this way, <strong>it will open up the game to many others who wouldn't have otherwise played it</strong>, and maybe it will get some of them to purchase the available DLCs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 2 Delay Should Remain an Isolated Case, According to Devs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/</link>
            <guid>1437916</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Later today, <strong>Battlefield 6 Season 2</strong> will kick off in earnest on all platforms. The second season of the military first-person shooter's live service was famously <strong>delayed for about a month</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing outrage in the game's community</a>.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, producer <strong>Phil Girette</strong> has explained why that happened, while also suggesting it won't happen again following changes made internally across the various departments at <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> (which comprises DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio).</p>



<p><em>We came out of the launch from Battlefield 6, and we don't have the best of track records for launches, but it went pretty smooth this time around, so we're happy for that one. But that launch also takes a lot of work and time. We saw the content we had planned for Battlefield 6 Season 2 and we wanted just to give that a little bit more time in the oven to polish things and make sure we hit the expectations that players have.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, once you plan out seasons, there's a lot of things that come with that like the marketing work behind it, making sure the timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things. Future seasons as well. Absolutely, we need to make sure those hit as expected and we have taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly music for the ears of active players, although they may be more concerned with Battlefield 6 Season 2 itself. Our David <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a couple of hours of the new content in advance</a></strong> during a press preview event, and <strong>he wasn't exactly thrilled with what he saw</strong>:</p>



<p><em>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</em></p>



<p><em>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Battlefield 6 Season 2 right now.</em></p>



<p>If you're looking for the <strong>full overview</strong> of what's going to be in this season, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump to this article</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">For nine years</strong>, Styx and his begrudging companions, including the former goblin hunter Helledryn and the dark elf Djarak, have been <strong>away</strong> from our screens, and for their return, Cyanide planned <strong>something big</strong>. Since the launch of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, <strong>video games have changed a lot</strong>, and <strong>a linear stealth experience wouldn't have cut it</strong>. </p>



<p>As such, <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> overhauls the series' formula with a more&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/">complex world design</a></strong>,&nbsp;sandbox features, and a more open-ended structure that make the experience feel quite modern. Though still a <strong>little rough around the edges</strong>, the game delivers an <strong>engaging stealth experience</strong> without sacrificing the heart that has always characterized the series.</p>

<p>While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">supporting cast lacks Styx’s magnetic cynicism</strong>, they are fleshed out enough to feel like functional parts of the machine rather than mere set dressing.

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed's sandbox experience is one of the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">developer Cyanide couldn't go with the same linear sort of stealth experience</strong> featured in the previous entry in the series for the new game. <strong>The stealth genre has greatly evolved</strong> since the days of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, with an emphasis on open-level design and sandbox mechanics that simply couldn't be ignored in <em>Styx: Blades of Greed.</em></p>



<p>In this regard,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> the new entry in the series delivers</strong>, for sure. <strong>Locations</strong> such as The Wall, the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn, and the Ruins of Akenash, the elven capital, are <strong>much more open than anything the series has featured to date</strong>, with an open-world sandbox flair that gives the adventure a very personable feel.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Even in the Prologue, this feeling is unmistakable. </strong>Reaching The Wall with their zeppelin, Styx and his gang find themselves stranded in a location filled with all sorts of dangers, ranging from gangs of thieves and marauders and the powerful Inquisition, and it will only be with the help of some new allies that they will be able to take it up to the skies again in search of Quartz. Although in this early segment of the game Styx will have to recruit a new dwarven pilot and save a specific individual from the Inquisition <strong>in a set order</strong>, the <strong>openness</strong> of the experience is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The pronounced vertical design elevates stealth gameplay considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These early objectives may be set, but the options are not</strong>: to infiltrate the tavern where the dwarf pilot resides, for example, players can scale the tavern itself to enter the dwarf's room from a window, or infiltrate it from the main entrances, creating all sorts of distractions for the enemies inside, and so on.</span> Right from the onset, the locations' <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">vertical design is remarkable</strong>, providing so many opportunities for stealth and concealament that make the experience <strong>very engaging from the get-go</strong>, even with the limited tools Styx has at his disposal in the first few hours, which will be later <strong>expanded</strong> via the game's progression system with new gadgets and special powers, including the ability to create clones, improved perception to spot enemies hidden by environmental elements and so on.</p>



<p>Once the first Quartz is absorbed and the crew takes to the skies again, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the training wheels come off</strong>, and it's here that the experience turns into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a full sandbox stealth game</strong>. With a compass in tow, Styx will have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">search for multiple Quartz fragments scattered all over locations in any order the player wishes</strong>, with a challenge that can be greater or lower depending on the unlocked upgrades, with only the occasional forced story quest acting as a progression threshold every now and then. These Quartz-hunting missions are also <strong>quite varied</strong> and are never as straightforward as simply reaching a location. Something unexpected always happens, forcing players to always be on their toes and never grow complacent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Varied mission design is another of Styx: Blades of Greed's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides featuring a solid vertical design, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> maps have a marked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metroidvania feel</strong> centered on two of Styx's new tools: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Grappling Hook and the Glider</strong>. Unlocked a few hours into the adventure, both tools can be used to<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">access previously unaccesible locations</strong>, making not only the entire experience deeper with new stealth options, but also make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">progression more meaningful</strong> in a very tangible way, especially in light how many of core's upgrades to Styx's toolset are maybe unlocked a tad too slowly, often <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">requiring multiple Quartz shards</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blueprints</strong> to unlock via the game's skill trees.</p>



<p><span>Still, these unlocks are rather<strong>&nbsp;rewarding</strong>, especially the Quartz powers that give Styx some very powerful tools, such as <strong>Mind Control</strong>, moving at <strong>Super Speed</strong>, and unleashing a </span><strong><span>F</span>lux Blast</strong> to get rid of enemies. These, in combination with the <strong>passive abilities</strong> granted by Runes, give a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">build flexibility</strong> in a game that has no loot whatsoever.</p>

<p>Another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">core element</strong> that is required for a proper stealth experience is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid enemy AI</strong>, but it's here that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> starts to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some cracks</strong>. Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy variety is overall decent</strong>, with multiple human and non-human enemies, including stronger enemies that cannot be disposed of with a single stealth kill attempt and require more guile to eliminate, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">their AI leaves something to be desired at times.</strong> Their keen hearing forces players to proceed carefully to avoid tripping over chairs and other environmental elements, making noise, and their reasonable, decent sight, especially at long distances, forces a careful approach. However, there are times when the enemy doesn't see Styx even if he is located nearby and not exactly in concealment.</p>



<p>Thankfully, at the very least, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enemies are relentless when alerted</strong> and will hunt Styx until he manages to get away, so the experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains challenging</strong>, even if the AI sometimes falters. Unfortunately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it's </strong>during these frantic escapes that the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> roughness of the experience</strong> is felt the most: the basic control scheme is a little <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complicated</strong>, and doesn't feel very natural at the beginning, leading to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wrong action at the wrong time</strong>; <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">melee combat is terribly basic</strong>, limited to a dodge and dagger attack, and requires locking onto an enemy first, which is an unnatural setup for most third-person action games. In addition, there are too many times when Styx is <strong>stuck mid-jump in geometry elements</strong>, which can lead to some undeserved defeats in certain situations.</p>

<p>Luckily, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">any defeat is not the end of the world</strong>, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> allows players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">make quick saves at almost any time</strong>, even with a controller.

Hardcore fans of the series can ignore this feature and even disable it altogether by playing the game at the <strong>highest difficulty level</strong>.</p>

<p>The convoluted controls, the main character sometimes getting stuck in environmental geometry, and the wider assortment of bugs (including being able to take down enemies by grabbing them through walls), unfortunately, are only the <strong>tip of the proverbial iceberg</strong> regarding <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>'s <strong>technical state</strong>. <strong>Given the level of visuals</strong> the game pushes, which are acceptable but far from groundbreaking, <strong>one would expect solid performance</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>that is not the case.</strong></p>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, on PC, the game suffers from the widely known <strong>traversal stuttering issues</strong>, for which nothing the <strong>shader pre-compilation step</strong> can do. They are not terribly frequent, but they happen often enough that it is impossible not to notice them.</p>

<p><strong>General performance does not fare well</strong>, either. On my high-end system (<strong>i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM</strong>)<span>, the game averaged&nbsp;<strong>55 FPS, 27 1% low</strong>, in a benchmark session conducted on The Wall map at&nbsp;<strong>4K resolution with DLSS in Balanced mode, high settings,</strong></span><strong> and no Frame Generation</strong>. Needless to say, the game would be essentially unplayable <strong>without upscaling</strong> on anything but the absolute top-end systems. </p>



<p>Thankfully, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">hitting close to 60 FPS without any frame generation tech</strong> made the gameplay relatively smooth with either DLSS or FRS Frame Generation. As it isn't an intense action title that requires split-second reactions, this is generally more than enough to enjoy it, no matter how technically disappointing this level of performance is. However, since most players don't have a beefy system like mine, I'd suggest you wait for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">more tests on lower-end hardware before committing to a purchase on PC if you</strong> <strong>don't have a top-end machine</strong></p>
