			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 user interface could be coming very soon, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1614328">Famiiboards forums by user Kysen</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the system and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claiming to have a real unit in their hands</a>, revealed that this supposed real unit can be powered on. As such, there's a very good chance we will not only be able to see the console's user interface soon but possibly also learn more about some of the console's unique features, such as what the new button on the new Joy-Con is for and more.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, it seems like their functionality could have been expanded beyond the inclusion of the new mysterious button. As reported on the console's subreddit, one of the official patents seems to suggest that the new Joy-Con controllers could be attached to the system in more ways than two. This could lead to some interesting applications, as the patent also suggests that the screen rotates depending on how the Joy-Con controllers are attached.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1inh58y/possibly_reversible_joycons_machine_translated/">Possibly Reversible Joy-Cons (Machine Translated)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aster______/">u/Aster______</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Nintendo is usually pretty good at keeping its future hardware secret before official announcements, this wasn't the case with the Nintendo Switch 2, mostly due to how long it took for the company to announce it. Thanks to the multiple leaks, we have learned quite a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-clock-speeds-8nm-no-dlss/">system's specs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-specs-comparison/">how they compare to other gaming systems</a>, and what developers will be able to achieve with them.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide this year. A precise release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>A new multiplatform multiplayer project which started development at Bungie is going to be revealed during today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play show</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website <a href="https://vandal-elespanol-com.translate.goog/noticia/1350777986/sony-presentara-en-el-state-of-play-un-nuevo-y-curioso-multijugador-nacido-en-bungie-segun-nuestras-fuentes/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vandal</a>, which proved to be a reliable source of information in the past, shared today that the multiplayer project codenamed Gummy Bears, which managed to survive Bungie's restructuring l<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">ast year</a>, will be revealed today. The game, which is being developed by a new studio run by PlayStation Studios but still part of the Destiny series' developer, is said to be a colorful game featuring gameplay inspired by MOBAs with team-based confrontations and characters belonging to different classes, and some other elements inspired by the Super Smash Bros. series. Additionally, it is said that players will be able to interact with one another between games in ways that will allow them to express their personalities.</p>
<p>Judging from the information above, the new Bungie project will clearly be aimed at a younger audience. As such, it isn't surprising to learn that the game is reportedly launching on Nintendo Switch, as well as on PC and PlayStation 5 later this year. Gummy Bears is also reportedly being shown during the rumored Nintendo Direct, which is supposedly scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>Project Gummy Bears may not be the only Bungie project shown during today's State of Play. In an update shared<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/"> last year</a>, the studio teased that more information on Marathon would be coming this year, so today's show would be the perfect occasion to show what the studio has been working on for some time.</p>
