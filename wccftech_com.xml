			<p>When NO LAW was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at The Game Awards 2025, it was hard not to draw a comparison with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The new project from Neon Giant, the studio behind The Ascent, is also set in a cyberpunk city, and it's a single player first-person open world shooter RPG, much like the more famous game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-celebrates-5th-anniversary-heavy-dsicount-new-trading-card-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently celebrated its fifth anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>In the first post-reveal interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-of-no-law-know-everyone-will-compare-it-to-cyberpunk-2077-but-there-are-important-differences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Neon Giant Co-Founder and Creative Director Tor Frick acknowledged the comparison but also explained why NO LAW is going to be a lot different from Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p><em>I think obviously every day we have to do that internally as well. Because we know what Cyberpunk is and we know people will compare us. But the game is very different and the world is very different. A lot of it is, it's just the mood and the tone. Cyberpunk is a big, sprawling experience. It's a mega city. And our game is a lot more intimate both when it comes to the gameplay mechanics but also the world. I think as people see more of the game that will be more apparent. It's hard to do in a short trailer like that. I think you need to see and feel the game more. It is more of an intimate experience, like the world is deep but not so grand. And the same thing with mechanics and the same thing with the story. It is very, very personal and very, very reactive around you as a player, rather than being set in this grand backdrop.</em></p>



<p>The studio's other Co-Founder and Creative Director, Arcade Berg, added that NO LAW also features a slight tongue-in-cheek tone like The Ascent, in contrast to Cyberpunk 2077's far more serious vibe. Other inspirations include 80s-90s action movies, which were also a bit campy, as well as Hong Kong action scenes, and even manga and anime.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, the main character, Grey Harker, is a seasoned veteran who chooses to retire from active military service following the severe injuries sustained during his previous deployment to pursue a life of peace. He had abandoned violence in favor of caring for his plants, but eventually, trouble walked through his door all the same, a bit like in John Wick, prompting him to return and make those who had wronged him pay.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X with no set release window. It will be published by KRAFTON, which acquired Neon Giant a few years ago.</p>

			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 – Everything We Know about Team Ninja’s Supernatural Action RPG]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Several years after the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 2</a>, Team Ninja returns to the series with <strong>Nioh 3</strong>, after cleansing their palate with many other franchises. Except for 2021, the highly prolific division of Koei Tecmo has released a new game every year, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> in 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> in 2023, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> in 2025. Most of these games had their own twists: Stranger of Paradise was a peculiar (and controversial) reinterpretation of the original Final Fantasy featuring a whole party of characters; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was the studio's first foray into a Chinese fantasy setting; Rise of the Ronin was an ambitious open world action RPG similar to the recent Assassin's Creed games; and of course, Ninja Gaiden 4 allowed the studio to reintroduce its most prized IP to newer generations with the help of PlatinumGames.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden may be witnessing a resurgence in popularity, but the Nioh series also gained a significant following over time. Koei Tecmo is now self-publishing the new game, too, so they have an even greater interest in making a bigger splash with this new entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Nioh 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during June 2025's State of Play event. Right away, Koei Tecmo confirmed the early 2026 target release window. In September, Amazon Japan <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> the final release date of <strong>February 6, 2026</strong>, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a few hours later during September's State of Play.</p>



<p>Players will be able to test the game ahead of its release, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free demo</a> launching on <strong>January 29, 2026</strong>. The demo's save file will carry over to the full version, allowing demo players to continue the journey right away.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, whereas the first two Nioh titles were published by Sony and released on PlayStation 5 several months before the PC version as part of the exclusivity agreement, this new game is being published by Koei Tecmo and is therefore the first in the franchise to get a <strong>simultaneous release on PlayStation 5 and PC</strong> (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>).</p>



<p>Nioh 3 can already be pre-purchased on both platforms. There are two editions: the Standard one, priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, and the Digital Deluxe Edition, priced at <strong>$109.99</strong>. The latter includes the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Base game</li>



<li>Season pass comprising two DLCs, one due by the end of September 2026 and the second by the end of February 2027</li>



<li>Season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have a Pre-Order Bonus and an Early Purchase Bonus. The former will activate if you buy the game before the launch date, whereas the latter can still be received as long as you purchase Nioh 3 by <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. The Pre-Order Bonus provides the Hellfire Equipment Set (Hellfire Warrior Armor set + Hellfire Ninja Attire set) and Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm (accessory), whereas the Early Purchase Bonus grants you access to the Hellfrost Equipment Set (Hellfrost Warrior Armor set + Hellfrost Ninja Attire set). Koei Tecmo clarified that these bonuses could be sold separately or given away for free at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, Nioh 3 can be described as a challenging<strong> action RPG</strong>, primarily focused around punishing one-on-one duels and boss encounters rooted in Japanese swordplay and yokai folklore. After the intermission of Nioh 2 (which served as a prequel to the first Nioh chronologically), the story returns to the late <strong>Sengoku period</strong> (16th century). The main protagonist is <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a young warrior poised to become <span>the Shogun, while his embittered younger brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tokugawa Kunimatsu,</strong>&nbsp;secretly conspires to overthrow him</span> with a horde of yokai (demons in Japanese folklore). Besieged by his brother, Takechiyo travels through time to alter the course of destiny and preserve Japan with the help of his guardian spirit, Kusanagi.</p>



<p>Throughout the course of the narrative, Takechiyo will traverse the Sengoku, Heian, Bakumatsu, and early Edo eras. The developers have confirmed that throughout the game, players will encounter a plethora of historical figures, including, but not limited to, Himiko, Saito Fuku, Hattori Hanzo, Honda Tadakatsu, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Yagyu Munenori, and Takasugi Shinsaku.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Team Ninja pitched Nioh 3 to fans as an evolution of the series' stance-based combat into a dual-style system where players can freely swap between <strong>Samurai</strong> and <strong>Ninja</strong> modes mid-fight. The <strong>Samurai</strong> style broadly resembles Nioh 1 and 2, emphasizing precision melee with katana and traditional arms, ki (stamina) management, and stance variations, enhanced by new techniques and counters introduced in this new title. The new <strong>Ninja</strong> style, on the other hand, offers a distinctly different experience that emphasizes speed, evasive maneuvers, aerial attacks, and trick-based offense, encouraging hit-and-run and mobility-heavy builds. Players can chain style swaps on the fly, opening hybrid combos that weave heavy samurai strikes into evasive ninja strings. Most of the other familiar series pillars, like guardian spirits, yokai abilities, and loot-driven progression, are returning, albeit now largely tied into a new endgame challenge framework dubbed <strong>The Crucible</strong>, which appears to function as a high-risk, high-reward gauntlet layered on top of the campaign.</p>



<p>The other major innovation is that Team Ninja moved away from the strictly mission-based map of earlier entries toward what they are calling an <strong>“open field”</strong> structure. This doesn't mean a traditional open world; instead, you can expect larger interconnected regions dotted with settlements, roaming yokai, and optional encounters, providing more continuous exploration without abandoning curated combat arenas. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our most recent hands-on preview</a>, main and sub-missions still anchor the experience, but surfacing them organically in the landscape makes progressing through a region feel less like hopping between menus and more like inhabiting a continuous war-torn countryside. Every detour—whether it is sweeping up loot, tackling Myths sidequests from NPCs, clearing Enemy Bases, or hunting down Crucible Wraiths—pushes up a regional Exploration Level that hands out permanent perks, from raw stat bumps to a fully revealed map dotted with markers for points of interest. On top of the usual torrent of gear and materials, those activities drip-feed skill points for the game’s sprawling trees and layer in extra blessings from friendly yokai and Jizo Statues. </p>



<p>Speaking during a recent interview, producer Fumihiko Yasuda also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that while the game will respect the series tradition of being quite hard, there won't be any sudden difficulty spikes. This should lessen frustration for newcomers to Nioh.  </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Team Ninja is one of the few triple-A studios that has not switched to Epic's Unreal Engine. Nioh 3 will still run on the studio's proprietary Katana Engine, last seen in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Based on the studio's previous games, the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro are likely to offer Performance and Quality modes, although this has yet to be confirmed for this title.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC system requirements of Nioh 3</a> confirmed that Frame Generation will be supported, though they do not specify whether it's AMD's, NVIDIA's, Intel's, or some combination of the three. An SSD is required.</p>

<p>The game supports cooperative multiplayer, but cross-play, as confirmed by Koei Tecmo to Wccftech, won't be available. To play with friends, you'll have to buy Nioh 3 on the same platform.</p>
