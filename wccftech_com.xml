			<p>The physical release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> won't require an additional download to run, as the entire game will be included in the cart.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, CD Projekt Red's Vice President of Business Jan Rosner confirmed the game will ship on a 64 GB cart that includes both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, so no additional download will be required to run the game. The game will launch the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide for the price of $69.99, €69.99.</p>

<p>At the time, we haven't seen much of Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition running on Nintendo Switch 2 besides the short trailer shown during yesterday's Nintendo Direct, but it seems like a high refresh rate experience is out of the cards, even in docked mode. Earlier today, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed, after a hands-on session, that the game runs at 40 FPS in Performance Mode with the console docked, which is definitely disappointing for those who expected a 60 FPS mode, but not completely unexpected, considering how demanding the game can be.</p>

<p lang="en">Some other Switch 2 observations:<br>
- The "Welcome Tour" app is surprisingly cool (one minigame reminded me of Mario Paint) and it is insane that Nintendo is charging for it<br>
- Metroid looks and feels fantastic<br>
- Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 40fps in performance mode while docked (oof)</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rumors about the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware supporting NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing features have been circulating since 2023, based on the assumption that the underlying chipset would be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, Nintendo did not mention these features at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the Direct</a> or in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent article</a> posted on the official website. After the showcase, the folks at Digital Foundry went through the released footage of Nintendo Switch 2 games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there was no indication of NVIDIA DLSS being featured in those games, casting further doubts on what seemed like a certainty.</p>
<p>Now, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has got Nintendo on the record about the subject</a>. Takuhiro Dohta, senior director at Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Division and one of three people seen in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, revealed:</p>
<p><em>We use DLSS upscaling technology and that's something that we need to use as we develop games. And when it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K. Whether the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, the GPU does support ray tracing. As with DLSS, I believe this provides yet another option for the software developers to use and a tool for them.</em></p>
<p>When IGN tried to obtain further details about the GPU included in the Nintendo Switch 2, Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo's Technology Development Division and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, replied that Nintendo does not like to discuss the finer technical details. However, Sasaki-san added that NVIDIA should share more information&nbsp;at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Based on previously rumored information, the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU should be powered by NVIDIA's Ampere architecture and feature 2048 CUDA Cores, while its 8-core CPU should include 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores. Earlier this year, a leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Switch 2 is capable of 1.71 TFLOPS in handheld mode with a GPU clocked at 561 MHz, while the docked mode (which, as Nintendo has confirmed, is boosted by a fan this time around) can go up to 3.1 TFLOPS thanks to the higher GPU speed of 1000 MHz.</p>
<p>We'll find out if these leaks were correct soon enough.</p>
