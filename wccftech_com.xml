			<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/">highly anticipated</a> 007 First Light is due to have another deep dive later today during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> event focused entirely on gameplay in the Hitman studio's take on James Bond, and a few details about the game have leaked ahead of the showcase, though nothing to do with how the game will play.</p>



<p>From prominent and reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580">Billbil-kun</a>, the price for the standard edition of 007 First Light appeared on an Amazon listing, which pins the game at $70 USD for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 editions. That marks it as another game where players don't have to worry about spending $80 to play it, but if you wanted more than just the game, IO Interactive is more than happy to oblige with a collector's edition, with a price set at a whopping $300.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ðŸš¨ EXCLUSIVE - 2026 ðŸš¨</p><p>007 First Light from IO Interactive will be released in Physical format + Collectors Edition</p><p>And you can even pre-order them from now!</p><p>ðŸ”¸ Standard Edition (PS5, Xbox Series, Switch 2): 69.99 US$</p><p>ðŸ”¹ Collectors: 299.99 US$<br>- PS5: <a href="https://t.co/65g723UT7x">https://t.co/65g723UT7x</a></p></div>â€” billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>We don't yet know what that $300 price tag gets you besides a copy of the game, though if it's anything like other collector's editions, the remaining $230 likely covers the cost of a statue or figure representative of the game's charming protagonist and a few other bits and bobs for the biggest James Bond enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>



<p>What's perhaps more intriguing for those looking forward to 007 First Light, is that if price information has leaked hours ahead of today's gameplay deep dive, then that means we are likely hours away from learning the game's official release date. We already know the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/">game is due out in 2026</a>, but IO Interactive has refrained from saying when in 2026 we'll be able to order our 'shaken, not stirred' vodka martini's. Hopefully, we'll find out today.</p>

			<p>Hytopia is a platform of games not entirely dissimilar to Roblox, with the key difference being its focus on blockchain games, and it has just launched its latest major title, SkyGarden, in open beta on its <a href="https://hytopia.com/games/">website</a>.</p>



<p>SkyGarden is a farming MMORPG that will immediately remind you of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">Minecraft</a>, but that's not a mistake considering the fact that the development team includes the Minecraft artist Sebu, and is led by notable web developer<a href="https://x.com/GamingEtheria"> Shrimp</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game is free-to-play and allows players to build their own farms, grow crops, raise cattle, and create decorations for their farm to make it their own. Crops will also continue to grow even when players are offline, so you'll need to check in to keep your farm tidy and successful as you sell your crops and grown resources.</p>



<p>It's a milestone launch for the platform as it continues to try and grow its player base and developer base with games like SkyGardens and calls for developers, giving them <a href="https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/news/39771/hytopia-paying-25000-dev-teams-make-a-game-in-90-days/">$25K</a> if they can make a game within 90 days.</p>
