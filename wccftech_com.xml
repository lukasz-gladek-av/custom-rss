			<p>After a long wait, Battlefield 6 is finally here, and it's also an excellent return to form for the series after a disappointing release in Battlefield 2042. If you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players on Steam (and potentially millions with consoles mixed in) jumping into it on launch, then this guide will help you step onto the battlefield with confidence.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class/">our guide on the best early loadouts</a> delved into what weapons you'll want to jump in with and focus on unlocking as soon as possible, this guide will go over more general tips and ways of thinking when you're playing to help you have the right mindset for each match.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-tips-to-rule-the-battlefield">Battlefield 6 Guide - Tips to Rule the Battlefield</h2>



<h3 id="h-play-your-role-and-play-together">Play your role, and play together</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield has always been a squad-focused game. Its class system is there for a reason, and especially when jumping into its signature modes like Conquest, which take full advantage of the multiple ground and air vehicles available, playing your role is key to success.</p>



<p>If you're running Support, keep your defibrillator handy and use it as often as you can. If you're playing Engineer, keep a launcher in your loadout to help take out tanks and jets if you can lock onto one. If you're playing Recon, be sure to spot enemy vehicles and mark them for your teammates, and try to keep an eye on the edges for enemies looking to flank your side. If you're playing Assault, use your added firepower and stay on the frontlines.</p>



<p>Every role is important, and playing your role instead of just running at enemies looking for kills is the difference between winning and losing a match, no matter what mode you're playing, but especially when playing any of the large-scale game modes.</p>



<h3 id="h-keep-an-eye-on-your-mag">Keep an eye on your mag</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a simple tip, but that doesn't make it any less important. Battlefield is not Call of Duty, where you'll die long before you run out of bullets. It's very possible that being a little too trigger-happy can leave you without ammo for your primary weapon, and unless you're playing Support and can give yourself an ammo refresh, you'll be a free kill for the other side. </p>



<p>Yes, respawning is the fastest way to get back to a full magazine, but when dying means your side is down in reinforcements, you're actively hurting your side's chances of winning. You want to try to survive as long as possible, and part of that is keeping an eye on your ammo and not reloading the moment you let a few bullets fly. Time your reloads well, wait until you're towards the bottom of your magazine, and you know that if you were to get into another firefight, you'd lose it because you can't take out an enemy with sub-8 bullets.</p>



<p>It should also be said that keeping yourself mobile while in a firefight can be the difference between dying and getting a kill. If you can, dive to cover and use that time to reload if you absolutely have to. Use a grenade to give yourself even more time. Don't just spray and pray, and keep an eye on your ammo.</p>



<h3 id="h-go-ahead-jump-in-the-tank">Go ahead, jump in the tank</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Vehicles are a key part of Battlefield gameplay, and Battlefield 6 is no different. If a vehicle is available, don't be afraid to jump in. Having a tank on the battlefield for your squad or a jet fighter can be a huge difference maker, and you should be hesitant to jump in when you get the chance.</p>



<p>You can do solid damage to enemy frontlines, help take some of your squadmates across the map, and hold down the defensive line for your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-mount-your-launcher-to-your-rifle">Mount your launcher to your rifle</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can add a grenade launcher to your loadout as one of your gadgets, and the default way of doing so is swapping to it as a separate weapon. That's perfectly fine, of course, but to swap to your launcher even faster, mount it to your rifle. You can attach it as an underbarrel attachment, and it'll be a quick flick to swap from your launcher to your rifle.</p>



<h3 id="h-pay-attention-to-your-loadouts-and-weapon-customizations">Pay attention to your loadouts and weapon customizations</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is another tip that should feel obvious, but it's still worth saying - pay attention to your loadouts and your weapon customizations. Even seemingly small adjustments can make a difference in how a weapon performs for you, whether that's adjusting the ammo type to deal more penetration damage or a different magazine for a faster reload, or better ergonomics. </p>



<p>Your choice of attachments is just as important as your choice of weapons, and it's worth spending the time in the menu, going back and forth from menu to the firing range, to try things out and see how they feel for you.</p>



<h3 id="h-ping-your-enemies">Ping your enemies!</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you're not playing Recon and don't have a laser designator, you can still call out enemies for your squadmates. Use the ping system to help you and your squadmates keep track of enemies on the battlefield.</p>



<p>With the size of the maps in Battlefield 6, using the Ping system effectively can be a huge help, especially if you're not one for jumping into proximity chat or typing in the game chat. More so than in other multiplayer shooters, communication is key!</p>



<hr>



<p>These are just a few key tips to remember and to help you dominate on the battlefield now that Battlefield 6 is finally here.</p>

			<p>Nintendo is rumored to be the latest high-profile target of the hacker group Crimson Collective, according to a new online report.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/H4ckmanac">cyber intelligence firm Hackmanac</a>, the hacking group shared a screenshot showing folders of <em>"Nintendo topic files,"</em> claiming they are now in possession of the data. The Japanese company has yet to issue a statement or confirm any breach, making the group's claim impossible to verify at the time of writing (October 11 - 10:03 AM EDT)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this cyberattack against Nintendo has yet to be officially confirmed, the Crimson Collective hacking group has already maliciously attacked other companies in the past few days, so an attack against Nintendo is not outside the realm of possibility. </p>



<p>Only this month, the Crimson Collective group attacked company Red Hat, breaching the software company's private GitHub repositories to steal 570GB of data. Red Hat itself confirmed the breach shortly after the attack, following claims from the hacking group that it had made extortion demands to the company. If the attack against Nintendo is real, there's a good chance the hacking group also made similar demands to the Japanese company.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks against video game companies are not a new occurrence, and many companies have had data stolen, ranging from information about yet-to-be-announced projects to personal information of employees. Insomniac Games, developer of Marvel's Spider-Man games and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">upcoming Marvel's Wolverine</a>, was the target of a massive cyberattack back in 2023, which resulted in confidential information making its way on the web.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ea-app-outage-leads-franchise-head-to-recommend-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-ea-app-outage-leads-franchise-head-vince-zampella-to-recommend-using-steam-instead.1322578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, when the Battlefield 6 servers went live, some users who purchased the game on PC via the EA app experienced a nasty entitlement issue that essentially locked them out of playing any of the game's modes. Most users received a message saying they were missing DLC content, and the bug quickly became a meme. A few hours later, everything was fixed, and the impacted players even received some bonuses for their troubles:</p>



<p><em>Today, we experienced an outage on the EA app that prevented some of our players who pre-ordered Battlefield 6 from accessing the game, and we know this can be frustrating so we wanted to offer an apology… with perks. The fix has been rolled out. But we aren't done.</em></p>



<p><em>Anyone on the EA app who was impacted will receive 12 Hardware and 12 Career 60-Minute Boosters, which should be arriving in impacted players' in-game inbox this weekend. In addition, we will also be granting impacted players full access to a seasonal Battle Pass. If impacted players purchased the Phantom Edition, we will be granting them access to Season 2's full Battle Pass.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interestingly, while the bug was still active, Vince Zampella very candidly <a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976738354164277604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told his X followers</a> that he was playing on Steam and recommended getting a refund on the EA app and purchasing the game again on Steam. </p>



<p><em>I have yelled about EA app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation? </em></p>



<p><em>I am playing on Steam. Can you refund and buy on Steam?</em></p>



<p>It might be strange to see the head of the Battlefield franchise recommend something that effectively goes against the interests of his employer (EA gets full revenue through its own app, whereas it has to give Valve a cut of every purchase made through Steam, just like everyone else), but then again, EA CEO Andrew Wilson is more likely to commend Zampella on a job well done. </p>



<p>The former studio head of Infinity Ward and current studio head of Respawn Entertainment and Ripple Effect Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was appointed new head of the IP in December 2021</a>, just a couple of weeks after the disastrous launch of Battlefield 2042. Given <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how well Battlefield 6 has been reviewed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial concurrency data from Steam</a>, it seems like Zampella and the teams involved (Ripple Effect, DICE, Criterion, and Motive) successfully pulled off a strong comeback for the military shooter series.</p>



<p>That said, if you are playing on PC, there's a chance you might encounter some weird errors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We've compiled a troubleshooting guide here</a> to help with those. </p>

			<p>Like many other modern PC releases, Battlefield 6 launched with some issues that prevent players from playing the highly anticipated new entry in EA's FPS series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/">which works flawlessly on most modern GPUs</a>. Thankfully, most of these issues are minor and can be easily fixed.</p>



<p><em>Note: Due to the nature of PC gaming, with different system configurations and driver versions, and with various versions of the game (Steam, EA App, Epic Games Store) these fixes are not guaranteed to work for all players. They are, however, the most common solutions available for the up-to-date version of the game as of October 11, 2025.</em></p>

<h3 id="h-quick-fix-checklist">Quick Fix Checklist</h3>



<p>Before attempting any in-depth fixes, try these simple, common fixes.</p>



<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Restart the Steam/EA App/Epic Games Store app and Battlefield 6:</strong> Close the game and your platform's launcher, then restart them. This forces an automatic recheck of licenses and updates that may fix minor issues.</li>



<li><strong>Verify/Repair Game Files:</strong> Try the <em>"Verify Integrity Of Game Files" option in Steam or the </em>repair function in the EA App. This fixes corrupted files that may prevent the game from working.</li>



<li><strong>Clear EA App Cache (EA App Users):</strong> Clearing the EA App cache is a common solution for any license verification issue.<br></li>
</ol>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BF6-integrity-of-files.png"></a><figcaption>You can find the option to <em>Verify integrity of game files</em> in <strong>Properties &gt; Installed Files</strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-game-not-released-error-steam">Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" Error (Steam)</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" error is a Steam issue that prevents some users from downloading or updating the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BF6-DLC-fix-for-Game-Not-Released.png"></a><figcaption>Uncheck the top two options and the error will disappear</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: The development team has shared an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976862813437280350">official workaround</a>, requiring the user to open the game's Properties on Steam and uncheck the Battlefield Multiplayer HD Marker and Battlefield Multiplayer Marker DLC. Alternative fixes include restarting the Steam client or rebooting your system, and some people also got success by disabling <strong>NVIDIA Smooth Motion</strong> or clearing the <strong>Download Cache</strong>. An official fix has yet to be implemented.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-won-t-launch">Battlefield 6 Won't Launch</h2>



<p>For some users, Battlefield 6 will crash right after the splash screen, and will not launch.</p>



<p><strong>Fix: </strong>Enable Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings. To do so, you have to make sure your system's BIOS Mode is UEFI and your Windows drive's partition is GPT and:</p>



<ol>
<li>Restart your system and enter the BIOS setting menu by holding the appropriate key for your motherboard (usually the Delete key, F11 or F12)</li>



<li>Access the Advanced Mode in the menu</li>



<li>Access the Boot or Secure Boot option</li>



<li>Enable Secure Boot if disabled.</li>



<li>Save changes and reboot your system</li>
</ol>



<figure><figcaption><em>Before you can fight other soldiers, technical issues may be your Battlefield 6 fiercest enemies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-directx-error-dxgi-error-device-removed"><strong>Battlefield 6 DirectX Error "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED"</strong></h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 DirectX DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED error is caused by your GPU not correctly recognized by the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Make sure you have the latest drivers from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html">AMD</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/software/drivers.html">Intel</a> for your graphics card. Updated drivers can also address performance or stability issues. Also, make sure all GPU and CPU overclocks are disabled. Reinstalling the game may also fix this issue. If these fixes don't work, you will have to wait for a patch to address this issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-purchase-to-play-or-content-not-installed-error-ea-app">Battlefield 6 "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" Error (EA App)</h2>



<p>The "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" error is an EA App issue that prevents the game from starting due to a license verification issue. As the EA App cannot verify if you have purchased the game, it will launch, but you cannot play it.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Clear the EA APP Cache or restart the game. If this doesn't work, you should try reinstalling the game. Joining an active game, whether a friend's or one found via the Community Server Browser, was also confirmed to be a working workaround for some users.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: An <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976679780264153186">official fix</a> is in the works.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-queue-and-server-errors">Battlefield 6 Queue and Server Errors</h2>



<p>Several users are stuck in long queues for online multiplayer or are encountering "Server Disconnected" or "An Unidentified Error occurred" errors.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> For long queues, you only have to wait for your turn. Don't quit, or you will start waiting again from the back of the queue! There are no fixes for the other issues, as they are server-side issues that require developer intervention.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-long-or-infinite-loading-screen">Battlefield 6 Long or Infinite Loading Screen</h2>



<p>Sometimes, Battlefield 6 is stuck in a long, potentially infinite, loading screen.</p>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Restarting the game is the only known fix for this issue. If you cannot close the game by closing its window, do so with Task Manager (CTRL+Shift+Esc) after pressing Alt+Tab to get out of the game.</p>



<p>If any of the fixes above have solved your issues, and you can finally enjoy Battlefield 6, congratulations! If you need help with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class/">early weapons and loadouts from each class</a> to have a great time even as you are starting, we have got you covered!</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched ray tracing effects in an effort to deliver optimal performance</a> (which the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely achieved</a>, as the game runs as smoothly as butter). However, the game, powered by the latest version of the Frostbite engine, is still quite the visual treat.</p>



<p>YouTuber ElAnalistaDeBits has decided to compare the game's maps to their real-life counterparts. In the video embedded below, we can see how the Gibraltar and New York City maps (Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Manhattan Bridge) stand up to the real locations. Overall, the developers have done an admirable job, to be sure, though of course, there are a few creative liberties here and there. After all, the purpose was not to make the Battlefield 6 maps 1:1 replicas; instead, they sought to replicate the location's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mere hours after the Battlefield 6 launch, the new installment in the popular military first-person shooter series <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">has already thrashed any previous Steam concurrency records in the franchise</a> with 747K concurrent players. To be fair, though, successful entries such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 only landed on Steam in June 2020, many years after their actual debuts. That's because Electronic Arts tried to use the games to push its own launcher, Origin, making them exclusive to the platform. The company <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only decided to switch strategy in late 2019</a>, returning its games to Valve's platform. Battlefield 2042 launched on November 19, 2021 on both Origin and Steam, but that game had its own issues and only reached a peak of 107K concurrent players.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying Battlefield 6, perhaps <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review written by David Carcasole</a> can help you decide:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play. The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em></p>
