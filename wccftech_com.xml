			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 continues its solid sales performance. The game developed by Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=space+marine+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units within a day of its debut (considering pre-orders, of course) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out</a> to be the second best-selling game launch of the year in Europe. Less than three months later, the studio <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/119-november-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Space Marine 2 broke the milestone of five million copies sold, which proves that the game was well-received among the notoriously picky Warhammer 40K fans.</p>
<p>Saber also took the opportunity to reveal to the community that Patch 5.0 would be released in the first half of December, which means in the next couple of weeks. The update will add a new PvE co-op Operation called Obelisk, in which players must rotate a replica of the Obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This Operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p>
<p>To reach the console control of the obelisk, players must venture through a dark tomb. It will be even more challenging due to a new addition to the Chaos roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy. They will now appear in every PvE Operation featuring Chaos.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also getting a big customization improvement with the next update. Color lenses have finally been added, allowing players to customize between fifteen colors. Moreover, the patch will also bring the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, adding the unique armor set Dark Angels Champion as well as three themed weapons and one themed shield (for the Bulwark class).</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Patch 5.0 will introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation, bumping frame rates across the board on PC.</p>

<p>Saber also told fans to look forward to Titus's story continuing in Amazon's Secret Level Prime Video series, which will feature a dedicated Space Marine 2 episode. To celebrate the event, they will activate special Twitch Drops between December 10 and 31.</p>
