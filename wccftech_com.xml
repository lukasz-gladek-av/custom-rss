			<p>In a press release shared late yesterday evening, Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 failed to meet its sales estimates. Due to the game's underperformance, the publisher has been forced to make a non-cash write-down of around $37 million in 'capitalized development costs'.</p>



<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said that the company is proud of the work done by The Chinese Room (which replaced the original developer, Hardsuit Labs), but also admitted that the sales will not match the projections. In a refreshing move, the executive took the blame on the publisher's side instead of blaming the developers as so often happens nowadays, adding that Paradox's lack of expertise in the action RPG genre made it challenging to gauge the game's sales properly.</p>



<p>In the future, Wester vowed to return to the publisher's core market, which has always been in the grand strategy genre. Paradox's most accomplished games are, after all, Imperator: Rome, the Crusader Kings series, the Europa Universalis series (which has just received <a href="https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its fifth main installment</a>), the Victoria series, the Hearts of Iron series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellaris-out-of-this-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellaris</a>. This isn't surprising, as Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja already <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> last year that another Bloodlines title would be licensed out instead of developed internally.</p>



<p>Indeed, Fredrik Wester said:</p>



<p><em>We’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.</em></p>



<p>That said, Paradox confirmed that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is still getting its two DLCs as planned, as well as other free post-launch updates. In the DLCs, players will find themselves in the shoes of different characters: Loose Cannon is focused on the former Sheriff of the Seattle Court, Benny Muldoon, whereas The Flower &amp; the Flame lets you play as the Toreador vampire Ysabella. The first DLC will be available in Q2 2026, with the second DLC following in Q3.</p>



<p>Recently, former The Chinese Room Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-bloodlines-2-creative-director-wanted-to-call-the-game-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that he attempted to persuade Paradox to change the game's name because the studio lacked the time and resources to create a proper Bloodlines game. Alas, the publisher did not relent, and the result is abysmal sales and mixed reviews.</p>



<p>I somewhat enjoyed my time with Bloodlines 2, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in the review</a> that its several flaws only warranted purchase at a much lower price, and even then, only for fans of Vampire: The Masquerade. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Blood of Dawnwalker’s Freedom Is Closer to Fallout 1 & 2 and Pen-and-Paper Games, Says Developer]]></title>

			<p>Independent Polish developer Rebel Wolves is hard at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut open world action roleplaying game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be published by Bandai Namco</a>.</p>



<p>The studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">founded</a> in 2022 by former CD Projekt RED developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with some investment from NetEase</a>), and indeed, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks a lot like The Witcher III: Wild Hunt on the surface</a>. However, the game has been designed to offer much greater freedom to players, as outlined by Game Director Konrad Tomaskiewicz <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Eurogamer</a> at the recent Golden Joystick Awards 2025:</p>



<p><em>No, there's no main quest. You build your experience from the quests you encounter. You know where your enemy is. You can attack this place anytime you want to. It's up to you if you want to do it by yourself, or if you want to build yourself, find the powerful items, develop your character, or do some quests and find allies to help you do it. We want to bring video games closer to pen-and-paper RPGs and give you the freedom to experience what you want to experience.</em></p>



<p>When asked by the interviewer if the concept in The Blood of Dawnwalker was kind of similar to Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance games, Tomaskiewicz said the approach was rather more similar to the first two Fallout installments:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance is not a bad example, but still they have the main story that develops; you have the open world and the main quest which is leading you. In our game it's different. Our game is more similar in this area to the old Fallout, the first and second games, where you have a clear goal and everything is optional - you decide. You travel the world, you decide what you want to do. There is no main quest.</em></p>



<p>On a related note, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/dawnwalker-will-have-serious-consequences-for-both-action-and-inaction-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously noted</a> that The Blood of Dawnwalker would feature heavy consequences for both action and inaction, highlighting its strong roleplaying elements.</p>

			<p>PC and consoles sent to repair shops come with all sorts of issues, but a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 </a>unit sent to a shop in the United States definitely wins the award for the most disgusting. The system needed to be debugged, in the most literal sense.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Dystopia</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dvdgameexchangeutah/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DVD Game Exchange Repair Center</a>, a repair shop based in Orem, Utah, recently received a broken PlayStation 5 for repairs. After opening up the system, and verifying that the power supply was not to blame, it was discovered that the system was likely no longer working due to a serious bug. Or rather, many of them.</p>



<p>After discovering cockroach droppings all over the system's components, which is disgusting enough, the repair shop rep showed in the video how cockroaches were actively crawling out of the console. The truly literal "debugging," however, will have to be conducted by the owner of the system. The repain center wrapped up the console in plastic to prevent the insects from escaping before sending it back.</p>

Started the diagnostics, saw what was inside, and immediately decided to pack it up and send it back.

</div></figure>



<p>Scouring the X thread, other users reported all sorts of disgusting stories, including one about a PC tower case with a black widow spider infestation, so this cockroach-infested PlayStation 5 is hardly the first system to become a nest for bugs. </p>



<p>Still, this stands as a warning to all console and PC users: clear your systems frequently, as they can house something much worse than dust. A small investment of time cleaning now could save you from a truly stomach-churning repair bill later.</p>



<p>Besides having to clean their PlayStation 5 systems as often as possible to prevent issues like the above, owners of older models also need to be aware of the known <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid metal issues caused by a design flaw</a>, which can cause permanent damage to the system. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank">Although it has been addressed in more recent models</a>, it remains</span> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a widely reported issue.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> in its most recent financial report that it would acquire more gaming studios? Well, it didn't take long for it to actually happen.</p>



<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in a press release that it has entered an agreement to acquire Bandai Namco Studios Singapore from Bandai Namco. So far, the Singapore studio has functioned in a co-development capacity on Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival, Soul Calibur VI, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, and Splatoon 3. Clearly, it is their work on the latter game that caught Nintendo's attention, as clarified in the announcement:</p>



<p><em>BNSS has contributed to the development of Nintendo titles, including the Splatoon series, and has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo. Considering this business record, Nintendo has made the decision to acquire shares in BNSS to strengthen the development structure of the Nintendo Group.</em></p>



<p>Splatoon 3 was released in September 2022 to generally positive reviews. Our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated it 7.5 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Splatoon 3 may be the series’ best entry yet, featuring some nice gameplay tweaks and new weaponry, an expanded and polished story mode, and more launch content than its predecessors. That said, it’s very much an evolutionary sequel, every bit as iterative as many of the shooter franchises it’s meant to be an alternative to. After a five-year absence, that may not be enough for some. Splatoon 3 is still fun and funky, but Nintendo’s squid shooter series can’t get by on freshness alone forever.</em></p>



<p>However, fans of the third-person shooter series really enjoyed this entry. The game has sold over 12 million units to date, making it the fastest-selling Splatoon game.</p>



<p>80% of the shares of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore will be acquired on April 1, 2026, while the remaining ones will be purchased later, once the new subsidiary's operations have stabilized. BNSS will henceforth be known as Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
