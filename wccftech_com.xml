			<p><strong>FYQD</strong>, the one-man studio led by <strong>Zeng Xiancheng</strong> and known for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bright-memory-infinite-interview-zeng-on-raytracing-next-gen-and-december-target-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bright Memory Infinite</a></strong>, has announced a new game. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/FYQD_Studio/status/2006553505306489063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on X</a>, he said the currently untitled project is a third-person action shooter game set during the historical period of the <strong>Republic of China</strong>, 'amidst a time of turmoil and collapsing order, rival gangs clash in the shadows, as violence and conspiracy quietly spread through the streets.'</p>



<p>The Republic of China was formally established at the beginning of <strong>1912</strong>, following the <strong>Xinhai Revolution</strong> that ended <strong>over two thousand years of imperial history</strong>. It lasted until <strong>1949</strong>, when the Kuomintang-led government was ultimately defeated in the <strong>Chinese Civil War</strong> and forced to retreat to <strong>Taiwan</strong>, while the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> assumed control of the mainland and founded the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>.</p>



<p>It is certainly a unique setting for a videogame. Most titles set in China are based on much earlier eras, such as the <strong>Three Kingdoms (AD 220–280)</strong> (by far <a href="https://wccftech.com/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-to-launch-on-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most used setting in games</a>), the <strong>Tang Dynasty (618–907)</strong>, and the <strong>Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)</strong>. Indeed, when FYQD shared the news on the Chinese social network <strong>Bilibili</strong>, a user advised him 'not to touch' the subject matter, as 'getting involved with real history is never a good thing'. The Bright Memory Infinite developer replied:</p>



<p><em>The story and all aspects of this work are fictional and have no connection or association with actual historical events. It merely uses the Republican era as a background setting. The focus of the game is on third-person action shooting.</em></p>



<p>Depending on the story's depiction, it could indeed attract scrutiny from the Chinese government. However, FYQD is undoubtedly aware of that, and it does not sound like he's planning to make the game controversial.</p>

<p>The developer also posted a few gorgeous in-game screenshots of the game on social media. That's not much of a surprise, though, as his graphical skills were already shown in Bright Memory Infinite. Be prepared for a long wait, though: this seems to be a way more complex project.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio's previous game is now <strong>50% off on Steam</strong> and <strong>30% off on the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo stores</strong>. Over 90% of the global Steam user reviews are positive, and sales estimates based on SteamDB project a range between 1.18 million units and 2.32 million units sold on Valve's platform.</p>

			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was undeniably the defining game of 2025. For all the industry discussion it drove, to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">dominating performance at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, it was the one game that came out of nowhere and took over for the year. Not only did it win Game of the Year at The Game Awards, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">the winner at the <strong>Golden Joysticks</strong></a>, and the choice of several media outlets across the globe as they all picked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as well. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">ResetEra user Angie keeps an amazingly long and detailed thread of games during each awards season</a>, with several stats for anyone interested to dig through. Now that we're into 2026, the numbers for 2025's awards season have mostly been tallied, with <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting 291 Game of the Year wins in 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>That sets it just above Baldur's Gate 3, which was awarded 288 Game of the Year wins when it arrived in 2023. Ahead of it by a fairly large margin is The Last of Us Part II at 326, and ahead of everything by a country mile is Elden Ring with <strong>435 Game of the Year wins in 2022.</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the list, it'll be quite the event when/if something ever beats The Last of Us Part II and Elden Ring, since The Last of Us Part II is a solid 35 wins ahead of Clair Obscur, and Elden Ring is <strong>109 wins</strong> ahead of The Last of Us Part II. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of the 21 games with over 100 Game of the Year Wins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Elden Ring (FromSoftware) - 435</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part II (Naughty Dog) - 326</li>



<li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) - 291</strong></li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III (Larian Studios) - 288</li>



<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt Red) - 281</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo EPD) - 264</li>



<li>God of War (2018) (Santa Monica Studio) - 263</li>



<li>The Last of Us (Naughty Dog) - 257</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda) - 229</li>



<li>Astro Bot (Team Asobi) - 196</li>



<li>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (Naughty Dog) - 190</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Games) - 178</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games) - 163</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition (BioWare) - 139</li>



<li>Death Stranding (Kojima Productions) - 118</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarök (Santa Monica Studio) - 118</li>



<li>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (Naughty Dog) - 115</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo EPD) - 114</li>



<li>Overwatch (Blizzard Entertainment) - 114</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar Games) - 111</li>



<li>Mass Effect 2 (BioWare) -102</li>
</ol>



<p>This may not be the most 'official' list in the view of some people, but it is an interesting one to look at as a way to 'take the temperature' of what games media and game critics value and look toward as their picks for what is the best of the best each year. The top five, for example, are all single-player, story-driven experiences, with four out of five being fantasy-based RPGs. The only game in the top ten that's not fantasy-based, isn't largely narrative-driven, doesn't have RPG mechanics, and isn't an open-world game is 2024's Astro Bot with 196 wins.</p>



<p>In the top 21 listed, the only multiplayer-focused game is Overwatch in 19th place. Rockstar, Naughty Dog, BioWare, Santa Monica Studios, and Nintendo all have multiple titles on the list, with Naughty Dog leading the pack at four.</p>



<p>Multiplayer games may be the games people are going to daily, and the ones that sell the most each year, but it's clear that they are not the ones critics are looking to as the best-of-the-best each year.</p>



<p>As for Wccftech's pick of 2025's best, Clair Obscur was indeed <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our top ten Best Games for 2025</a>. It also made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Best Role-Playing games</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak for a solid hour with <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended Co-Creative Director and Lead Programmer Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, and he had a lot to reveal, including the studio's ongoing attempts to bring the game to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the previous slice of the gargantuan interview</a>, we focused on Stieglitz's confirmation that Unreal Engine 5.7 represents a massive performance boost in their testing. It is so massive, in fact, that the Nintendo Switch 2 port is only possible after the studio completes the engine upgrade to UE 5.7. The twist, however, is that even that alone won't be enough, which led Stieglitz to inform us that they are exploring ways to implement Frame Generation on the platform, utilizing either NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR 3.1. </p>



<p><em>Unreal Engine 5.7's performance boost is so extreme, in fact, that one of the reasons we had been working on it is that, on the side, we'd been exploring doing a Nintendo Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We actually have that running internally, and we found that <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 port was only doable with Unreal Engine 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant a performance improvement. So, we're really excited to get that one out.</em></p>



<p><em>I should note that the good news is <strong>the 5.7 improvements, they're not PC specific</strong>. Most of them apply to both consoles as well. So, we're really looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the <strong>Xbox</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> player base who, to this point, aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is, by our reckoning, <strong>a solid, unbreakable 60FPS is where we really want to be on those consoles</strong>. So, PlayStation and Xbox users have something to look forward to with that upgrade and not just PC users, but with Nintendo Switch 2 in particular... </em></p>



<p><em>We actually do have a working build of it and frankly, <strong>it was about half off where it needed to be performance-wise</strong>. Memory was actually very good, or I would say good enough. <strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 has, in effect, more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S</strong>, the so-called Lockhart platform, does. And so, since we already had basically scaled ARK: Survival Ascended for Series S, we found that we were in a better memory state than on that console and therefore weren't in a case of running out of memory on the Nintendo Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics on the Switch 2 than we do on the Series S. But the issue was the GPU primarily being weaker. We were able to use all the primary rendering features. Working on it, we wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that</strong>. We needed the game to look approximately like the Series X version or the PlayStation 5 version, even if it would be at a lower resolution. So, the issue was not core rendering features. We would have to do <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>Nanite</strong>, and <strong>Virtual Shadow Maps</strong>. All three of those things are important to us on Switch 2. I think we may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is kind of a slightly older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a lower resolution device like the Nintendo Switch 2, which for us would be a 1080p handheld 1440p docked resolution as opposed to 4K in either case. So Cascade shadows are good enough, but Lumen and Nanite, Nanite in particular with the large open world foliage scenes, were just hammering it very badly, and we were basically about half off of where we needed to be on the Nintendo Switch 2. </em></p>



<p><em>What does the Switch 2 version need? I mean, let's be clear, <strong>it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience</strong>. It's just not in the cards for Switch 2 with ARK: Survival Ascended. But the bottom line is, <strong>it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half off where we needed to be to get to that. That was prior to the Unreal Engine 5.7 test. We have found gains of about <strong>33 to 40% overall frame rate</strong>. It was completely GPU-bound, and it gains us about 33 to 40% off the GPU in those scenes. That was very, very good</em>, <em>but <strong>still not<br>where we need to be</strong> to get to a 30 FPS perceived frame rate solidly. </em></p>



<p><em>So, even the Unreal Engine 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. There's one last thing we're exploring right now. It's still an open question, which is why I can't say precisely when the game would come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, because it really requires getting to that solid core 30 FPS frame rate. Right now, just to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on UE 5.7. So, how do we get to a 30-plus FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with Frame Generation</strong>, but the truth is, I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. It's not yet supported by either <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, who makes the Switch 2 GPU, or <strong>AMD</strong>. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. So, we would have to port it ourselves, or work with them to do so. We've been just starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation is possible on the Switch 2, or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable. We don't know the answer. One of those I have to presume will be doable, hopefully. I mean, it's technology that should in theory work, especially AMD's, which is not hardware specific. That should be doable, but we would have to explore more of the ports. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of ARK: Survival Ascended. </em></p>



<p><em>Let me be frank, <strong>I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation</strong>. But if I can get to 20 to 25 without frame interpolation, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough. I don't think it'll look too smeary or too laggy if we're close to 30 without it. The reality is we're getting there. It's looking good and it's progressing, so I hope it's going to happen and be released this year and is impressive. </em></p>



<p>I then asked if the game would utilize NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, which the Nintendo Switch 2 definitely supports (although not every game takes advantage of it). Stieglitz said yes, while also adding that <strong>NVIDIA has been 'vague' about whether the hybrid console can support DLSS Frame Generation</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, DLSS works fine and is quite impressive. It helps quite a bit with the up-resing and image sharpening and clarity, but they separate the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the Frame Generation algorithm. What we've heard from NVIDIA is that they don't currently support Frame Generation on the Switch 2, but they've been a little vague about whether it can be supported. So, <strong>we have to poke them a little harder and try and get an answer on that in the new year</strong>.</em></p>



<p>To our knowledge, the platform does not support it; however, it's interesting to hear that Studio Wildcard did not receive a conclusive 'no' from NVIDIA. Needless to say, it could be a big deal for future game releases if the Nintendo Switch 2 supported some form of Frame Generation. We'll remain vigilant on the subject.</p>



<p>Lastly for the Nintendo Switch 2 portion of our ARK: Survival Ascended interview, Stieglitz confirmed that if it does come out on the console, it will join the same community of PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, unlike the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-evolved-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Nintendo Switch port of ARK: Survival Evolved</a>.</p>



<p><em>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2 (fingers crossed, and we are working on it), <strong>it would be a cross-platform, cross-multiplayer version of the game</strong>. It would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version of the game. The original Switch 1 version of ARK: Survival Evolved was unfortunately a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain, and I also think led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been by not connecting with the wider player base and not getting all the same content. We wouldn't be making that mistake again for the new version if it comes to pass.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for the rest of our chat with Jeremy Stieglitz on ARK: Survival Ascended's recently launched premium DLC, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a></strong>, and what's next for the popular survival game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store Saved You Over $550 With Its 2025 Holiday Daily Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/</link>
            <guid>1396084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Game Store's annual holiday daily giveaways have come to an end, and if you redeemed each of the games that were made free for 24 hours between December 18 and January 1 (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">Hogwarts Legacy on December 11</a>), you just saved over $550 by not having to buy those games.</p>



<p>The giveaway ended with Epic giving away two games on January 1, 2026, instead of one: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/"><strong>Wildgate</strong>, the PvP shooter from Dreamhaven that was released in 2025</a>, and <strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong>. With those two games, and the fact that the Trine Collection was technically four games in one single day, the Epic Games Store gave away <strong>20 games this past holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Totalling up the cost of the games at their non-discounted prices, you would have paid $567 USD to buy all of those games, including buying the four Trine games in a bundle as the Trine Collection. If you bought the Trine games individually, then the total goes up to $604.</p>



<p>That is not an insignificant amount of money saved if you're the kind of person who would have bought all of the games given away, which range in price and genre, from more narrative-driven and some smaller experiences that cost anywhere between $13-$30, to popular indies and even some triple-A titles costing between $40-$60. </p>



<p>Wildgate and Total War: Three Kingdoms will remain free for players to grab on the Epic Games Store until January 8, 2026, at which point the regular pace of one free game a week resumes, starting with Bloons TD 6.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games that were given away by Epic, starting on December 11, and then starting daily from December 18 through to January 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22)</li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>



<li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Dec. 25)</li>



<li>We Were Here Together (Dec. 26)</li>



<li>Cassette Beasts (Dec. 27)</li>



<li>SKALD Against the Black Priory (Dec. 28)</li>



<li>Viewfinder (Dec. 29)</li>



<li>Trine Collection (Dec. 30)</li>



<li>Chivalry 2 (Dec. 31)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Jan. 1)</li>



<li>Total War: Three Kingdoms (Jan. 1)</li>
</ul>



<p>It's all together, not a bad list of games. It's not the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1plsdrt/epic_games_christmas_free_game_giveaways_leaked/">fake list that appeared on Reddit</a> that seemed to gain traction based on how people would've genuinely loved it to be real. But it's not a terrible bunch of 20 games.</p>



<p>That said, what is unfortunate is that several of the titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">including The Callisto Protocol</a> and Chivalry 2, were games that you might've already grabbed for free as a previous Epic Games Store giveaway. So you're not always getting something new to add to your library if you use the Epic Games Store.</p>
