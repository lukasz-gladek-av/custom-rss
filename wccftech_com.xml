			<p>Atomic Heart's Mundfish had a third announcement at SGF 2025 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Heart II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a>: it will publish ILL, an intriguing survival horror game developed by Team Clout, headquartered in Cyprus. This is part of the new Mundfish Powerhouse publishing label <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Set in a mysterious research facility, ILL is a realistic first-person action/horror game that plunges players headlong into an immersive, atmospheric body horror narrative. Players can expect&nbsp;innovative gameplay mechanics, including a cutting-edge dismemberment system, binaural audio implementation, and realistic physics. ILL is a tribute to and an evolution of the survival horror genre.</p>
<p>Grotesque monsters can be mutilated and mercilessly torn apart. Ripped flesh, exposed bone, disemboweled bodies – all this will make an unprecedented impression and shock players. The binaural audio system aims to amplify the emotional impact.</p>
<p>Enemies are unpredictable, and the game's realistic physics makes the environment more than<br>
just a background. It becomes an active part of the gameplay of ILL, including during puzzle-solving.<br>
The player's actions can affect the behavior of monsters and cause unexpected reactions, from<br>
impulsive interaction with the surroundings to disturbingly human-like reflexes.</p>
<p>Players will feel the weight of weapons in their hands with elaborate animations that reflect their unique physical properties. Not only is precision necessary, but so is the maintenance of a diverse<br>
arsenal: checking for malfunctions, installing modifications, and upgrading. Strategic inventory<br>
management is critical to survival, as the ability to craft an item could literally mean the difference<br>
between life and death.</p>

<p>Some of Team Clout's developers have previously worked on horror movies like V/H/S/Beyond, Longlegs, IT: Welcome to Derry, and Azrael, which explains the game's cinematic vibe. ILL doesn't have a release date yet, but it can be wishlisted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Mundfish CEO Robert Bagratuni said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mundfish Powerhouse is proud to announce our partnership with Team Clout on their upcoming title, ILL. Powerhouse was created to empower daring, visionary developers by providing meaningful support where it matters most. We’re committed to backing artists with bold, transgressive, and uncompromising creative visions - and we believe ILL is a striking example of that spirit.</em></p>
