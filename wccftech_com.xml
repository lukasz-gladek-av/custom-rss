			<p>Hideo Kojima doesn't plan on stopping making video games even after he has passed away, as he will leave behind a USB stick with game ideas.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/">VGC</a>, the legendary game designer commented on his future as a creative, revealing that an unspecified illness he suffered during the pandemic, an eye operation and people around him passing away made him realize he was getting old, and wouldn't have all the time in the world to continue making games. This not only made him reevaluate his priorities, making him set aside the idea of directing a movie, but also convinced him to leave a USB stick with his ideas as some sort of will to Kojima Productions, which could continue making games even after he is gone, and not just stick to managing the IPs that have been created, including Physint, which is being made because Kojima-san realized a lot of people want him to make something like the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>In the latest issue of Edge Magazine, Hideo Kojima also commented on his next game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which is set to become more popular than its predecessor, going by the positive reception it is receiving in test reviews. The legendary game designer, however, is not entirely happy with this, as he would have liked the game to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">more controversial</a>, not desiring to make games with mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Though it will likely be more popular than its predecessor, there's no doubt Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be full of those trademark Hideo Kojima moments that make his games so unique. Thankfully, it won't be long until we can experience them ourselves, as the game launches on June 26th on PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>According to insider Dusk Golem, who is often well-informed about CAPCOM's roadmap, Resident Evil 9 should still be planned for a 2025 reveal and subsequent 2026 launch. Here's what the leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1922384237392523592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1922384237392523592%7Ctwgr%5E82e2561ec4f34e05178b2da1d63217fb52be56fe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-resident-evil-9-will-be-announced-this-year-1544383%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>It's almost 100% for sure being revealed this year and releasing next year. Doubt they'll delay more. The question comes if its being revealed this summer or at TGA for example this year, &amp; if its releasing this fiscal year (ending March 31st, 2026) or next fiscal year late 2026.</em></p>
<p>Dusk Golem previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-signapore-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Resident Evil 9 would be set on a Singapore-inspired island, more specifically in a rural town. The rural town setting was already explored in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Village, although of course, those took place in Spain and Romania, respectively. The Southeast Asian setting alone should provide some freshness.</p>
<p>Last year, Dusk Golem also <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that both Resident Evil 9 and Monster Hunter Wilds would be open world games. The latter was released in late February and was indeed an open world, so the insider was probably right about the next Resident Evil, too.</p>
<p>More recently, Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> why the new game is taking a long time. CAPCOM is reportedly reinventing the series and trying new things, much like it did with Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil VII. Fans shouldn't expect it to play like Resident Evil Village. Whether that means a return to third-person view remains to be seen.</p>
<p>When it comes to the reveal, there are a number of options for the publisher, from the Summer Game Fest taking place next month to Gamescom in August and then finally Tokyo Game Show in September. Of course, it's also possible for CAPCOM to play coy until The Game Awards in December, but that would likely mean a release window in the latter half of 2026.</p>

			<p>The Gears of War film adaptation has found its director. Deadline <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that David Leitch has been selected for the job; he's also expected to produce alongside Kelly McCormick, his wife and producing partner, via their 87North Productions and alongside game developer The Coalition. Leitch is known for movies like Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Fast &amp; Furious: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, Bullet Train, and The Fall Guy.</p>
<p>However, he won't be working on the Gears of War film right away. Leitch is currently in the pre-production phase of How to Rob a Bank, an upcoming bank robber movie featuring Nicholas Hoult, Anna Sawai, and ZoÃ« Kravitz. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<span>as originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-closer-to-fruition-after-bringing-on-board-dune-doctor-strange-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two years ago, Jon Spaihts (who is credited with Prometheus, Doctor Strange, Passengers, and the two Dune movies) is still&nbsp;writing the script for the Gears of War movie</span>.</p>
<p>The announcement of the adaptation <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-netflix-film-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came in November 2022</a>. The movie will be distributed on Netflix, which secured the rights at a time when gaming adaptations weren't so in demand. After the outstanding reception of The Last of Us and Fallout, though, there are more on the way, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mass Effect</a>.</p>
<p>As for new game installments in The Coalition franchise, there's a lot on the way. <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a> is a prequel set on Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde swarmed the surface of the planet Sera, featuring younger versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. It is being developed by People Can Fly alongside The Coalition; there's no release date yet, but we might very well learn more in a month during the yearly Xbox Games Showcase.</p>
<p>This Summer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will bring back the original game remastered and improved for the latest hardware. It will also mark the franchise's debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, now that Microsoft has shifted to a fully multiplatform strategy.</p>
