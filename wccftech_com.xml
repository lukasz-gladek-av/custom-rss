			<p>Silent Hill 2 continues to be not where it should be on a system like the PlayStation 5 Pro, and the improvements introduced in the latest patch released last week are not enough to significantly improve the game on the mid-generation console.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at how the game's aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-patch-1-06-playstation-5-pro/">1.06 patch</a> improves the game on PlayStation 5 Pro over the previous update, which introduced PSSR support that led to more issues than benefits in terms of visual quality. For the new patch, in Performance Mode, developer Bloober Team actually went back to TSR for Performance Mode, and the benefits are evident, as global illumination and reflections are more stable and less noisy, and there's no more massive disocclusion when moving the camera as in the previous version of the game. However, in general, image quality is not so different from the base model, and the slightly better performance may be due to the different cost of TSR over PSSR and not due to any actual improvement.</p>
<p>One thing that is very surprising in the latest version of Silent Hill 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro is that the game looks better in Performance Mode than in Quality Mode, as the latter still uses PSSR, which isn't a very good fit at the time for the types of visuals the game pushes. Performance is a little more stable than on the base model, but in terms of image quality, it still leaves a lot to be desired, requiring more work to actually get to the point where it should be on a system like the PS5 Pro.</p>

It's Complicated..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giugvMWCclY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technical issues aside, Silent Hill 2 is a more than worthy game to get not only for fans of the series but for any survival horror fan, as Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking what is widely considered one of the best entries in the Konami series.

			<p>The free-to-play third-person shooter game Star Wars: Hunters will debut soon <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842320/STAR_WARS_Hunters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, as announced yesterday by publisher Zynga (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-interactive-completes-merger-with-farmville-publisher-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a couple of years ago by Take-Two). Star Wars: Hunters debuted last June on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by British studio NaturalMotion, the game focuses on fast-paced 4v4 battles featuring a varied roster of characters to choose from: Ewok Grenadier Pilbush, Zabrak Archer Nox, Imperial Heavy Gunner Sentinel, Wookiee Juggernaught Grozz, Dark Side Assassin Rieve, Rodian Sawbones Skora, Mandalorian Vanguard Aran Tal, Twin Shield Droid K-AOS, Jedi Droid J-3DI, Jawa Scavenger Utooni, Unrelenting Bounty Hunter Imara Vex, Miraluka Sharpshooter Diago, Rebel War Hero Zaina, Mon Calamari Prodigy Sprocket, Droideka Speedster Slingshot, and Trandoshan Trapper Charr. Each character comes with their own weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Hunters currently features four modes: Squad Brawl, Dynamic Control, Power Control, and Trophy Chase. It was also supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/huttball-from-swtor-will-be-available-in-star-wars-hunters-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Star Wars: The Old Republic's unique Huttball mode, but it seems it was removed before the launch.</p>
<p>While the official PC launch is scheduled for January 27, interested players can sign up right now on the Steam page for the upcoming playtests, which will take place between December 13 and 16 and again between January 10 and 13. The best news, though, is that Star Wars: Hunters will feature full cross-play and cross-progression between all the available platforms. As such, you will be able to carry over your existing progress, provided you connect your Zinga ID account.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Hunters™ | PC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qubow1v9zFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main perk of the PC version will be enhanced graphics compared to the mobile platforms. Even so, the system requirements are very low, as you can see below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD FX-8320</em><br>
<em>Memory: 4 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 730 or AMD Radeon R7 240</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 4570 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon R9 270</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Recommended 4K:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p>The current plan is to launch Star Wars: Hunters out of early access at some point in the middle of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the span of a few hours, two promising projects from former Mass Effect developers were abruptly halted. Both were sci-fi titles that fans hoped could be reminiscent of BioWare's acclaimed RPG saga.</p>
<p>The first one, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two days ago, was Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin studio, which had to be shut down due to a sudden lack of funding. A few hours ago, Mac Walters announced similar news (though not as dire) for his Worlds Untold studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Mac Walters, a writer on Mass Effect 3 and game director on Andromeda and the Legendary Edition compilation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Worlds Untold last year with funding from NetEase. That's the problem: they have split with NetEase and are now seeking another partner. In the meantime, work on the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life. This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together. </em><em>In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I’m deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we’ve had together at Worlds Untold. While we’re pausing for now, this isn’t goodbye—there’s more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>We interviewed former Mass Effect writer and director Mac Walters last year as part of the news announcement, and we learned that the project would be more of an action/adventure title rather than an RPG, more story-driven and linear.</p>
<p><em>I've done RPGs and I love them, but I wanted to do something that led with story. It's an action RPG but with a lot of story and as much as we were always able to blend that into the RPG choose-your-own-adventure style, I really like the idea of telling something that's perhaps a little bit more linear. It looks at choice and consequence and things like that but in a different light.</em></p>
<p><em>I was also looking at some of the games that I had enjoyed recently, whether it was The Last of Us, Uncharted, or Tomb Raider that I get kind of get swept away in. I really wanted to focus on building a game that allowed me to tell a great adventure story.</em></p>
<p>We wish Walters and all the Worlds Untold team members involved the very best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Has Sold Over 30 Million Units, Says CDPR]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during their financial report for Q3 2024, CD Projekt RED announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now surpassed 30 million units sold, while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, has sold 8 million in around a year.</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CDPR, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In less than four years since release, we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year, it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year, the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips.</em></p>
<p>Despite the controversial launch that featured many bugs and issues, especially on consoles, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of all time, following up on what was arguably the best game of the previous generation - The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. As such, even with all those caveats, it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest digital launch ever</a>, with an estimated 10.2 million units by January 2021. Sales probably slowed down for a while after that due to word of mouth and the fact that Sony outright removed the game from its PlayStation Store for several months.</p>
<p>However, CD Projekt RED's constant updates completely turned around the reception, culminating in the release of Update 2.0 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. All this work paid off, allowing what was already a rough diamond to properly shine. The sales are only the obvious consequence.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Cyberpunk 2077 that performed well for the Polish studio, as The Witcher 3 continues to sell even nine years after its launch. Overall, total revenue amounted to $55.7 million, while the company registered a consolidated net profit of $19 million.</p>
<p>The other big news of the day was, as already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the announcement that The Witcher 4 (codenamed Project Polaris) is officially in full-scale production. On this, Nowakowski said:</p>
<p><em>I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its own North American-based team</a>, so work on that game continues separately. However, it's clear that most of CDPR's attention will be on the upcoming The Witcher game for the next few years.</p>
