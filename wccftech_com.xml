			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> with several bugs and issues, which GSC Game World, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the million units sold milestone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-team-outlines-next-fixes-crashes-bugs-weapon-price-adjustments-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>One of the main features that need care is the so-called A-Life AI and spawn system. While we wait to see if the developer will be able to fix it with an official patch, modder ConnerRia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a mod called The Roadside Panic that aims to greatly improve the lively feeling of the Zone - although it might just kill your game's frame rate in the process. Here's the official overview from the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>This mod restores the chaotic dynamism of the old STALKER games. It also murders your frame rate, so you can enjoy the authentic 30fps 2007 Shadow Of Chernobyl gameplay experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unleashes the full potential of online A-Life</em></li>
<li><em>Heavily mitigates cases of enemies appearing out of thin air right behind you, like in that Reddit clip of the military base everyone keeps talking about</em></li>
<li><em>Significant extension of the A-Life range. NPC and NPC interactions can be seen and heard from afar.</em></li>
<li><em>Different factions will fight for territory at POIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How Did You Fix "A-Life"?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Duct-tape. The AI director in STALKER 2 is actually very complex internally, however its function is gimped because of severe bugs compounding each other. I troubleshooted the present bugs to the extent of my ability and duct-taped a solution to coax the A-Life system into working around its own field of anomalies, so to speak. However, a couple of other issues with the A-Life system are breaking it and causing not only janky behavior but also flat-out non-existent A-Life simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod should prevent or at least mitigate abrupt spawns and it will also deliver immersive A-Life interactions such as NPC-NPC firefights, of course.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What's The Catch?</em></strong><br>
<em><strong>Performance.</strong> This mod will slaughter your frames in an already unoptimized game. A top-of-the-line CPU is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Persisting Spawn Issues.</strong> As said before, the director is broken, and all a-life cfg tweaks are doing is finding brute-force methods to circumvent said issues to get more spawns and world events.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Roadside Panic - Stalker 2 A-Life Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e472boNXfIs?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this mod, you can pick between three download options. The first, Roadside Panic, works at a radius of 800 meters but keeps the squad density of STALKER 2 as-is. The second, called Roadside Panic Lite, works in a 250-meter radius to mitigate bugs. If you're feeling really brave, though, the option for you is Roadside Panic, which works in an 800-meter radius but also cranks up the spawns a lot.</p>
<p>If you opt to try Roadside Panic, let us know in the comments about your experience.</p>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition-footage-system-requirements/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> mod is almost complete, and the unofficial remaster should be released before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Together with launching a new story-focused trailer, which doesn't feature interior lighting that will be added to the final version of the mod, Revolution Team confirmed that development is 95% complete and is now at the final testing stage. The developer discovered some unforeseen bugs that require fixing, so the mod's release may slip to January 2025, as they want to release the most functional version of the mod possible. Still, they are doing everything they can to get the Nextgen Edition of one of the best entries in the series out before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition mod has been in the works for some time, so it's definitely good to hear that development is almost over, as it is setting out to be one of the best ways to experience the classic open-world game developed by Rockstar Games complete with visuals and gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Those who cannot play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition are still able to experience a remastered version of the game with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition remasters. The compilation was updated <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">earlier this month</a> with some enhancements only available for the mobile version of the compilation up until this month that address some of the issues of the PC and console release. You can learn more about it and the issues that plagued it at launch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
