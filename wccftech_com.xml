			<p>Obsidian's classic RPG Fallout: New Vegas is about to get an influx of players, to be sure. The second season of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV show will be available on Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting on Wednesday, December 17</a>, and its setting is indeed New Vegas, as the main characters pursue the traitorous former overseer of Vault 33, Hank MacLean, toward the city. Since the show takes place fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, those who have never experienced the masterpiece game would do well to play it before the TV show airs.</p>



<p>Just in case you need further incentive, a new graphics mod has just been released, and a quest mod will launch a few days before the TV show's second season. The graphics mod, called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94521?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies</a>, was created by doodlum, the main coder behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders</a>. </p>



<p>The modder calls this 'the ultimate clouds mod' and explains that the default game and previous mods previously used clouds from real-world pictures. Perfect Skies, on the other hand, uses computer-generated clouds, avoiding issues such as pixelation and other visual artifacts. Moreover, doodlum developed a proprietary cloud baking system and boasts that it is more advanced than the one featured in Fallout 4 (which launched four years after Fallout: New Vegas and is celebrating its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new edition that comes out today</a>). Perfect Skies features 30 unique cloud variations and 60 4K textures, making up nearly 1GB of cloud textures. That said, the textures are compressed, so the file size is only 220MB.</p>

<p>The quest mod is called Fallout: Long 15 and takes the player character into NCR territory, entering California through Interstate 15. According to the modding team (which already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a similar mod</a> for the Legion faction called Dry Wells), Long 15 features a huge new worldspace, complete with new quests, factions, and towns. The modders, who have a Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TheLong15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">page</a>, aim to launch Long 15 on Friday, December 12. A new story trailer will go live between late November and early December.</p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Game Director Daniel Vávra <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized The Outer Worlds 2</a>, adding that Obsidian hasn't successfully innovated since the days of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>
