			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/">Insider-Gaming</a>, Ubisoft has another live service game in development following its shutdown of XDefiant, which will be gone forever this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">June 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The report claims that this game will be a battle royale and is currently in development under the codename "Scout. "One of Insider-Gaming's sources says that "<em>I think the goal is to capitalize on the player count of Apex dropping and them [Ubisoft higher-ups] thinking there's room in the market for another hero Battle Royale.</em>"</p>
<p>This, of course, isn't Ubisoft's first crack at adding another successful live service title to its portfolio. Rainbow Six is arguably the most significant live service success it has, but that's still a paid title, and not a free-to-play game. Ubisoft's track record is very different in terms of its free-to-play successes.</p>
<p>Out of its current free-to-play offerings, it is easy to imagine that Brawlhalla is the most successful, though Ubisoft's longest-running free-to-play game is the PC-only MMO sandbox Growtopia. Last year's summer release, Battle Core Arena, Rocksmith+, Roller Champions, Trackmania, and Rabbids Coding are also listed on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/games/free">Ubisoft's website</a> as part of its free-to-play lineup. If these games are doing amazingly well for Ubisoft, the company certainly isn't discussing those successes.</p>
<p>Of course, XDefiant used to be on that list, but it was long removed after last year's closing announcements. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hyper-scape/">Hyper Scape</a> is another free-to-play title that, just like XDefiant, didn't last. Right now, it's difficult to see whatever this project Scout ends up becoming, having a different fate than either XDefiant or Hyper Scape.</p>
<p>Battle royales are also not the new, exciting genre they once were in the free-to-play, live service world. Sure, the biggest ones are still very popular. No one is dethroning Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, or PUBG anytime soon. If anything, you could argue that XDefiant's attempt at bringing back an old-school flavor of multiplayer was what had a better shot at breaking through the live service ceiling.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft had let the game run for at least a calendar year and supported it differently, XDefiant might have ended up on the rise after the drop-off from its launch success. If this rumored project makes it to PCs and consoles, we'll see if Ubisoft is willing to give it that chance.</p>

			<p>During a wide-ranging interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Variety</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer also discussed the success of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The executive appeared to hint at the potential for a sequel, but he also made it clear that he'd like Microsoft-owned studios to work first and foremost on owned franchises (which Indiana Jones is obviously not, being licensed by Disney).</p>
<p><em>I will say, we’re really happy with “Indy” and the players and the reception. We do think there’s life in that franchise, and I’m just gonna leave it at that. We’re launching on PlayStation here pretty soon. I think that’ll be a cool moment. I was really inspired by Machine Games taking someone else’s IP and doing something so unique, and I’m inspired about what that team can do next. Certain people were kind of pushing them on the first person versus third person. And I think once you play it, you realize you are Indy. But going forward, I also want to give the teams the ability to do our own games and our own franchises. We have a lot of room to tell new stories, as well. And I want to make sure that’s an option for us.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just launched on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, around four months after its debut on PC and Xbox Series S|X. PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers the best way to play the game on consoles</a>, although the PC version with path tracing enabled remains superior for those with the hardware to run it.</p>
<p>A story DLC called The Order of Giants is scheduled to be released later this year. Of course, a full-fledged sequel is what fans really want after playing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent base game</a>. It sounds like it could happen, provided that Disney reaches a deal with Microsoft.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date and trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">Star Wars Outlaw's</a> next DLC expansion, A Pirate's Fortune, have leaked online ahead of its scheduled reveal during Star Wars Celebration tomorrow, with the currently unlisted trailer appearing on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-reveal-trailer-launches-on-may-15th.1167036/">ResetEra</a>. Since publishing, Ubisoft has taken the trailer down.</p>
<p>Both the trailer and the video's description spoil the surprise that players will be able to step back into the boots of Kay Vess and experience an adventure with fan-favorite character Hondo Ohnaka on <strong>May 15, 2025</strong>, with the DLC including its own season pass, just as the first DLC, Wild Card, did.</p>
<p>A press release from Ubisoft also reveals that a demo for Star Wars Outlaws will be made available starting today on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The demo will be approximately three hours long, featuring "<em>parts</em>" of the full game, hinting that you'll likely get to jump around in the game's story so you can experience major aspects like open-world exploration, ship battles, and stealth missions. Save data from the demo will not carry over to the full game, should you choose to pick it up.</p>
<p>The new expansion will also feature cosmetic items inspired by the recent television series Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a trophy for the speeder, and trinkets for your speeder and Kay's ship, the Trailblazer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This new trailer doesn't reveal too much about the story for A Pirate's Fortune, only that you'll be pitted against Stinger Tash and her band of Rokana Raiders while you race against them to do a bit of tomb raiding in the Khepi Tomb.</p>
<p>A Pirate's Fortune is the second of two planned DLCs for Star Wars Outlaws, after which Ubisoft is likely to announce that it has moved on to future projects, especially when considering that, by Ubisoft's admission, Outlaws did not have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">commercial performance</a> Ubisoft was expecting from it.</p>
