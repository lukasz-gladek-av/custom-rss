			<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> went through a <strong>deep identity crisis</strong> following the glorious 16-bit entries in the series. The transition to <strong>3D gameplay</strong> wasn't smooth at all, and the <strong>many experiments conducted by Team Sonic weren't always successful.</strong> </p>



<p>2022's <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sonic Frontier</em> is, in my opinion, among those experiments that</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">succeeded,</strong></a> as, even with some issues, the game did a great job <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">capturing the spirit of the franchise</strong> while trying to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">push the formula in a new direction</strong>. SEGA and Team Sonic, apparently, share my sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Known and reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong>, who has an <strong>excellent track record</strong> with many early reveals (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">including the Switch 2 official announcement date last year</a></strong>) <strong><a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013707082789237065#m">replied to an X user question</a></strong> regarding the <strong>next entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series</strong>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Did you like Frontiers?</em>" the leaker replied, leaving <strong>little doubt about the direction of the yet-to-be-announced game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is generally regarded as a solid entry in the series, the community seems divided on a hypothetical <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sonic Frontiers 2</em>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Hopefully the artstyle is more cartoonish. Frontiers felt too much like one of those "Mario in UE5" type videos,"</em> said Reddit user KittenDecomposer96 on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qif3a7/natethehate_seemingly_says_the_next_sonic_game/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"I really felt like they dropped Sonic on a generic UE5 terrain and randomly sprinkled some Sonic elements over the place,"</em> agreed Phos-Lux, echoing the wider community sentiment.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The evolution of Sonic Frontiers' open-world gameplay</strong>, however, is making other fans <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">excited</strong> about the possibilities. <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"They could make it open world and connect the areas, let us actually see Sonic's world properly,</em>" said Phos-Lux, highlighting well what Team Sonic could do for the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>As the identity crisis I mentioned above often led Team Sonic to almost completely discard gameplay formulas in favor of others, I would definitely welcome the developer <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">iterating on and improving the Frontiers open-world formula</strong>. While the game's plot justified the generic visual identity of the open world, I couldn't help by wonder how much better the game would have been if it had the colorful cartoonish visuals that have defined the series, no matter the quality of each game.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the next Sonic the Hedgehog game will play, it hopefully won't take much longer to know <strong>what's next for the franchise. </strong>2026 marks the series' <strong>35th Anniversary</strong>, and its celebrations would be perfect to unveil what's next for it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties to Get Demo Today; System Requirements Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-get-demo-system-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1411624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> and <strong>SEGA</strong> have announced that a free <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> demo will be released later today on all platforms, albeit at different times. The PC version will get it first, at <strong>7 AM Pacific Time</strong>, while the console versions for Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for download at <strong>9 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike other recent demos, users <strong>won't be able to carry over their save data to the full game</strong>, so it's really just a way to try the game before purchase. RGG Studio and SEGA have also outlined which sections have been prepared for the demo:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore <strong>Ryukyu</strong> in <strong>Okinawa</strong> as <strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong>, beating down bad guys and dynamically switching between the brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style and the weapon-based Ryukyu style. Players can also indulge in immersive side experiences such as karaoke, sub-stories, and outfit customisation.</li>



<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy <strong>an all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine</strong> and explore <strong>Kamurocho</strong>, experiencing a variety of activities while also mastering Mine's shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced at the <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong></a> in September. According to the developers, this is <strong>an 'extreme' remake</strong> of the third mainline installment in the series, which originally launched in 2009 for PlayStation 3 and later appeared on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Additionally, there's new content in the form of Dark Ties, which is centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, <strong>it is a prequel</strong> in which Mine willingly plunges into the dark world of the Yakuza after losing everything. Driven by the pursuit to find true bonds, he embarks on a dramatic journey coloured by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will be released <strong>on February 12, 2026</strong> for all the aforementioned platforms. Pre-orders are already available, too, and pre-order customers will receive the bonus item Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga that adds the fan-favorite character <strong>Ichiban Kasuga</strong> (protagonist of the more recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon</a></strong> games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang.</p>



<p>As part of the demo news, the Steam store page was also updated with the <strong>official PC system requirements</strong>, which we've added below.</p>

			<p>Polish developer <strong>Questline</strong> and publisher <strong>Awaken Realms</strong> have announced that the open world first-person action RPG <strong>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</strong>, affectionately called <em>'<strong>Indie Skyrim</strong>'</em> by its fans, has now sold <strong>more than one million units</strong> across all platforms.</p>



<p>To celebrate the news, they have released a special trailer and kicked off a <strong>20% limited-time discount</strong> on <strong>Steam</strong>. The discount applies to all items on the store page, including the base game (down to <strong>$35.99</strong> from the original price of <strong>$44.99</strong>), the Sanctuary of Arras expansion that launched last month (now priced at <strong>$11.99</strong> instead of <strong>$14.99</strong>), the Adventure Pack that includes both (down to <strong>$47.98</strong> from <strong>$59.98</strong>), and even the Supporters Pack, which provides access to the official soundtrack and artbook, now for <strong>$7.99</strong> instead of <strong>$9.99</strong>. This promotion will end on Sunday, February 1. </p>

<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in December 2021, following the success of <strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong>, a deck-building/roguelike/RPG hybrid. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't so fond of his experience with The Fall of Avalon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as you can read in the review</a>, but the user reception on Steam is great, with a review rating of 86% for recent reviews and 88% for overall reviews.</p>



<p>Given the successful launch, it is likely that Questline and Awaken Realms will work on a bigger, more polished sequel, though it may be a long time before it materializes. We'll keep you apprised of any news from the developer and publisher.</p>
