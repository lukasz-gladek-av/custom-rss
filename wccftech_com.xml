			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> has <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially been published</a> by the <strong>Game Developers Conference (GDC)</strong>, which surveyed over <strong>2,300</strong> <strong>developers</strong> in an attempt to put a finger on the pulse of the game industry, asking developers about a range of topics, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/">Generative AI</a></strong>, the epidemic of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">mass industry layoffs</a></strong>, which kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">video games are dominating the industry</a>, and more.</p>



<p>When reading the report, it's always worth remembering that there are hundreds of thousands of developers not surveyed here, and that with GDC updating its survey process every year, it doesn't present a complete picture of where the industry is at. That said, just like how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">SteamDB</a></strong> numbers don't show the full picture of an individual game's success, that doesn't mean the information is useless.</p>



<p>Information like how, among developers surveyed by GDC, <strong>1-in-4 have been laid off in the last two years</strong>, and out of those laid off developers, <strong>nearly half of them are still struggling to find a job</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>According to our survey, 17% of game industry professionals reported being laid off in the past 12 months, while 11% said they were laid off during the 12 months prior (lining up with our 2025 survey data). Altogether, that means over one-fourth (28%) of respondents have experienced a layoff in the past two years, increasing to one-third (33%) for those in the United States</em>," the report reads. </p>



<p>"<em>Of those who’ve experienced a layoff, almost half (48%) said they haven’t found another job yet. This includes 36% of game industry professionals who were laid off 1 to 2 years ago."</em></p>



<p>Industry churn and layoffs are an unfortunate reality for any industry; game developers certainly aren't alone in experiencing turbulent times in their industry of choice. But layoffs are short-term, band-aid solutions that only make a positive impact on a company's bottom line, while making a negative impact everywhere else. </p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been laid off so many times in the last 5-6 years, had so many turbulent issues working in games. I have trauma and <strong>can’t ever fully trust anywhere now</strong></em>," said one of the developers surveyed. <strong>23%</strong> of those surveyed anticipate layoffs in the coming year, and another <strong>30%</strong> remain unsure. That's a majority of developers who can't say with certainty that they'll have job stability, even if they know they are good at what they do.</p>



<p>"<em>The market has been so challenging I’m not sure I’ll remain in games</em>," said another respondent. Meanwhile, the next class of developers currently in school looking to join the industry don't see much hope for their own prospects. <strong>3-in-4 game development students surveyed are concerned they won't be able to find a job</strong>, while <strong>87% of their teachers surveyed</strong> believe their students will struggle to find work.</p>



<p>When companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/">Meta</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-layoffs-nearly-all-areas-western-offices/">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon,</a></strong> to name just a few, lay off their employees by the tens, hundreds, and thousands at a time, not only are those companies and their teams losing talented developers, but each layoff is one more traumatizing event that might make someone decide they won't come back to games. Young developers coming into the industry lose proper mentorship because there aren't any veterans around to mentor them, and the developers who survive each layoff are left with more work to be done in less time, leading to more crunch and developer burnout. None of those things contributes to an industry that can produce better and more entertaining games for players.  </p>



<p>As one particularly blunt student put it, "<em>There aren't any jobs. Everyone's getting fired. It's f***ed."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has debuted a new gameplay overview trailer for <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>, the long-awaited open-world action adventure game that began its life as a completely different game from what will launch on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">March 19, 2026</a></strong>. The 15-minute-long showcase highlights the game's story, which follows its protagonist <strong>Kliff</strong>, and shows off the five distinct regions of Pywel, the game's vast open-world setting.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">When Pearl Abyss first revealed Crimson Desert</a>, the plan was for it to be an MMORPG for the next generation of consoles and PCs. That was seven years ago, and the next-gen is now the current-gen, and just a year into that plan, Pearl Abyss decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/"><strong>entirely overhaul the direction of the game</strong>.</a> After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple delays</a></strong>, the team is finally ready to release the single-player open-world adventure, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/">just last week confirmed that the game had officially "<em><strong>gone gold</strong></em>."</a></p>



<p>Today's new overview, which you can check out below, is an in-depth look at the game's story, which follows Kliff, a Greymane warrior who fights to protect the innocent and his fellow Greymanes like they're his own family. Our story with Kliff begins shortly after the peace he and his fellow Greymanes were enjoying is shattered, and he embarks on a journey to take back his homeland and reunite his lost Greymanes, but within that quest, he discovers a darker conspiracy at play.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That darker element is the Abyss, a realm that holds incredible amounts of power, power that some are looking to exploit, which further drives the Abyss towards imbalance and threatens to harm the rest of the world if Kliff can't put a stop to it first.</p>



<p>Nothing about the story seems necessarily groundbreaking, but that's perfectly fine so long as it's executed well. Besides, while the game's narrative might be the vehicle that carries players through the land of Pywel, the engine driving everything is its wide exploration and gameplay variety.</p>



<p>You'll be able to explore five regions that make up the setting of Pywel: <strong>Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia </strong>and the<strong> Crimson Desert</strong>. Each region has its own stories and environment, with players being free to explore the world of Pywel in any order they choose.</p>



<p>The overview also shows off the two other playable characters beyond Kliff, which you'll unlock as the story progresses. It also features a quick look at the mix of fantasy and sci-fi embedded within Crimson Desert, since you'll be able to jump from classic sword and shield medieval combat to flying around in a giant missile-launching mech.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Pearl Abyss has packed a lot into Crimson Desert, and today's overview didn't even go too in-depth on the game's combat. For more on Crimson Desert, and to keep an eye on everything happening with the game as we near its release date, and beyond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/">check out our dedicated page for the game with everything you need to know about it.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> showcases planned for the <strong>studio's 35th anniversary</strong></a> is dedicated to its golden goose, the 21-year-old MMORPG <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>. The so-called <strong>State of Azeroth</strong> livestream opened with Executive Producer <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> revealing that, in the first two weeks of early access to <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>'s new <strong>Housing</strong> feature, players <strong>spent over four million hours in player housing</strong> (450 cumulative years, basically) and <strong>placed more than 14 million décor items</strong> in their new homes. So far, the most popular item was the Secretive Bookcase Wall.</p>



<p>Longdale then switched to talk a bit about <strong>WoW Classic</strong>, which is currently at the <strong>Mists of Pandaria</strong> expansion. The next major update, the <strong>Escalation</strong> patch, will be released in a few weeks, introducing a new quest campaign, the Battlefield: Barrens world event, the new Challenge Cards system and new bosses in the Brawler's Guild, four new scenarios and Heroic scenarios, and progression to the Legendary questline. Later this year, WoW Classic players can look forward to the arrival of the Siege of Orgrimmar and Timeless Isle. Meanwhile, the launch of <strong>The Burning Crusade Classic</strong> on the <strong>Anniversary Realms</strong> is very close, featuring iconic Outlands content.</p>



<p>The State of Azeroth livestream then featured Senior Game Director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong>, who appeared to outline the roadmap <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the March 2, 2026 launch of the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Ascension</strong> is a repeatable pre-launch event running until March 2, in which players join Magister Umbric and Grand Magister Rommath to repel <strong>Twilight's Blade</strong>, a splinter faction of Twilight's Hammer operating primarily in the Twilight Highlands. The cult performs large ritual events to summon rare elite bosses around the zone, which players must interrupt and defeat. By participating, players can earn limited-time rewards like pets, mounts, transmogs, and housing décor.</li>



<li><span>This week, Blizzard is also kicking off another limited-time event called&nbsp;<strong>Winds of Mysterious Fortune,</strong>&nbsp;in which experience gains when using characters between level 10 and 80 are boosted by 20%, and reputation gains, regardless of character level, are boosted by 5</span>0%. Additionally, quests and monster kills for leveling characters have a chance to award the player a so-called <strong>Mysterious Satchel</strong>, which can contain gear, cosmetics, and potions. It's a way to help returning players or existing players who are leveling alternate characters (commonly called ALTs).</li>



<li>On that note, there's also a <strong>Welcome Back Weekend</strong> live now. Former players with a lapsed subscription can enjoy free access to World of Warcraft until Sunday, February 1, with leveling up available up to 80.</li>



<li>The developers are giving away a unique <strong>Dark Portal</strong> décor item to active subscribers who log in between now and the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</li>
</ul>



<p>After recapping <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main features of the expansion</a>, Hazzikostas then moved to provide fresh details on the post-launch roadmap. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season One</strong> will kick off a couple of weeks after March 2, introducing the 6-boss <strong>Voidspire raid</strong>, the single-boss <strong>Dreamrift mini-raid</strong>, four world bosses, a Mythic+ pool consisting of 4 Midnight and 4 returning legacy dungeons, a new Delve season, and a PvP season.</li>



<li><strong>March on Quel’Danas</strong>, another 2-boss raid zone, is scheduled to open a few weeks after Season 1 begins to cap off the expansion's initial story chapter.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.0.5</strong>, which goes to the Public Test Realm shortly after the launch of the expansion, is set to introduce global <strong>Void Assaults</strong> to the outdoor world and a lighthearted "Prop Hunt" inspired event featuring a new 5v5 mini-game located in Silvermoon City.</li>



<li><span><strong>Patch 12.0.7</strong>&nbsp;will further escalate</span> Void Assaults and introduce a standalone single-boss raid called <strong>Sporefall</strong> to experiment with a more frequent raiding cadence.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1</strong> is going to be a major content update featuring a large new outdoor questing zone, a new raid, a new dungeon, new Delves, a new world boss, a Mythic+ refresh, and a complete overhaul of the <strong>Friend System</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1.5</strong>, slated to go live alongside BlizzCon 2026, adds <strong>Labyrinths</strong> (which are mega-dungeon-inspired sprawling Delve experiences), another small narrative-themed raid that will set the stage fo what's coming in 2027, and an experimental standalone mode from the creators of <strong>Plunderstorm</strong> (the Pirate-themed Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-plunderstorm-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that launched two years ago</a>) and <strong>Remix</strong>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Hazzikostas also unveiled some of the improvements coming to the Housing feature, including <strong>copy/paste functionality</strong>, <strong>mass-select</strong> for moving complex structures, and the ability to share designs via <strong>import/export codes</strong>. Décor budgets will also slowly increase, both for interiors and exteriors, as Blizzard irons out technical limitations and provides players with a sense of progression as they grow their homes. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2026 State of Azeroth | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkFMkdZWxdk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Future updates will allow players to place companion pets within their homes and hitch favorite mounts in their outdoor yards. With the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight, the <strong>Neighborhood Endeavors</strong> feature will go live as well, and the team plans to use it to monitor player behaviour and inform future updates.</p>



<p>Last but not least, the Senior Game Director teased that <strong>BlizzCon 2026, the studio's convention that returns after three years, will be 'one for the ages' </strong>where Blizzard is going to unveil <strong>its plans for the next 20 years of the Warcraft franchise</strong>. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlizzCon 2026</a> will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on September 12 and 13. According to the latest rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-person-starcraft-shooter-will-reportedly-be-unveiled-at-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> <strong>will reveal a third-person StarCraft shooter during the keynote</strong></a>.</p>
