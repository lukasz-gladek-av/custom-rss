			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> was supposed to be feature complete, with no major updates coming our way since 2021, but it turns out it's hard to keep a game that's sold nearly 50 million units down. A couple months back, Nintendo made the surprise announcement that Animal Crossing: New Horizons would be receiving a <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid Nintendo Switch 2 update, as well as a free 3.0 update</a> adding new content and long-requested quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Do these updates justify returning to your (perhaps-long-neglected) island? Or is it not worth the trouble to even squash the cockroaches in your house? Sail on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing20.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's begin with the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition as it’s the update with an actual price tag, albeit a reasonable $5 one. The game, which suffered from fairly obvious jaggies on the OG Switch, now looks much crisper as it runs at 4K while docked (likely 1440p boosted to 4K using DLSS like most Switch 2 upgrades). Everything just has nice sharp edges now, which really benefits a lot of the intricately-detailed small objects and props in the game, but, of course, there is a limit to how transformed a game with Animal Crossing's visual style is going to be by a resolution bump (I would have perhaps liked to see HDR support too).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing21.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 upgrade also comes with a few other assorted additions, like mouse controls for drawing patterns and the ability to call out villager's names using the built in mic. There are also some improvements that simply come with the more modern hardware, like faster load times (a boon considering how much of a pain they were previously). That said, you're mainly paying for the visual fidelity boost, which I do think most people will find worthwhile at the price of a Big Mac, but that's up to you.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing22.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arguably more interesting, at least from a new content perspective, is the 3.0 update, which, again, is available for free for both Switch 1 and 2 players. The big addition is the Hotel, which pops up on the pier and is run by Kapp'n and his reptilian pirate crew. Players are asked to design hotel rooms based on certain themes, with the game providing some items to fit those themes, and are rewarded with tickets that can be traded at the Hotel's shop for exclusive items. If this sounds very much like a stripped-down version of the not-that-keenly-remembered Happy Home Paradise DLC, well, that's because that’s basically what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing23.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Hotel is a fine addition for those who just can't get enough decorating, but there's no real challenge to it -- you can craft the perfect themed hotel rooms if you want, but you can also just slap more-or-less whatever together and still earn your tickets. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the hotel is that it attracts a steady stream of new animals to your island, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your temperament. On the one hand, some fresh blood! On the other hand, some folks who have very specifically curated their island's vibes and population may not enjoy all these new weirdos wandering around (I’m a YIMBY island manager myself).</p>



<p>The other big content addition are "Slumber Islands" -- essentially spare islands you can tinker with to your heart's desire, which, again, is great for the designers out there who just want more, more, more space for their designing, but they likely won’t be a game-changer for those who come to Animal Crossing for other things.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing24.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the other 3.0 changes fall under the umbrella of QoL improvements, such as the ability to further expand your storage and craft directly using items in said storage, greatly reducing the amount of inventory juggling required. You can also now craft items in batches, activate a grid for designing outdoors, and get Mr. Resetti to clean up the junk on your island. All these changes are straightforward positives, with Mr. Resetti being particularly helpful for me, as my son has turned parts of my island into a bit of a hoarder’s paradise. Honestly, some may lightly curse Nintendo for not adding some of these features earlier.</p>



<p>Oh, and another thing! After being missing in action since the Gamecube days, you can again collect classic Nintendo consoles that actually allow you to play real retro games within New Horizons. Unfortunately, the implementation leaves a bit to be desired, as the selection of games is thin, light on bangers, <em>and </em>requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to work. Come on Nintendo, you couldn't have just given loyal Animal Crossing fans Clu Clu Land and Ice Climbers as freebies?</p>

<h2 id="h-a-final-form-on-the-horizon"><strong>A Final Form on the Horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and the 3.0 update don't alter the vibes or scope of this well-worn game in any serious way, but their addition results in a more complete-feeling total package. Long-requested quality-of-life improvements are here, gameplay from the oft-ignored Happy Home Paradise DLC has essentially been folded into the main game, and everything looks sharp as a tack. Personally, I'm more interested in seeing where the Animal Crossing series sails off to next, but these updates ought to make your remaining days in this particular paradise more playable and pleasant than previous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update is available to download now on Switch 1 and 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade can be purchased for $5.</p>

			<p>Ever since <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em><strong> launched</strong> on PlayStation 5 almost two years ago, fans of the series have been wondering <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/"><strong>how different </strong></a><em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</a></strong></em> will be, both in gameplay and technical terms. While we don't yet know how the <strong>Highwind airship</strong> will shape traversing the entirety of the game's world, we have now learned something that is sure to make many breathe a sigh of relief: <strong>the game won't use Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking with <strong>Gamespot</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the engine powering part 3. <em>"We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. <em>"It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs."</em></p>



<p>Previously, Hamaguchi-san revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/"><strong>development team was considering switching to Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part 3, which made more than a few shudder at the thought of the stuttering issues that would likely have plagued the experience, especially on PC. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 4</strong> will be an even more dated engine by the time the game comes out, so the game's visuals may leave<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> something to be desired</strong> compared to open-world games set to release in the future such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong></a></em>, which will fully leverage the engine's unique features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lumen</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nanite</strong>. Still, this could result in an easier Nintendo Switch 2 port and less demanding system specifications on PC so there's some clear pros and cons to the choice. </p>



<p>Hopefully, the customized engine powering the game will address this graphical fidelity gap and deliver excellent visuals befitting the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>



<p>With <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></a></em> having released this month on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series X|S</strong> this month and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/"><strong><em>Rebirth</em> set to do the same later this year</strong></a>, the series has returned to the spotlight, and now even more gamers are anticipating the reveal of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whose name has finally been decided. </p>



<p>If the game is aiming to <strong>release in time with the original's 35th anniversary</strong> in 2027, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>it will likely not take too long</strong></a> to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of a series that, for better or worse, is set to influence the entire franchise in the future.</p>

			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong>, isn't the typical third-person cover shooter you might remember from peak Xbox 360/PS3-era games. It's an <strong>extraction shooter</strong>, which means it's as much about the looting as it is about the shooting, but above all, it's about surviving.</p>



<p>You can fill your backpack with as much high-tier loot as it can carry, but it'll be all for naught if you can't make it back to your home base in Speranza alive. After playing for over a dozen hours (and climbing), there are a few things I wish I knew before I started raiding the surface of Calabretta.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-start-raiding">ARC Raiders Tips and Tricks - What You Need to Know Before You Start Raiding</h2>



<h3 id="h-track-everything">Track Everything</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Look for the little Icon in the top-right, that tells you it's an item you need.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even when you're just starting out, going to the surface on your first quests, fighting new ARCs for the first time to try and get some high-tier loot, it can all feel a bit aimless if you're just filling your backpack with the first things you find. </p>



<p>You only have so many slots to take things home with you, and only one of those slots is your <strong>Safe Pocket</strong>, where you can place one kind of item to make sure it comes home with you. If you're just grabbing the first things you find as you search the various cabinets, boxes, broken-down ARCs, and any nook and cranny where loot can be found, you'll fill your precious slots faster than you'll realize.</p>



<p>That leaves you stuck in your inventory menu, managing items either by dropping them or swapping them out with an item you found you actually need, and now every breach and search you perform gets bogged down and wastes time, time you may have needed to make it to an elevator or hatch to make it back to Speranza safely. Not to mention the fact that you're leaving yourself vulnerable to other Raiders while stuck in menus. </p>



<p>Take a few minutes before you jump into your next raid, figure out what upgrades you want next, and track their resources. <strong>Only grab items that have a marker in the top-right corner of their box,</strong> indicating it's something you actually need for an upgrade you want. You'll have better, more efficient raids, and upgrade your gear far faster than if you grab everything you see.</p>



<h3 id="h-rely-on-yourself-before-traders">Rely on Yourself Before Traders</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The more self-reliant you are, the better.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you start ARC Raiders, you'll meet five traders: <strong>Celeste, Shani, Tian Wen, Lance,</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong>. They'll each give you quests to complete as you dig further into the game, but they'll also sell you supplies across different categories, like <strong>Security, Guns, Grenades and Gadgets</strong>, and <strong>Health Items</strong>.</p>



<p>If you're having trouble holding on to resources and have the cash, then feel free to buy what you need from them, but, realistically, you'll likely never really need to use their shops. Or at least, once you build a <strong>Refiner</strong> for your workshop, you should be able to break down what you find up top into crafting materials you need, and craft what you're looking for at your <strong>Workbench</strong>. The money you acquire from selling any loot is still useful to have for a rainy day, but it's a far better use of your cash to expand the limit of your <strong>Stash</strong> before spending it all on items that you can craft yourself, especially in your earlier hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-experience-will-be-as-chill-as-you-want-it-to-be">Your Experience Will be as Chill as You Want it to Be</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's a lot to be said about how multiplayer games with a PvP aspect should handle matchmaking. I won't get into the meat of it here, but for my money, the way Embark handles matchmaking, at least in my experience, is the way to do it. The team employs <strong>aggression-based matchmaking</strong>, which means you'll get matched up with more PvP-minded players the more you play with a PvP mindset.</p>



<p>But if you're not shooting at other players, if you're just greeting them with a friendly 'hello' and looting alongside them peacefully, then you'll keep getting matched with players of that ilk. ARCs are dangerous enough, and ARC Raiders is arguably a better experience when focusing on the common robot enemy, instead of your fellow Raider, who is just trying to survive.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not fool-proof, even when you go in Solo, which is usually where you'll get a better chance of finding other passive players. But if you want to try and make your looting experience a little safer, strong use of the <strong>"</strong><em><strong>Don't Shoot!"</strong></em> emote can go a long way.</p>



<h3 id="h-being-successfully-sneaky-is-more-audio-than-visual">Being Successfully Sneaky is More Audio Than Visual</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>All you need to do is duck into some bushes.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This isn't to say that you should walk into the sightlines of every ARC and potential enemy Raider you come across because you think you'll be far enough away that they won't see you. Maybe that'll be the case with an opposing player, but an ARC can still spot you from a certain degree of distance.</p>



<p>That said, the thing to focus on more than anything is how loud you're being when you're topside. <strong>You'll draw attention to yourself faster the louder you are</strong>, which is why you'll want to be as quiet as you can when up top. On the flip side, you also want to be quiet because it gives you more opportunity to listen closely for other Raiders.</p>



<p>As far as the actual sightlines for ARCs, though, often all you need to do is hide in some bushes to avoid their ire. It's not foolproof, and if you're hurt while trying to hide, your character won't be able to audibly hide the pain, and you'll draw attention to yourself, but it's often all you have to do. <strong>There's a serious lack of available cover Topisde</strong>, and you should try to keep an eye open for any hidey-holes to duck into if you suddenly find yourself in a fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-lose-track-of-time">Don't Lose Track of Time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore all you want, but don't lose track of time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you jump into a session, you're immediately met with a countdown at the top of your screen. It's telling you how much time is left before all the elevators on that map close, and you're left with having to find a Raider Hatch to make it back home.</p>



<p>Obvious as it may seem, <strong>you really cannot lose track of time</strong>. Particularly when you're in your early hours, if you start seeing you're getting to 10 minutes or less to get to an elevator, you should make getting to an elevator your only priority. If you're not paying attention to the map, then you're probably not aware of which elevators have already closed and which ones remain open. <strong>Your stamina only goes so far,</strong> so hoofing it across the map will take you more time than you think, and you can easily find yourself stuck Topside.</p>



<p>Plus, you don't always know what you're going to run into as you try to make the cross to an elevator, if you're not already near one. Losing track of time is the easiest mistake you can make while Topside, and you don't want to make getting home tougher than it already is.</p>
