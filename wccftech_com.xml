			<p>KOEI TECMO's Team Ninja is about to launch NINJA GAIDEN 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be available on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), but their work doesn't stop there, given that there is a DLC titled 'The Two Masters' due to be released early next year.</p>



<p>Game Director Masakazu Hirayama talked about this DLC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGrGeUYAeA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which was recorded at Tokyo Game Show 2025. </p>



<p><em>The Two Masters DLC, which will be available in early 2026, contains new weapons for Yakumo and Ryu. You can see from the key visual that Yakumo's new weapon captures his personality and his approach to combat with his expressive abilities. Whereas Ryu’s weapon has a more precise look to it and will allow you to perform powerful and high-speed abilities. Each of these weapons will have its own distinct qualities and a plethora of mechanics for NINJA GAIDEN 4 players to dig into. So, we invite players to look forward to it.<br>In addition to these weapons, there's also going to be new story content included in the Two Masters DLC, and the story content takes place after the events of the base game and unfolds from the perspective of both of these characters. In addition to the story content, there will also be post-game challenge content that exists separately from the Ninja Trials that are in the base game. So there is a lot of content for players to dig into.</em></p>



<p>The Two Masters DLC can be accessed by purchasing NINJA GAIDEN 4 Deluxe Edition or the Deluxe Edition Upgrade. The Deluxe Edition costs $20 more than the base edition.</p>



<p>The base game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last between 15 and 20 hours</a>, but the DLC will undoubtedly increase the time players can spend in the action game. Team Ninja did not quantify by how much, though.</p>
