			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI may break records in the gaming industry not only in terms of profits, but also in terms of price tags, as a known analyst believes the game will cost more than any other title on the market.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">The Telegraph</a>, Wedbush Securities' Michael Patcher, known for making some bold predictions in the past, said that he expects a high price, $100, for the new entry in the series by Rockstar Games at launch, which would make it the first video game to be sold at such a high price, not counting special or limited editions. Still, no matter the price point, Patcher expects the game to be immensely profitable, likely generating $10 billion in lifetime and $500 million annually from <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a>. Commenting on the game's budget, Patcher's estimates are more in line with what we have heard from other analysts, placing them in the $1.5 billion range, also including marketing costs.</p>



<p>Although predictions may vary, the consensus among analysts is that Grand Theft Auto VI is going to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time, if not the biggest.<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/"> Last month</a>, Konvoy's Managing Partner Josh Chapman confirmed the firm's prediction that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first two months of availability, with Take-Two recouping a potential $2 billion investment within a month from release. Even by other metrics, such as number of copies sold, player count, and viewership, the new entry in the series is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">record-shattering release. </a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026,</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, but going from past Rockstar Games titles' launches, we should expect the game to make its debut on the platform sometime in 2027.</p>

			<p>The preload for the first Battlefield 6 Open Beta weekend is available now on all platforms via the respective store pages ahead of the beginning of the test, which is set for Saturday, August 9 (although there is an Early Access beta that begins on Thursday, August 7). On Steam, the download size is 39.24 GB. In case you're wondering about the PC system requirements, they can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-requirements-relatively-mild/">here</a>, and they're not that scary if you have built a PC in the last four or five years or so. </p>



<p>The official Battlefield account on X also <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1952412102871994565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how the Open Beta test will differ from the Battlefield Labs testing and the final game. The Assault class has had some of its abilities reworked to be team-oriented; for example, Commanding Presence has replaced Enhanced Mobility as the new Signature Trait, speeding up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and taking the team out of combat status faster. Moreover, the Spawn Beacon has been transferred from the Recon class to the Assault class. Although the Deploy Beacon has traditionally been a Recon class staple, it has had its challenges there. By moving it to the Assault class for Battlefield 6, the developers hope to make it a teamplay tool for frontline flanking and coordinated squad movement. The Deploy Beacon can now only be used a finite number of times per squad, and it will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns on it. Finally, the Assault Ladder is a new gadget that provides squads access to previously unreachable areas. Depending on the deployment angle, it can function as a ladder or a ramp. As a powerful teamplay gadget, it allows Assault players to help their entire team overcome obstacles, gain height advantages, and surprise the enemy.</p>



<p>According to feedback, the Engineer works well right now and will not be receiving changes at this time. The Support, however, may get some minor tweaks to the refresh rate of supply crates and how well its signature weapon buffs contribute to the game's flow. The Recon has had one of its training options, Pathfinder, replaced by Spec Ops:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Spec Ops 0</strong>:<strong> </strong>Your base class training, available from the start and allows quieter takedowns, crouch and prone movement.</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 1</strong>: Spots nearby enemy gadgets (except when sprinting).</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 2</strong>:<strong> </strong>Going prone takes you out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, the Recon class now features an Active Ability at Level 3 that lets players call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting.</p>



<p>Lastly, as mentioned in the headline, the developers confirmed in a press briefing (as <a href="https://twitter.com/undefined/status/1952011658143924686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1952011658143924686%7Ctwgr%5E668771305845d75d42a62ab4f1f2512df684bf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-confirmed-to-have-skill-based-matchmaking-no-server-browser-3233524%2F">reported by CharlieIntel</a>) that matchmaking in Battlefield 6 will be based on a series of factors, including ping, player location, server availability, and some skill checks. It is unclear on which criteria this will be based, but the goal is clearly to deliver a more evenly balanced experience between players with relatively similar skills.</p>



<p>On PC, Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-ea-partners-battlefield-6-pc-xess-2-launch-optimizations-for-intel-core-ultra-cpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the official partner for the game</a>, although Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-feature-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-intel-xess-support-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support all upscalers</a>.
