			<p>The Xbox next-generation system is reportedly targeting a 2027 launch window, according to a new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from a new video shared by Moore's Law is Dead on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, whose track record regarding console rumors has been solid with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">on-point leaks for the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>. According to the YouTuber, multiple unspecified sources have revealed that Microsoft is talking openly about the 2027 release window with partners behind the scenes, with reports having become even more frequent since earlier leaks of the APU..</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-next-amd-magnus-apu-leaked-specifications">Xbox Next AMD Magnus APU Leaked Specifications</h2>



<p>Besides discussing the potential Xbox next-generation system release window, the new video by Moore's Law is Dead also discussed some of the specifications of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">AMD Magnus APU</a> that will power the system, which you can find summarized below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Xbox Next (Magnus APU) Rumored Specs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>APU ARCHITECTURE (Chiplet Design)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Total Die Size</td><td>408 mm² (Full Size)</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 1 (SOC)</td><td>144 mm² (CPU Core, Video Out, AI Engine)<br>Node: TSMC N3P (Node confirmed in alleged external documentation).</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 2 (GPU)</td><td>264 mm² (Shared with desktop Radeon products)<br>Node: TSMC N3C or N3P (Unconfirmed).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>GPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Compute Units (CUs)</td><td>68 RDNA5 CUs (Disabled from up to 70 CUs)</td></tr><tr><td>Shader Engines</td><td>4 Shader Engines (3 standard engines + 1 lopsided shared engine with either 8 or 16 CUs).

<p>Unlike for the PlayStation 6 Orion APU, Moore's Law is Dead doesn't know the final clock targets for the CPU and GPU of the Xbox next-generation system, so it's impossible to make a solid performance comparison between the two systems. </p>



<p>Even in the most extreme scenario of a 350W TDP, GPU clocking above 3GHz, and some CPU cores above 6GHz, the Xbox Next is expected to be no more than a third faster than the PlayStation 6. Considering Microsoft did lower the expected clock speeds of the Xbox Series X, the same could happen for the Xbox next-generation system, especially if the company is going for the expected power target of a console.</p>



<p>As such, on average, the Xbox next-generation system should be expected to offer the premium version of the performance the PlayStation 6 will offer, according to Moore's Law is Dead. If a game delivers 4K@120 FPS with ray tracing on the PS6, it will likely deliver 4K@144 FPS on the Xbox next-generation system. This is a small difference that will probably go unnoticed by anyone who isn't a PC-focused gamer playing on a high-refresh monitor looking for the very best.</p>

<p>As Moore's Law is Dead, the track record is not perfect, we have to take everything with a grain of salt until Microsoft announces the Xbox next generation system <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-were-designing-a-full-roadmap-of-gaming-chips-for-xbox/">in much better detail than they have in the past</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">With both systems reportedly targeting a 2027 release window</a>, the next console generation is fast approaching.</p>

			<p>Renowned AMD leaker Kepler has <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/post-270885018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed on the NeoGAF board</a> that Sony is planning to launch the PlayStation 6 console in 2027, with the caveat that 'unexpected delays' could still happen.</p>



<p>This would be right on time for a 7-year lifecycle, just like its predecessor, the PlayStation 4. The main difference would be with regards to the PlayStation 5 Pro, which was released four years after the PS5 (and therefore only three years before the alleged PS6 launch window), whereas the PlayStation 4 Pro appeared on the market three years after the PS4 and four years before the launch of the PS5.</p>



<p>Rumors about the specifications of the PlayStation 6 have been circulating for a while, mainly due to YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an estimated computing power of 34 to 40 Teraflops with a massive ray tracing performance uplift of 6x to 12x compared to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, AMD and Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have divulged new details on their ongoing Project Amethyst collaboration</a> to improve hardware and software in future GPUs and consoles. Three technologies were singled out at this time: Radiance Cores, Neural Arrays, and Universal Compression. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first one is specifically designed to deliver that rumored ray tracing performance boost: the Radiance Cores hardware blocks will accelerate the computationally intensive ray tracing traversal calculations, freeing shader cores to work on the rest of the rendered scene. </li>



<li>Neural Arrays, on the other hand, are dedicated AI accelerator units integrated into the GPU architecture. They are designed to handle machine learning inference tasks natively on the console hardware, achieving much greater efficiency compared to current methods.</li>



<li>Finally, Universal Compression is a new device-agnostic compression technology that reduces the data footprint across textures, geometry, and other game assets without significantly reducing quality. It optimizes memory bandwidth and storage, allowing games to load faster and operate more efficiently. This should also translate into improved streaming performance, possibly reducing stuttering during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, in that video, PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased that these technologies would appear on a new console (the PlayStation 6) in a few years' time</a>. If the rumor is true, that just means two years, possibly a bit sooner than most expected. Indeed, it feels like we only started getting 'next-generation' games in the past couple of years, whereas most titles previously supported cross-generation releases. Still, this generation has a few aces left, like The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
