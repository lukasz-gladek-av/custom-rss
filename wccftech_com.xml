			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes to find across all 14 chapters. Each note adds a good deal of context to the story and the past trauma's Hazel is uncovering, so it's worth your time to seek them all out.</p>
<p>This guide will tell you where to find all the notes in Chapter 12.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 12</h2>
<p>There are more notes in Chapter 12 than in any other individual level in South of Midnight, with 19 total notes to find. At least it makes Chapter 13 a much easier ordeal, with only two notes left to check off after grabbing all of the notes in Chapter 12. There are no notes in the final chapter of the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Should I Leave? -&nbsp;</strong>Right at the beginning of the chapter, follow the main path directly in front of you and you'll come to a sign post pointing in multiple directions, with a tree stump to its right. This first note is resting on the stump.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Should I Stay? -&nbsp;</strong>After following the sign towards the Town on the Tapestry twice, a carriage with a ghostly warthog will appear. This note will be on the same stump where you found the first note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Record Keeps Skipping</strong> - When you walk inside the carriage, you'll see it's bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. This note can be found next to the gramophone at the end of the hall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Milk and Sugar, Love? -&nbsp;</strong>This note is a few steps ahead of the previous note, below a giant portrait of a family on a silver tray with a tea set.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Ring, Ring</strong> - As you follow the guiding strands deeper into Roux's carriage, you'll find this note attached to the handlebars of a tricycle, just a few steps from the previous note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Roux's Limerance</strong> - Continue following the guiding strands. You'll find this note on the second floor of Roux's carriage, on a table right at the top of the stairs next to a stuffed turtle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Hungry Maw</strong> - From the previous note, you'll find this one stuck to a red refrigerator on the right side of the room.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Still Stars Don't Remember -&nbsp;</strong>You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the level, on the right side of the arena next to a box you can move to reach a Floof knot in the area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Joe Goodfellow, 74 -&nbsp;</strong>Before jumping into the wind tunnel, you can see from finding the previous note, you'll find this note stuck to a door, to the right of the window where you can look in and see the echo of an old man down on one knee.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Many Little Things</strong> - After using the wind tunnel and wall-running to reach the next platform, turn to your left to find this note lying on a lawn chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollowed Love -&nbsp;</strong>Just ahead of where you found the previous note, you'll find this one on a table on the left side of the balcony.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Spit It Out</strong> - Keeping following the guiding strands and use the next wind tunnel on the path. When you land, turn right and you should be able to see a health filament in the distance. Turn right again to go around the building on the right side of the street, and you'll find this note on a table around the corner.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Ella Mae, 7 -&nbsp;</strong>Follow the guiding strands until you reach a neon sign for Gouldeau’s Jazz, and instead of continuing straight ahead, jump to the platform lower down to your right. Head straight ahead up the stairs, and you'll find this note stuck to the second door on your right, next to another window where you can look in and see an echo of a little girl praying in her bed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>I miss, I miss, I miss -&nbsp;</strong>While standing in front of the door with the previous note, turn around and look down to see the echo of a platform you can conjure. Jump to that platform, then use the grapple to get back to solid ground and you'll find this note on a table behind a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Would Be Beautiful -&nbsp;</strong>After the second combat encounter of the level, follow the path until Hazel calls out to another ghostly spirit, only to be ignored. Stopping where she calls out, turn around and you'll see a sign for the 'Mesmerizing Roux' that you can pull on. Pull it and jump to the platform it reveals, then head left to find this note and a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Tempest Hamlin, 42 -&nbsp;</strong>Continue to follow the path from the little detour you took to find the previous note, and you'll find this note stuck to a door on the left side of the path, next to another sign advertising Roux's show and a window you can look into with the echo of a woman repeatedly taking a bow.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Passage -&nbsp;</strong>On the second level of the clock tower, after using the first giant gear to slowly bring you up to the next platform, you'll find this note across the gap and on a table next to a box of gears you can pick up and throw.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>I'm Trying -&nbsp;</strong>As you continue to climb the clock tower, at one point you'll use your grapple to land in front of an elevator shaft. Keep following the main path from here by jumping through the hole of the giant gear, and you'll come across this note on a stool on your path with a gear resting against the wall and a light above it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You Gotta Release It -&nbsp;</strong>After the combat encounter at the top of the clock tower, head outside and before jumping into the wind tunnel, turn left and you'll find this note resting on a box, with a Floof knot steps away from it at the back of the balcony.</p>
<p>That's where all 19 notes are found in South of Midnight's Chapter 12. If you've followed along with these guides so far, you'll have found 101 out of 103 notes. Only two more to go, and they're both in Chapter 13.</p>

			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive has unveiled a lot more details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a>: Battle for Brooklyn DLC, starting with its release date. The expansion will be released on May 27 on PC and consoles and will be priced at $14.99. It also comes with purchases of The Division 2 Gold Edition or The Division 2 Ultimate Edition. Both editions include the standard game, the Warlords of New York expansion, 50 stash slots, and a level 40 boost, allowing players to jump into the Battle for Brooklyn campaign right from the start. The Ultimate Edition also includes 1000 bonus Premium Credits and the Year 1 Pass, unlocking endgame specializations, exclusive missions, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn DLC &amp; Year 7 Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLSVDB3V7jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn brings players back to the location of the first game. According to the developers, though, this version of Brooklyn offers new opportunities for exploration and interaction. The DLC's main missions have been crafted to provide a bespoke narrative experience, allowing players to immerse themselves deeper in the story rather than feel overwhelmed by side missions. Ubisoft Massive estimates that the first playthrough could take anywhere between six and ten hours to complete. The Cleaners now wield a new “Purple Flame” weapon. Players will have to beware, as it inflicts a corrosive effect that reduces the player character's max armor.</p>
<p>Smart Cover returns in Battle for Brooklyn as a redesigned skill for PvE and PvP. The use of Smart Cover will increase the offensive and defensive cover buffs and increase boss resistance for all allies. Players can choose between two variants, the Precision Smart Cover and the Fortified Smart Cover. Both variants have some stats that are tuned differently for PvP.</p>
<p>The developers also looked beyond The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn, specifically to what players can expect in Year 7. For the next year of live support, Ubisoft Massive will focus on three aspects: improving the onboarding process, adding more depth to the endgame, and making sure the seasons are a 'cornerstone' of the game's experience with more regular updates. Interestingly, they also said that the open world will be more dynamic thanks to a new wrapper that reacts to the player's actions while unlocking exotic blueprints.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstations-classic-console-themes-from-30th-anniversary-celebrations-are-back-in-new-ps5-system-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>
