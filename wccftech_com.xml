			<p>The future of the Metal Gear Solid series is uncertain at this time, but it may include new entries in the series as well as other remakes, according to producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Japanese publication Real Sound</a>, Okamura-san was asked about what could be next for the series, which was brought back this year with the release of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The series producer wants to continue working on the series, but how the franchise's future will be shaped is still uncertain, and may involve both remakes and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new works".</em></p>



<p>The Metal Gear series is akin to the history of video games, spanning from pixel art games to cinematic experiences, so the remake approach for each title would be different, Okamura-san explained. As such, the remake method used to remake Snake Eater wouldn't work for every remake, which would need to be considered separately. This suggests that Konami may not pursue a 3D remake of the original 8-bit Metal Gear games, as the producer indicated the Delta method isn't universally applicable.</p>



<p>Still, with almost every main entry in the series to date being playable on current gaming systems<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/"> thanks to either backward compatibility or remasters</a>, there's not a pressing need to remake any of them, except the fourth entry in the series, Guns of the Patriots, which is still only available on PlayStation 3. Speaking about this game, Okamura-san noted that the notorious difficulty of developing for the PS3 resulted in the creation of special, highly complex code that would pose unique challenges for a modernization effort.</p>



<p>No matter if with a remake or remaster, a modern version of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots would be rather welcome. Following the release of the Master Collection Vol 1, there have been indications that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">the fourth entry in the series would be included in the hypothetical Master Collection Vol 2</a>, so the time when players will be able to experience the end of Solid Snake's story on modern hardware may not be too far in the future. Hopefully, Okamura-san and his team will face these development challenges head-on to provide fans of the series quick access to a game that has been too long stuck on original hardware.</p>
