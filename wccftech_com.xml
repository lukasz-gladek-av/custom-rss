			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/pax-dei-arc-raiders-open-beta-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">added to a new batch of games</a> at launch this month and as updates to games already available, with players sporting GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs getting the most out of DLSS 4 and all of NVIDIA's graphics technology. NVIDIA has also <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-geforce-game-ready-driver/">released new drivers</a> for ARC Raiders ahead of its server slam test before it launches later this month.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/">Battlefield 6 and Little Nightmares III</a> were the two highlights launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, and this week, the attention turns to Pax Dei, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/">new MMO arriving on PC </a>and as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-keeper-pax-dei-xbox-game-pass-october-2025/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this week on October 16, and Keeper, the latest game from Double Fine Productions, which is due to launch later this week on October 17 (and also directly into Xbox Game Pass) will launch with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>Fairlight84, the free-to-play PvP first-person shooter, where everyone has been turned into a new zombie-cyborg hybrid called 'Zomborgs,' also arrives this week on October 16, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Regarding the ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">server slam test going on this weekend</a>, you'll also be able to jump into that with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation turned on. Of course, you'll want to ensure you have the latest drivers installed, but once you do, you'll be good to go for this test and for the game's coming launch on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Also happening this week, NBA2K26 gets support for DLSS Super Resolution, and if you are eligible for GeForce Rewards, then you'll be able to grab a free golden key for Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>A couple of notable titles are also launching later this month with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support, including Obsidian's second major RPG for the year, The Outer Worlds 2, and the long-awaited Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which launch on October 29, 2025 and October 21, 2025, respectively.</p>

			<p>Battlefield Studios, the collective name for the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a few balancing tweaks were rolled out to the game without the need for players to download a patch.</p>



<p>You can find the changes below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the M2010 ESR from 900 to 800 m/s</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the PSR from 750 to 720 m/s</li>



<li>Shotgun projectiles will now take drag into account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of the balancing effort. While the game launched in a solid state, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">concurrency records on Steam</a> and very positive reviews from critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ours</a>), the community has already requested other changes and the developers will have to continue monitoring the live service situation.</p>



<p>In other news, Reddit users have started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">reporting</a> that the developers' <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/">partnership with Sony and Microsoft against the usage of Cronus Zen devices</a> for cheats is paying off. The first permabans have already been dealt, and indeed, the people behind the Cronus Zen have reportedly recommended avoiding using the device for now:</p>



<p><em>We're currently advising all Battlefield 6 players, especially those on PC using the Zen with any of our latest scripts, to pause usage for now. The team is actively testing to understand what's causing it and ensure everything remains safe and stable. Please avoid using the Zen in Battlefield 6 until we confirm it's fine to resume. We also ask that no one publicly shares or discusses any bans â€” this draws unnecessary attention to the community and makes testing more difficult. </em></p>
