			<p>Players subscribed to the lowest, or 'Essential' tier of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/">PlayStation Plus</a> can already grab the three free games for April 2025. Beginning on April 15, 2025, players subscribed to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers can collect their additional free games for the month.</p>
<p>As announced in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>, six games are being added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers, and two classic titles, one from the original PlayStation and the other from the PS2, are being added to the PS Plus Premium classic games catalog.</p>
<p>The six games added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers and above include the 2023 commercial hit Hogwarts Legacy, a brand new puzzle game called Blue Prince, which is launching onto the service tomorrow, April 10. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, EA Sports PGA Tour, Battlefield 1, and Plate Up!.</p>
<p>The two classic titles are Alone in the Dark 2 from the original PlayStation and War of the Monsters from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Of all eight games in this lineup, Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most high-profile title, but arguably, the most prominent inclusion is the soon-to-release Blue Prince. Reviews for the new puzzle game from developer Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury went live earlier this week, and so far, it has the highest score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">Metacritic</a> for any game released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's being touted as a new masterpiece, so if you like puzzle games and have a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription, it might be worth checking out. Xbox players aren't being left out either since it'll also be available in Xbox Game Pass when it launches tomorrow.</p>
