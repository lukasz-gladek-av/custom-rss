			<p>In some new documents and internal emails provided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> from a large US retailer, they are anticipating that they will sell out of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day that pre-orders are open due to limited unit allocation from Nintendo. Thus far, information about the Nintendo Switch 2 has been limited, with a Nintendo Direct taking place yesterday to unveil some new games that are coming to its predecessor. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is due to get its very own direct on April 2, which will give people the highly anticipated look at the new console that they've been waiting for.</p>
<p>According to the documents sent to Insider Gaming, the Nintendo Switch 2 is allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">scheduled to release in June</a>, which has been widely rumored across a span of communities and was spoken about by developers at GDC.</p>
<p>For some there may be a touch of confusion about when pre-orders go live, as there was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Buy Canada leak earlier</a> on in the week that said that pre-orders would be going live on April 2, the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. That post has since been removed by Best Buy Canada, but the retailer hasn't issued a response as of yet.</p>
<p>At this moment in time, it's uncertain whether or not the Best Buy Canada "leak" was a mistake or not as the company hasn't commented on the situation. However, as soon as it began to circulate online and feed into rumors, it was promptly removed.</p>
<p>In the documents sent to Insider Gaming, it's reported that pre-orders will actually be going live on April 9, which is one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents also contained information about a marketing strategy to include a Countdown Clock, with Nintendo allegedly confirming the time on April 2. It also says that there will be an exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>
<p>However, as we have not personally seen these documents, it's uncertain whether this is factual or not, and all of this information is subject to change at any point, with major details being set to release during the Direct.</p>
<p>While we still don't know the date of pre-orders, there is a high chance that it will be shortly after the Direct, most likely within a week of the Direct taking place.</p>

			<p>For those who are fans of the life simulation genre that is predominantly conquered by The Sims, there is a new competitor on the block that is released in Early Access today. inZOI is now available in Early Access and has already reached the top spot on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Steam Top Sellers</a> just 40 minutes after it was released. If you want to see what it's all about, make sure to check out the Early Access launch video for inZOI below.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, inZOI was ranked first on Steam's Global Top Wishlists while people were actively waiting for the game to release in Early Access today. There has been a large buzz surrounding the game, as content creators globally have created various videos and written content about the title, showcasing what they can expect from this game. Currently, inZOI is available on Steam for $39.99, with all updates and DLC provided for free until the game's full release.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the Early Access launch, then inZOI demo was also available to players across the globe, which gave them the opportunity to try out inZOI's Character Studio and Build Studio. However, now that the game is officially in Early Access, the demo has been closed down and is no longer available.</p>
<p>inZOI was also incredibly popular on Twitch, where it reached the fifth spot in the Games category on Twitch as of March 27, and is likely to see it spike again with the full release and many able to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>Thus far, inZOI has been well received, with a Very Positive rating on Steam and over 3600 reviews at the time of writing.</p>
<p>"I created and nurtured inZOI with great care as if it were my child, though it still has a lot of room for improvement. As inZOI takes its first steps into the world, I feel both proud and somewhat anxious - hoping it won't stumble or get hurt," says inZOI Studio CEO, Producer, and Director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim. "It would be deeply appreciated if you could watch over the game with warmth and support. As we prepare for inZOI's official launch, we will continue to genuinely engage with creators across the globe to make it better, one step at a time."</p>
<p>inZOI has over 250 customization options and 400 mental elements, with a wide creative suite that is powered by on-device generative AI. The title has been produced utilizing Unreal Engine 5, and requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">relatively beefy specifications</a> to be able to run it.</p>
