			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>
