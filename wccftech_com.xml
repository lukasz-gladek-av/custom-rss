			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition brings <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-ray-tracing-improvements-comparison/">significant visual improvements</a> to the fifth entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games, but a new mod that was released online a few days back introduces even more stunning improvements that bring the game's realism to new heights.</p>
<p>The ChromatiX Enhanced mod v0.1 public beta, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChromatiXGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, introduces some very welcome visual improvements to the recently released Enhanced Edition, such as increased traffic and pedestrian density, improved lighting and atmosphere for all weather conditions during day and night, increased reflection intensity, brighter nights, enhanced night sky and more. Even in this early version of the mod, the end results are stunning, as showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@INTERGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTER.</a></p>

<p>While many are having issues with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, specifically regarding GTA Online account migration, there's no denying that the improvements Rockstar Games has introduced to the game are an excellent reason to revisit the game and possibly bring new players in. The introduction of ray tracing, DLSS, and FSR support, among other things, also bode well for the inevitable PC port of Grand Theft Auto VI, which will launch sometime after the game debuts on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy version</a> is also still available for purchase to allow those who don't meet the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">system requirements</a> to continue playing the game.</p>
