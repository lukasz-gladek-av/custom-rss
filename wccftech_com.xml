			<p>According to two separate and trustworthy sources, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is reportedly considering the merging of the <strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> console subscription tier with <strong>PC Game Pass</strong>. The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> that the plans are far from finalized, but that's what Microsoft is thinking right now, and Windows Central has subsequently <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-plans-to-expand-xbox-game-pass-and-merge-pc-game-pass-with-another-tier-more-third-party-service-bundles-may-be-on-the-way-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up the reporting</a> with its own sources.</p>



<p>Here's a breakdown of the respective feature sets as they are currently available to users:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Feature</th><th data-align="left">PC Game Pass</th><th data-align="left">Xbox Game Pass Premium</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Price</strong></td><td data-align="left">$11.99/month</td><td data-align="left">$14.99/month</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Platforms</strong></td><td data-align="left">PC only</td><td data-align="left">Console, PC, Cloud</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>First-Party Day-One Access</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No (added within 1 year)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>EA Play Included</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Cloud Gaming</strong></td><td data-align="left">No</td><td data-align="left">Yes (unlimited)​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></td><td data-align="left">N/A (PC only)</td><td data-align="left">Yes (on console)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Game Library Size</strong></td><td data-align="left">Full PC catalog</td><td data-align="left">~200 games</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Merging Xbox Game Pass Premium with PC Game Pass likely means the new tier would include <strong>cloud gaming, EA Play, and first-party day-one access</strong>, arguably the three primary features of Game Pass. Of course, <strong>it's most likely going to cost slightly more</strong> if this plan goes through. It's hard to take a guess, but perhaps somewhere around $17-18.</p>



<p>At that point, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>could really need more bundled third-party services to boost its value</strong>. Indeed, that's the other half of Warren's rumor, though he does not share any specifics on which ones. <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong> and <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> are already included <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since October's big restructuring</a>, so it would have to be something else. Do you reckon Microsoft should go forward with this merger plan, or would you rather things stay as they are? Let us know in the comments below.</p>



<p>In related Xbox news, it seems like the next-generation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2027</a></strong>, but Microsoft hasn't fully committed to that yet. Most sources agree <strong>it's going to be a console/PC hybrid</strong> that runs PC apps and will even have different SKUs from other OEMs like ASUS.</p>
