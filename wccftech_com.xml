			<p>The PC version of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a> in the United States, suggesting that its launch is near. An official announcement may well come at The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley's show which features both awards for the best games of 2025 but also plenty of announcements for upcoming and existing titles. The Game Awards 2025 airs on Thursday, December 11.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the ESRB rating also reveals that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on PC, just as it was for the PS5 version. It's a change from the first game, which was published on PC by 505 Games. This is also surprising because Kojima Productions bought the publishing rights back from Sony and could have technically self-published this sequel. However, it may be that the studio doesn't yet have the necessary expertise or resources to self-publish, and as such, they are still relying on their partner, Sony. It'll be interesting to see whether the game ever makes it on Xbox like the previous installment and if so, if SIE will still publish there.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating is M for Mature (17+) with Blood and Gore, Partial Nudity, Strong Language, and Violence highlighted by the board. It's the same rating as the PlayStation 5 version, although that's not a surprise, as the content is likely to be identical.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26, 2025, for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling an estimated 1.4 million units in June</a> and earning more widespread acclaim than its predecessor. In the Wccftech review, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online.</em></p>

			<p>Destiny 2 is a week away from launching its Star Wars expansion, Renegades, which frankly looks more Star Wars-y than when Destiny did its first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV4qakZgCHY">Star Wars collab in February</a>. Ahead of that launch, it hosted a live stream today where it delved into everything arriving in next week's expansion and showed off a new launch trailer.</p>



<p>Renegades introduces a slew of new weapons, including the Praxic Blade, which is Destiny's version of a lightsaber. Blasters are also an entirely new weapon archetype introduced in Renegades, and feature a heat-based firing system that can overheat instead of having to reload magazines.</p>



<p>The expansion will also introduce the Lawless Frontier, a new activity for players that's meant to be replayable and lets players rise through different Syndicate factions through the new Notoriety system.</p>

<p>The three factions are the Pikers, Tharsis Reformation, and Totality Division. Each has missions you can undertake for them, either by yourself or in groups of three. Different missions include bounty hunts, smuggling runs, sabotage excursions, and a new Invasion mode, which is a feature you opt into that allows a Guardian to spawn into the playing field to try and disrupt your progress.</p>



<p>Bungie also showed off the new dungeon, Equilibrium, which will arrive shortly after Renegades on December 13, 2025. There's also a new video documentary with the team going behind-the-scenes on the making of Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>

<p>Overall, it looks like it'll be an engaging expansion for Destiny 2 players to dig into, but that's not the question really, for Renegades. The question is whether it can bring the players Destiny 2 has lost back to the game.</p>



<p>Just last month, the game reached an <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">all-time low concurrent player count on Steam</a>, and it's not as if those players have returned. The last time it hit over 100K players on Steam was in July, and since early September, it's stayed significantly below 50K.</p>



<p>Of course, Steam concurrent numbers aren't everything and only show a portion of the whole picture. But it's not exactly a good sign for the game, and with<a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/"> everything else that Bungie is dealing with</a>, a poor launch for Renegades could mean even darker times ahead for the beloved studio. </p>
