			<p>While EA is all-in on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> right now after it had a massive launch at the beginning of October and earlier this week launched its battle royale mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, Respawn is still chugging away at Apex Legends, with its 27th season set to arrive next week, titled 'Amped.'</p>



<p>The new season arrives with a refresh to one of the game's more popular maps, Olympus, and buffs for a few Legends, specifically Valkyrie, Rampart, and Horizon. This season also adds new mechanics that'll make the game even faster than it already is, with a new mantle boost giving players a speed boost on wall-bounces and mantling over ledges.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shows off the new mantle mechanics while featuring the aforementioned legends, and of course, the new refresh for Olympus, titled Olympus: Rising, is also heavily showcased.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding buffs for Valkyrie, her VTOL jets are getting a speed boost, while her missile swarm no longer does any self-damage, nor does it have height restrictions. It also scans enemies hit with the swarrm and places a cooldown on movement passive abilities. Her Skyward Dive also has a shorter takeoff time.</p>



<p>For Rampart, her Amped Cover walls gain health with Evo increases and even include a roof. For Horizon, her Gravity Lift cooldown time has been reduced, while her Black Hole ability now gains even more health.</p>



<p>For all legends, the mantle boost gives players a speed boost for wall and ledge bounces, and the Trident now has improved collision and its own dedicated health bar.</p>



<p>In all the hullabaloo of Battlefield 6, it's easy to lose Apex Legends in the mix. That said, it's consistently stayed above <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y">150K concurrent players on Steam this year</a>, only dipping below that figure a handful of times. There's no denying that it's still popular, and its longevity is not to be dismissed, as few live service games make it to their 27th season. </p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't feature any of the additional content found in the War of the Lions release and the mobile versions of the game, but this could quickly become a thing of the past, as a new mod now available online restores a small portion of this additional content.</p>



<p>The WotL Character Repair mod, developed by Dana Crysalis and now available for download for free from Nexus Mods, fixes Balthier and Luso, making it possible to add them to the party via Cheat Engine tables and use them in battle with their unique Jobs and ability sets. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to add the two characters to the game without using Cheat Engine due to how difficult it currently is to add new events to the game. Installation requires using the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2">Reloaded-II loader</a>, which can be less intuitive than just dropping some files into an installation folder.  Still, these are only minor inconveniences, considering the value of the mod.</p>

<p>Curious to see how well this new Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles mod works, I briefly tested it and can confirm that it indeed works as intended. I was able to add both Balthier and Luso to a battle party and use them as if they were a regular vanilla unit, which is not possible to do without this Repair mod, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-war-of-the-lions-content/">as my previous attempts testify</a>. Hopefully, more fixes will come for the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs to make them usable and further expand the game's content.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not the definitive version of the popular tactical role-playing game, lacking the aforementioned War of the Lions content, this new release is more than worth playing thanks to the many improvements it brings. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">You can learn more about them by checking out my review.</a></p>
