			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>
