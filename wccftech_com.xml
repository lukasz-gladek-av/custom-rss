			<p>Three PC games are integrating NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation shortly. Chronologically, the first one will be Jagex's RuneScape: Dragonwilds, the cooperative open world survival crafting game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in early access nearly three months ago</a>. </p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds debuted to decent numbers, registering a 52K concurrent player peak on Steam. However, those numbers are long gone - over the last week, the game has stayed below three thousand concurrent players at all times, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1374490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. Anyway, RuneScape: Dragonwilds launched with support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and DLAA, but a patch due today will also add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, boosting frame rates across the board for all owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 11, Brickadia LLC will launch the namesake next-generation brick building sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, where it is planned to stay until the end of 2026. In Brickadia, users have every creative tool, such as building, scripting, and more, available right in the game with real-time multiplayer enabled. That means they can work with friends to build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes without ever leaving the action. Some of the examples of things you can craft in Brickadia include skyscrapers, all sorts of vehicles, detailed islands, spaceships, and cityscapes.</p>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and supports hardware accelerated ray tracing, boosting UE5's own Lumen, as you can see below. To compensate for that performance cost, players will find NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA options available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, the Unreal Engine 5 sandbox indie MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-online-2-gets-epic-megagrant-will-migrate-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Online 2</a> will receive NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support later this month with its first expansion, Reckoning, <a href="https://www.mortalonline2.com/patch-notes-reckoning-ptr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available for testing in the Public Test Realm</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the course of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, you will connect with all sorts of people as you attempt to bring the whole of Australia into the Chiral Network. While the vast majority of preppers are encountered as part of the story, a few are entirely optional, and can be missed if you don't listen to what characters tell Sam and if you don't explore the map fully.</p>



<p>One of these optional preppers is <strong>The Inventor</strong>, a rather peculiar guy who has decided to bring Australia's current isolation to the next level by living on an island off the coast of the continent. Looking at the island from afar, it seems impossible to reach The Inventor's shelter, as no roads or bridges are going through or over the sea of tar, but there are actually a few easy ways to reach the island, and you can even reach him as soon as you get to Australia from the Plate Gate if you so desire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After reaching the beach closest to The Inventor's shelter, use your Odradek scanner to highlight areas where the tar is shallow. These areas, highlighted by yellow dots, can be traversed safely. Before you head out, however, <strong>look around the beach to find lost cargo for The Inventor</strong>, as he won't talk to you unlesss you have a delivery for him. Once you have loaded the cargo, you can follow the safe path, reach the shelter, and connect it to the Chiral Network.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if you are not a completionist who wants to see everything Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has to offer, there are still plenty of good reasons to unlock The Inventor as increasing the connection level with the prepper will unlock some <strong>useful items</strong>, including the Otter Head at level 1, the Stun Bomb at level 2, the Remote Stun Bomb at level 3, the Bola Stun Gun at level 4 and a Custom Hologram and a patch at level 5 with which you can customize your structures and backpack, respectively.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 docked VRR support may be technically feasible, but there would be too many hurdles to make it a smooth plug-and-play feature.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a supporter's question asking if the dock's authentication chip is the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't support VRR in docked mode, ruling out the possibility, as the authentication process is a separate process that takes place before any sort of output process begins. The reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 dock doesn't support VRR, Digital Foundry highlighted, has probably nothing to do with the dock, but rather with the Display Port to HDMI conversion through USB-C, which makes it difficult for VRR to work on the Steam Deck. Ultimately, Digital Foundry believes that VRR may be technically feasible, as it was recently proven how&nbsp;the dock can support it,&nbsp;but the hurdles to overcome may be too many to actually make it a smooth plug-and-play experience, which is what console users expect to find.</p>



<p>On a related note, the tech experts at Digital Foundry also commented on why so few Nintendo Switch 2 launch games do not support 40 FPS modes despite the 120 Hz panel making it a feasible option, saying that, at this time, not too many titles would benefit from it. At the same time, however, some games already supporting 40 FPS mode like Cyberpunk 2077, suggests that more titles will support it in the future, although it remains to be seen how many, especially if the VRR situation doesn't improve, as games would need to be locked at 40 FPS without VRR for a good experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the industry's most respected creators has joined the chorus of praise for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the JRPG developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive. Neil Druckmann, president and creative director at Naughty Dog and creator of The Last of Us franchise, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLvd-3qh08Q/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Rolled credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I’m in awe. One of the most moving, creative stories I've played in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Druckmann, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> he would leave his role as co-showrunner and director of the HBO adaptation of The Last of Us to focus solely on game development, certainly isn't the only one to rate the game so highly. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the highest rated new releases of 2025 so far, not to mention one of the most successful, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3.3 </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">units sold in 33 days</a> despite also being available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his 9.5/10 review of the game on Wccftech</a>, Francesco De Meo similarly lauded the game's narrative:</p>



<p><em>Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</em></p>



<p><em>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in RPGs in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Have you played the game yet, and if so, do you agree with all these compliments?</p>
