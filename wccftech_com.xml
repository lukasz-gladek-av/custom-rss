			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility feature is looking more interesting than expected before launch, as it manages to fix the massive performance issues of Batman Arkham Knight, one of the worst ports released for its predecessor.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-back-compat-fixes-batman-arkham-knight-switch-1s-worst-triple-a-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the new-generation system from Nintendo, which has launched worldwide today, runs the horrible port of the third main entry in the series developed by Rocksteady without the massive performance issues it has on the original system. As such, the translation layer that is being used on the new system to run the original code has proven to be effective, allowing the game to put the better specs of the Switch 2 to good use. Ultimately, there's no fixing for the compromises the port's developer had to make in terms of texture quality and lack of antialiasing, and there are still some stability issues, but the fact that the Switch 2 can brute force better performance in backward-compatible titles is quite promising.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid game, Batman Arkham Knight has been somewhat infamous since its release due to the horrible state it launched in on PC, which required multiple patches to fix. The late Nintendo Switch port of the game, which launched last year, is equally infamous for being absolutely terrible, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">running at a whopping 0 FPS in certain scenarios.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally launched worldwide, but not everyone is having a good release day. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-here-and-for-some-players-their-consoles-are-already-damaged-thanks-to-stores-stapling-holes-into-the-switch-2-screen/">earlier today</a>, some early adopters found their unit's screen damaged because store employees stapled their receipts in front of the console's box.</p>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch day, a day that's supposed to be exciting for players and developers alike, with a new Nintendo console in the market and hopefully, plenty of new experiences on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some players though, are definitely getting the kind of 'new experience' with their Switch 2 they didn't ask for, and that's the experience of their brand-new console already being broken, before they even opened the box.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">IGN</a>, some players who went to retail GameStop locations to pick up their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles through midnight launches got home to discover that there were <a href="https://x.com/Rudeboy__NYC/status/1930568461014499667">holes in the console's screen</a>, from <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">store employees stapling their receipts to the front of the Nintendo Switch 2 box</a>.</p>
<p>This happened to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">number of players</a> who went to the same GameStop in Staten Island, where it seems everyone who was at that location walked away with their receipt stapled to the front of the Switch 2 box.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu">
<p lang="en">Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed">Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed">2025-06-05T07:18:39.993Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone who went to that same GameStop, they will probably have to wait until that store gets its next shipment of Switch 2 consoles, to get their replacements. Though, the reaction online hasn't been all negative towards GameStop alone. Many players on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davefpg.bsky.social/post/3lqua356xqk23">social media</a> have also noted that Nintendo should've packaged the console better, and not have the screen facing up at the top of the box.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo repackages the Switch 2 in response to these issues, or if any more reports of retail employees puncturing holes in the screen crop up. Plenty of stores across the globe had midnight launches, including the newly-separated, Canadian-owned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/">EB Games</a>, and more reports of this happening at other stores have yet to be spotted. For now, it looks like this lone Staten Island store is the 'what not to do' example for everyone else.</p>

			<p>Funcom's survival multiplayer sandbox game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a> launches today for those who have purchased the Deluxe and Ultimate editions and it features NVIDIA DLSS 4 support for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The game includes support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available on all RTX GPUs), Frame Generation (available on RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs), and Multi Frame Generation (available on RTX 50 Series GPUs). According to NVIDIA, performance in Dune Awakening can be enhanced by an average of 4.9X at 4K resolution and max settings while activating all the above with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode. The official benchmarks show the RTX 5090 surpassing 338 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 averages 270 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti 239 FPS, and the RTX 5070 198 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Optionally, users can turn on the NVIDIA app override to improve DLSS quality in the game with the new transformer model. Lastly, Dune Awakening also supports NVIDIA Reflex, which NVIDIA says can reduce system latency by up to 50% in this title. As a reminder, if your PC simply isn't strong enough to run Dune Awakening, you can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-dune-awakening-fbc-firebreak-mindseye-and-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play it via GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Codemasters launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports F1 25</a>, this year's edition of the licensed Formula One racing game. This title actually supports the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite. On top of the aforementioned DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, the game also includes Ray Reconstruction, which can be enabled to replace the built-in denoiser to greatly enhance the quality of the ray tracing/<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path tracing</a>. NVIDIA says that enabling all DLSS technologies can multiply performance in F1 25 by an average of 7.9X at 4K with Ultra High settings and path tracing during a race around a wet Bahrain at night with 20 cars. The RTX 5090 breaks 372 frames per second, the RTX 5080 averages 246 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 206 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the GeForce Summer of RTX promotion <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/contests/summer-of-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is returning</a>. They encouraged users to follow GeForce and GeForce NOW accounts on social media to stay up to date on prize bundles featuring GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, GeForce RTX gaming PCs from Falcon Northwest, Maingear, and ORIGIN, and even more prizes coming later this season. Also, they are kicking off a new promotion titled RTX Watch &amp; Win: when new trailers drop during the biggest shows like the upcoming Summer Game Fest, participants have a chance to win Steam gift cards via NVIDIA's social pages.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Echoes of Elysium doesn't begin the way you'd expect a survival game to begin. At least, you don't physically start where you'd expect to be in a survival game. Mostly, you'd expect to be plopped into a forest of some sort, with nothing but trees and possibilities in front of you.</p>
<p>The possibilities part remains, but instead of trees, you enter into the world of Echoes of Elysium on a ship, floating in the sky, ready for you to get everything moving. Starting high in the sky is jarring, if nothing else, and it immediately sets your relationship with the opening hours of Elysium in a different light than your relationship with the opening hours of most survival games.</p>
<p>That's because it's pretty cool. Your mileage may vary on how much you like that, but at least when I first looked around at a big blue sky, with flying islands on the horizon and crafting materials floating upwards through the air, I thought it was a cool way to kick off a survival game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I also have a sense that any game that starts you off with a jetpack can't be that bad, but this whole opening, while cool, is where the issues with its setting immediately appear.</p>
<p>As part of its inclusion in the June 2025 Steam Next Fest, I got to check out the demo for Echoes of Elysium ahead of the demo's release. I want to say off the top that there is plenty I like about Echoes of Elysium, and I know that this is just a slice of a game that, when it does arrive, will launch into early access.</p>
<p>It's not going to be finished, it's going to evolve and change, and everything I might have a problem with could be gone from the game in a year. Also, the version I've been playing in this demo is specifically focused on building and crafting, so there's not much to do beyond exploring, gathering resources, and building your ship.</p>
<p>That said, as jarring and exciting as it is to begin your journey already in the sky, it's just as jarring when I started to feel the pain points with being anchored entirely to your ship, with the game's current pacing structure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can't go anywhere. At least, at the beginning, you can't. Your ship has no fuel, so you need to go through a multistep process to make fuel, and then you can fly around, and still get nowhere. Your ship moves so slowly when you start that it might as well not be moving. And when you get to the islands, at least in this demo, there isn't much to do.</p>
<p>The saving grace is the fact that you can perform this bunny-hop with the jetpack, by using it to gain some distance and then cutting it to rebuild stamina while you fall for a short time, and then activating your jetpack again. Executed correctly, you'll never run out of stamina and can travel longer distances than you probably should be capable of without a ship. But at least it's faster than your ship.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to being slow, which is the fact that the game is easy on the eyes. The art style reminds me of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-falconeer-stuck-holding-pattern/">The Falconeer</a>, a game I loved playing primarily because it was nice to just calmly fly around and take in the sights. I can still appreciate that in Echoes of Elysium, but it would also be nice to get somewhere, even in the demo, just to see a glimpse even, of what it looks like to be tens or even hundreds of hours in, with a more complete ship and everything else the game has to offer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and maybe I am, but the truth is that nothing I've played so far in Echoes of Elysium has me extremely worried, or thinking that the game is bad. I just think even with this version of the game that's just focused on building and crafting, it's too slow to start, and that developer Loric Games will need some time to build it and work out pacing issues.</p>
<p>I think it has a very strong foundation and is already shaping up to be a pretty good game, to be clear, that has a strong setting and a good art style. On a conceptual level, I appreciate that you're anchored to your ship and that your experience in the game depends almost entirely on how much time you put into making your ship exactly the way you want it.</p>
<p>Everything funnels into making your ship, or (eventually) ships, exactly how you want them. It's nice to immediately have a connection to your base of operations in that way, and I felt immediately engaged in wanting to play longer just to build up my ship, rather than explore more of the narrative or do plenty of quests. Not that there's a lot of that in this demo, or any, from what I saw, but my time with the demo was perpetually looped within its opening hours.</p>

<figure></figure>


<p>I hit several bugs that soft-locked my progression and made me restart my game, which didn't always fix them, a couple of freezes, and a hard crash back out to my desktop. Things like enemies and resources clipping into the ground on islands, my ship clipping into the bottom of an island, which meant I couldn't reach it when I jumped off of it (I also couldn't pilot it out). Location-based text that did not disappear from the middle of the screen, well after I had left the location; these were all issues that happened at least twice, but nothing bothered me too much. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644050/Echoes_of_Elysium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an early access title</a>, it's not going to be perfect, and while I saw all these issues, they weren't ruining gameplay sessions by happening constantly in the time I put into the demo.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes of Elysium Official GDC 2025 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UvaqEWEL10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</p>
