			<p>PlayStation is fully committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with their content and services, but this new method will hardly be limited to cloud gaming.</p>
<p>Speaking during an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor-focused interview</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino was asked directly about the future of the company, starting with cloud gaming, which has seen an increase in popularity in the past few years. While PlayStation has been in the cloud gaming business for the last 11 years, deploying cloud gaming services since the PlayStation 3 generation, Nishino-san highlighted how the cloud gaming business model has to be sustainable for the long-term growth, and despite the technological advancements of the past few years, the SIE CEO believes that the vast majority of players will continue to want a traditional experience based on local hardware, without depending on the network conditions, which are an unpredictable variable. From this statement, it's clear how the next PlayStation will be a traditional console, but interestingly enough, Nishino-san highlighted how they are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with the company's content and services, a statement that seems to hint at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">unannounced handheld</a> that is reportedly in the works.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the new and enhanced way for players to engage with content and services, Sony Interactive Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst touched upon the company's multiplatform strategy, saying that they're being thoughtful about bringing their franchises off consoles to reach a new audience, especially regarding single player games, which are considered as the point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are the real showcase of the performance and quality of the hardware, so the company is constantly thinking hard about how and if these titles are brought to other platforms. As such, it seems like the current strategy of late PC ports for single-player games will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>While ports of PlayStation Studios' developed games are likely to continue releasing on PC years after their console debut, that doesn't seem to be the case with games that are only published by the company. Shift Up's Stellar Blade launched on PC only a year after its console debut, and Lost Soul Aside will be launching simultaneously on PC and console this August. Hopefully, the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">success of Stellar Blade on PC</a> will compel PlayStation to focus more on the PC market in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is set to revolutionize music handling in open-world games, if a well-known music producer's recent revelations are true.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newrorynmal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Rory and Mal</a> show, Grammy-winning music producer Jermaine Dupri surprisingly revealed that artists will be able to upload their music directly to an unspecified Grand Theft Auto game. While the music producer did not specifically mention Grand Theft Auto VI, there's no way this feature would get added to the fifth entry in the series so late after its release, so there's little doubt that this will be a feature in the game launching next year on consoles. Jermain Dupri also added that the rapper Drake will have his own radio station, and from his understanding, the rapper himself could upload music to the game that is not available anywhere, something that would turn Grand Theft Auto VI into a music streaming service like Spotify and the like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jermaine Dupri, Ray Vaughn, Claressa Shields &amp; More Join us at the BET Awards Pt. 1 | NEW RORY &amp; MAL" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le8zt-XrrNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While we have to take all the above with a huge grain of salt, it would definitely make sense for Rockstar Games to do something like this for Grand Theft Auto VI, considering how music has always been important in every entry in the series, and how the game is setting out to be the most successful game release of all time. I personally hope the option, if real, will be available to a wide variety of artists, as nothing would beat going around the game's beautiful world with some pumping rock and metal tunes, bringing back to mind the days of roaming about Vice City with Iron Maiden's 2 Minutes to Midnight, Megadeth's Peace Sells and Ozzy Osbourne's Bark at the Moon playing in the background.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a> worldwide.</p>

			<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade has finally launched, around thirteen months after the game's or<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iginal debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a>. This version is also published by Sony and as such, it's interesting to compare its early player figures against other recent Sony-published games that made it to the PC platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3489700/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already more than doubled any previous single player games published by Sony on Valve's store when it comes to concurrent user peak. The action title peaked at 183.8K players around nineteen hours ago, with the potential to go even higher as we head into the weekend, when gamers have more time to play.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> the previous record earlier this year with 77.1K, although it should be clarified that the game also includes a multiplayer coop mode, Legends. As such, it might be more appropriate to consider Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 73.5K players, the previous record holder. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered reached a peak of 66.4K players; Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition stopped at 56.5K, while its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, peaked at 40.4K players. The Last of Us Part I registered 36.4K concurrent players on Steam, narrowly beating God of War Ragnarok (35.6K), The Last of Us Part II Remastered (30.6K), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (28.1K), and Days Gone (27.4K). All the others are much lower in the chart. Interestingly, all the first installments registered higher peaks than their sequels.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is certainly an acclaimed title, having sold enough to warrant a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>. That said, some of the other games mentioned above have rated even higher, despite reaching lower concurrent players on Steam. This new record might be surpassed soon, though, as the next Sony-published PC game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, will release on the same day as on consoles (August 29). It will be the first single-player game published by Sony to launch day and date on PC, and that might be enough to raise interest in the game, provided that it reviews well enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>
