			<p>We found out <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/">earlier this year</a> that Stellar Blade would be arriving on PC this June, but we didn't have a specific release date at the time.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to someone at PlayStation hitting the 'publish' button a tad early on the company's official YouTube account, we know that Stellar Blade will be available on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store on <strong>June 11, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The trailer was posted to the official PlayStation YouTube account and removed shortly after, but not before it could be downloaded and posted to the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">Reddit page</a>, where you can still check it out.</p>
<p>Besides the release date, the trailer shows off Stellar Blade running on PC, and confirms that it will support NVIDIA's DLSS 4 AI upscaling and AMD's FSR 3. It also confirms that the PC version will support ultra-wide displays and that you'll be able to play it with full DualSense haptics and adaptive trigger support.</p>
<p>We also get a quick look at a new boss battle players will be able to tackle, 25 new outfits added for the game's protagonist Eve, and some shots of the better textures and graphical features PC players will be able to enjoy, assuming, of course, they have the hardware to do so. Also, while the trailer doesn't explicitly confirm it, PS5 players should expect the new boss fight and outfits to come to the console version when the PC version releases in June.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the most anticipated action games of 2024, impressing players with its intense combat and stunning visuals. When it debuted on console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Wccftech's reviewer Kai Tatsumoto called Stellar Blade</a> "<em>a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em>"</p>

			<p>Blades of Fire is due to arrive next week at the time of writing, launching on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 22, 2025. But if you wanted to give Blades of Fire a go ahead of that launch, developer MercurySteam and publisher 505 Games have announced that a demo will be made available "<em>soon</em>" on all platforms ahead of next week's launch.</p>
<p>The studio posted <a href="https://x.com/Blades_of_Fire/status/1921943453123899660">a short video on X</a> featuring clips of players commenting that they want a demo to try the game out before jumping into the full release, and MercurySteam is making it happen. The studio hasn't said when the demo will be available, though with the game releasing towards the end of next week, it's likely it'll arrive a few days prior to help build excitement towards the game's full launch.</p>
<p>Revealed just months ago, the narrative-driven fantasy action game puts all its focus on the weapons you use and how well you know how to use them, meaning you won't be able to rely on stat upgrades and endgame-strength weaponry to make it through even late-game encounters in Blades of Fire. Your <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/">skills and knowledge of the weapons</a> in the game will get you through to the credits more than anything else.</p>
<p>Even though we've only known about Blades of Fire for a short time, the game is catching plenty of eyes. It was a pleasant and unexpected surprise during this year's GDC, where we got to go hands-on with the game about a month after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/">spending an hour with Blades of Fire at the conference</a>, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote, "It's<em> just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven't seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I'd still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd</em>."</p>
