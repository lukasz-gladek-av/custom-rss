			<p>We're now exactly ten days away from the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Xbox Developer Direct, the yearly January virtual event where Microsoft shares new details and footage on some of its upcoming first-party games.</p>
<p>As always, Microsoft outlined most of the lineup beforehand. We know the hotly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> prequel by id Software will be there, for example. We might even get a release window, as there's a solid chance that the first-person shooter powered by the latest version of the id Tech engine will be launched in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The new intellectual property from Canadian studio Compulsion Games (Contrast, We Happy Few) will be there, too. <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> is an action/adventure game where players will step into a Southern Gothic fantasy setting heavily based on Southern American folklore. As Hazel, a young heroine who can weave magic for traversal and combat, players must confront various mythical creatures to protect her loved ones and repair the tears in the so-called Grand Tapestry. The game's use of stop-motion animation certainly makes it look very unique.</p>
<p>This year's Xbox Developer Direct will also include a third-party game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>. It's not the first time (last year, the show included Square Enix's Visions of Mana), and we're not complaining anyway as the game looks very interesting, both in its story premise (all those of a certain age, in this case 33, are at risk of dying because of the mysterious Painter) and in its real-time elements to spruce up the regular turn-based JRPG combat. The game will be included with the Game Pass subscription service at launch, so it makes sense for Xbox to show it off there.</p>
<p>But the most intriguing tidbit is that Microsoft promised to also have fans virtually visit a 'surprise location' to see another studio's 'brand new game'. Since then, fans have been wildly speculating about what it could be, and now Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jezcorden.com/post/3lfeu6ablnk2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he thinks the Xbox Developer Direct will be 'much bigger' than Microsoft has so far let on. The only way for that to happen is for this mystery game to be a really big one.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't seem like it could be coming from an internal Xbox studio. Most of them are already busy with known projects, except perhaps Double Fine, whose latest game is 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychonauts 2</a>. Their titles rarely qualify as 'really big,' though. Perhaps Contraband from Avalanche Studios is finally ready to be shown, over three years and a half after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>. Back then, Avalanche CEO Pim Holfve&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-ceo-it-made-sense-to-choose-xbox-for-contraband-due-to-the-grandness-of-the-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> they partnered with Microsoft because of the project's 'grandness' - might that be about to come to fruition? Or could the mystery game be something else entirely? We'll know in ten days.</p>

			<p>When Game of Thrones Kingsroad was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-an-action-adventure-rpg-set-in-westeros-but-its-only-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased</a> at The Game Awards 2024, I didn't go easy on it. As a big fan of G.R.R. Martin's magnum opus, I've coveted a proper, triple-A rendition for well over a decade. This, a mobile game first and foremost, clearly wasn't it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I feel about it, the game's development is progressing, and now Netmarble has shared a gameplay sneak peek that's definitely more promising than the previous trailer. We can see the clear inspiration from action/adventure games like the latest Assassin's Creed titles, and there's even Lady Olenna herself warning our main character, a noble who suddenly finds himself the heir to a minor House, that he 'gravely underestimates the game' the big Houses play.</p>
<p>Along with the brief gameplay video, Netmarble also announced a Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test kicking off in just a few days, on January 16, and running through January 22 in the United States, Canada, and select parts of Europe (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Ukraine, Denmark, Ireland, Romania, Finland, Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Croatia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania).</p>

<p>Signups are open on this page for Android and Windows PC. That's right, there will be a PC launcher to play the game on the platform. These are the required specs for the Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test:</p>

			<p>While Ubisoft has disappointed fans this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Assass</a>i<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">n's Creed Shadows release delay</a>, at least there's some new info about the title's first DLC.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft had recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/">announced another delay to the next AC project</a>, pushing it up to March 20, with the goal of providing a better game at launch. While Ubisoft's justification indeed sounds fishy, we won't dive into much, but things aren't looking good for the developer at all, as the firm is under a cost-reduction process and is already exploring potential sale options, putting the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows and the general franchise at stake. Out of all the negativity, there's something positive too, as we now have information about AC Creed Shadows' first DLC, reportedly called "Claws of Awaji.<em>"</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Interestingly, details about the DLC surfaced on the title's Steam page, but it has unfortunately been removed for now. Based on what Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/">reports</a>, here is the new description, which includes specifics about the first DLC of the title:</p>
<p><em>Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</em></p>
<p>The description indicates that we are looking at 10 hours of downloadable content featuring a new region, likely the titular "Awaji Island," along with additional weaponry, gear, and abilities. Moreover, it seems like this particular DLC might be confined to users who have pre-ordered the title, but this isn't certain for now. Given that Ubisoft has received massive backlash around such moves before and that the description has now been removed from Steam, the devs are probably working on switching up their choice of words.</p>
<p>We do hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows delivers on expectations, especially considering that the title has now been delayed several months from the original schedule. It would be certainly very bad for Ubisoft if it didn't, especially after the streak of unsuccessful launches it has gone through so far.</p>
