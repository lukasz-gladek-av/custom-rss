			<p>Do you remember that game from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Glowmade</strong> at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom ONL 2024</a></strong> that put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oykf2q9_LM"><strong>Geoff Keighley </strong>in its trailer</a> and looked like a more medieval version of <strong>Fall Guys</strong>? No? Well, to remind you (unless you're <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/">one of the 10 people playing it on Steam right now </a>who need no reminder), that game was <strong>King of Meat</strong>, a co-op party platformer that dropped four friends into a medieval, community-built obstacle course.</p>



<p>That's what King of Meat was, with 'was' being the keyword here, because today, Amazon and Glowmade announced on <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us">the game's official website</a> that its servers are going to get <strong>shut down</strong> on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. It has already been delisted from all storefronts, and anyone who did buy it, whether at its <strong>$30</strong> price or its more common sales prices, will be <strong>getting a refund</strong>.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on <strong>October 2, 2025,</strong> and while we can't know how popular it was on its console platforms, SteamDB can tell us that it never had more than <strong>320</strong> people playing it at one time, a number that it didn't even hit at launch, but a month after launch, during a free weekend trial period. Its 24-hour peak currently sits at 10 players.</p>



<p>Depressing as these numbers may be to read, they are, according to Amazon and Glowmade's statement, the reason the game is getting shut down. "<em>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has <strong>unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for</strong>. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat's servers will close on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders</em>." </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The statement is then followed by a message written in all-caps, which reads, "<em>All players who purchased King of Meat <strong>will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider</strong>."</em> So whether you jumped in at launch, hoping this would be the next big multiplayer game, or gave it a shot after its free trial weekend, you'll be getting your money back.</p>



<p>Amazon and Glowmade have also turned off the game's microtransactions, so the only thing left to do in King of Meat is to enjoy the game if you already own a copy of it.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We're grateful for Glowmade's partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future</em>," Amazon concludes. </p>



<p>When King of Meat was first announced at Gamescom 2024, we got the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-gamescom-2024-qa-it-is-an-obvious-good-fit-for-streaming-streamers-really-enjoyed-it/">preview the game and speak to the development team at Glowmade</a>. Even at the time, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo identified that despite its run-of-the-mill gameplay, its capacity for user-generated content could be the thing that established King of Meat as a must-play multiplayer game. </p>



<p>The studio even seemed to imply that it was built as a game that could be extremely popular on Twitch, adding that "<em>It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming</em>," and that the studio had "<em>a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it.</em>"</p>



<p>Clearly, its strategy of designing for content creators and streaming, and seemingly relying on influencers to help get the game going, did not pan out. Even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drt0O2U8DY">Mr. Beast collab</a> that arrived just as the game launched was unable to do anything for it.</p>



<p>There's been no word from the Glowmade team as to how it is moving forward from here, though the website's statement does seem to imply its partnership with Amazon has concluded. Hopefully, the studio is able to come together around its next project, because whatever your thoughts on King of Meat, it's clear that, despite missing the mark with this game, Glowmade is an extremely capable studio. We'll see if they get another kick at the can.</p>
