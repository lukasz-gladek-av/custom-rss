			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-netflix-anime-series/">2020</a>, we learned that Ubisoft was teaming up with Netflix to produce an animated Splinter Cell TV series adaptation. Now, five years later, that adaptation, titled Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, will finally premiere this coming October 14, 2025. But as far as a new game in the series is concerned, or even when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">previously announced remake is coming</a>? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>



<p>Netflix debuted the first official trailer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch yesterday, alongside its release date, featuring an older Sam Fisher getting back into his three-eyed night vision goggles alongside a new Splinter Cell agent for a new generation, Zinnia McKenna. Fisher is being voiced by Liev Schreiber instead of his original voice actor, Michael Ironside, while McKenna is played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4A9iFjaKeMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The story of Deathwatch follows Fisher getting back into the fight thanks to a personal connection, after McKenna seeks his help. A larger plot unfolds, and a much older Fisher than the one we knew in the core games finds himself back in the thick of it.</p>



<p>It seems like a fairly solid foundation for an interesting story, but that's not all fans of the Splinter Cell franchise are looking for. A new animated show is great, but everyone is waiting on a new game.</p>



<p>Stealth games like the original Splinter Cell series are few and far between nowadays, and a new game in the series is well overdue. Hopefully, we'll actually hear something about a new game in the series within the next year, or at the very least the coming remake, if we're not going to get a brand new entry in the series.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Splinter Cell fans who are taking whatever morsels of information they can, can try to tide themselves over with the coming animated series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's not unfair to say that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been through the videogame development wringer. There was a time when we thought the game would never be released, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/telltale-games/">Telltale</a> famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">went bankrupt and shut down</a>. Then the studio was brought back to life, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">hope was restored</a> for new Telltale titles, and development on The Wolf Among Us 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-development-reboot-unreal/">was restarted</a>. </p>



<p>But that was five years ago, and it's been three years since we heard that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-official-trailer-will-launch-in-2023/">game was supposed to arrive in 2023</a>. Then it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-beyond-2023-unreal-engine-5/">delayed out of 2023</a>, and in the time since, we've only gotten some <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-ue5-screenshots/">nice-looking screenshots</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/">Telltale's word</a> to make us believe that the game is still in development.</p>



<p>It's all taken far longer than anyone might've initially thought it would, and one former writer at Telltale, Nick Herman, who has long since moved on from the studio to be a co-founder of AdHoc, a team formed by Herman and other former Telltale developers who are due to release their newest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">Dispatch, in October</a>, has shed a bit of light on what happened with this game's prolonged development.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">Eurogamer</a> about Dispatch, Herman tried to answer why the AdHoc team, which was working alongside Telltale to make The Wolf Among Us 2 at the time, stopped working on the game and moved on to Dispatch. Herman also offered a potentially reassuring note, saying that in his mind, what they had written was better than the first game, and if it ever made it into players' hands, "<em>people would love it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Look, the truth is</em>," Herman began before another former Telltale developer and AdHoc co-founder, Pierre Shorette, interjected in what seems to have been a coy way, since Eurogamer states he did it with a smile, saying, "<em>Yeah why did we stop working on that, Nick?</em>" </p>



<p>Herman continued, saying, "<em>We wrote a season, Season Two. We think it's better than Season One - and we were on Season One. And yeah, we're really proud of it. We were doing tests. We were in cinematics and animation and stuff. And then basically they needed more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>They weren't… We weren't running the project. It was Telltale we were doing it in partnership with. And we couldn't wait around and do nothing, so we had to move on to Dispatch to keep the studio moving, and they needed to go their own way.</em> <em>We're looking forward to seeing what they do with it</em>. <em>I don't know how much of our version of the script is going to make it into what they end up making. But if one day we were able to make the thing that we wrote and were in the middle of directing, we think people would love it. So, you know, good luck</em>."</p>



<p>At this point, only those inside Telltale can really tell the tale of what's going on with the studio now and The Wolf Among Us 2's development. Hopefully, it's a story that has a good ending, one where the game does cross the finish line, and lives up to players' expectations.</p>
