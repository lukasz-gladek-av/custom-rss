			<p>A new Frame Generation mod for Fallout 4 was released yesterday <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. As you probably remember, modder PureDark released Frame Generation mods for Bethesda's open world RPG, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-dlss-3-mod-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for NVIDIA DLSS</a> and then for AMD FSR, over two years ago. However, PureDark's mods are still locked behind the paywall of having to be a Patreon subscriber of his.</p>



<p>This mod, on the other hand, is completely free of charge. Created by doodlum, the main coder behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite, it is the modder's second submission after <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-gets-perfect-skies-graphics-mod-long-15-quest-mod-due-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies for Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 2025 Modathon</a>, a Nexus Mods competition among modders that started on October 23 (Fallout Day) and ends on December 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Doodlum's Fallout 4 Frame Generation mod is powered by AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology, more specifically through the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available</a> AMD FidelityFX SDK GPUOpen API, and thus uses a DLL signed by AMD. It works through a custom-made DirectX 12 swap chain proxy and is compatible with any DirectX 12-capable graphics card, which is not surprising given that it relies on AMD FSR 3.</p>



<p>The modder says Frame Generation can smooth performance in the most demanding scenarios, such as in cities. Moreover, mods like the popular Sim Settlements 2 can further increase the CPU load, making Frame Generation even more important. You can view a brief video comparison between Fallout 4 vanilla and with this mod installed below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>By default, the mod only enables itself when detecting monitors with a refresh rate of at least 120Hz; however, users can force it to be enabled in the .ini file.</p>



<p>The mod requires Address Library for F4SE Plugins and High FPS Physics Fix, and also for you to set Fallout 4 to Borderless or Windowed mode in the game's launcher. It is compatible with ENB and also with PureDark's free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 upscaler mod</a>, provided you set the latter to DLAA or native AA. It does not, however, work with the VR version of the game, though that's not an issue since VR's spacewarp already provides a similar and more effective frame generation technique.</p>



<p>Fallout 4 just celebrated its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its original launch</a> with the release of a new Anniversary Edition (which broke a lot of mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting some users to revert to the previous version</a>). In other Fallout news, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> both a Fallout 3 and a Fallout: New Vegas remaster are in the works at Bethesda.</p>
