			<p>EA has confirmed that it will fully reveal EA Sports FC 26, the next entry in its annual football simulation series, later this week, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. It has also revealed one of the cover athletes for this year to be iconic Swedish player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who will appear on the cover of the Ultimate Edition of the game. </p>

<p>Zlatan is being added as an icon item in the game, adding him to the roster of legendary footballers to have their careers celebrated in EA Sports FC. Though there's no official release date yet for EA Sports FC 26, veteran players of the series should expect it to fall where it usually does in the year, which is sometime in the early fall, more specifically in September. </p>

<p>If you want to catch up on the state of the EA Sports FC series, you can try out last year's entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">EA Sports FC 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, since it joined the service just last month. Not that EA particularly wants players, or anyone, really, to look back on last year's entry. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-ceo-explains-why-fc-25-failed-to-meet-financial-expectations/">EA Sports FC 25 missed its financial targets</a>, a huge blow to the company that relies on its annual sports games to make up the bulk of its revenue. While it saw huge success with the return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football</a>, the main breadwinner for EA has always been its football series and the live service side of it, Football Ultimate Team (FUT).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA shut down projects and laid off developers at Respawn</a>, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">shut down the studio it built to make a new Black Panther game</a>, cancelling the game. It's difficult to imagine that EA wouldn't make more cuts if it goes through another year of its flagship sports game missing its targets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Santa Monica has been working on *something* following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and co-creator of the God of War series and lead on the 2018 reboot of the series, Cory Barlog, has been leading a new project at the studio for some time. But we're still very short on any details regarding what's next for the studio.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been pretty mute on the subject of Sony Santa Monica's new game, but we do seem to have a small update on how things are going. In a thread on ResetEra, Bloomberg reporter and video game industry insider Jason Schreier responded to a question regarding SSM's next game and Cory Barlog's new project. </p>



<p>"<em>Cory Barlog's game is SSM's next big thing</em>," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-394#post-142651128">Schreier responded</a>. "<em>Last time I spoke to anyone about it (a month or two ago) it was going well.</em>" That doesn't tell us very much at all, but at least its a sign that things are in a good place at Sony Santa Monica regarding Barlog and his team's new game.</p>



<p>Schreier's next comment, however, is what made players raise their eyebrows as to whatever this next game is. The prevailing rumor about SSM's next big game <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/">has been that it is a brand new IP</a>, a big deal for a studio that has only made God of War games for its entire existence. After his comments on how things are going started to make the rounds on social media, and players expressed their excitement for a new IP from SSM,<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-396#post-142655865"> Schreier followed up by asking</a>, "<em>Why does everybody think Barlog's game is a new IP?</em>"</p>



<p>Just asking the question doesn't insinuate one way or the other about Sony Santa Monica's next game being a new IP. But it does leave some doubt regarding previous rumors about Barlog's next project being the studio's first deviation from the God of War series. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see what Sony Santa Monica and Barlog's team has been cooking, though who knows when PlayStation will be ready to talk about it. </p>



<p>The other major rumor circulating the God of War studio is that there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War</a> game coming. That project, supposedly, could be announced any day now, as it was claimed earlier this year that it was due to be revealed. </p>
