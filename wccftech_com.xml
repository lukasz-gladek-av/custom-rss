			<p>A few months ago, Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced path traced global illumination to the PC version of War Thunder</a>, significantly improving visual quality over the game's previous ray traced global illumination solution. </p>



<p>In doing so, War Thunder joined an extremely elite club of games that feature real-time path tracing: <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rt-overdrive-mode-is-the-new-pinnacle-of-graphics-and-performance-on-an-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, DESORDRE, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-pc-performance-benchmarks-nvidia-dlss-3-5-path-tracing-photorealistic-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, Black Myth: Wukong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-path-tracing-incredible-performance-cost-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F1 25</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages (whose developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-tracing-took-six-months-to-implement-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just opened on on their path tracing implementation</a>), and FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's second game on this list.</p>



<p>We contacted Gaijin to organize an email interview that would dive deeply into this tech advancement for War Thunder and the whole Dagor Engine (also used in other games published by the studio, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/enlisted-devs-talk-about-crossplay-progression-system-and-dx12-ultimate-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MMOFPS Enlisted</a>). At last, we received the responses back, courtesy of Anton Yudintsev (co-founder of Gaijin Entertainment), László Perneky (lead programmer), and Gergo Horvath (programmer). You can find them after the embedded footage.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="War Thunder 4K HDR Full Ray Tracing - USA Tank Crew &amp; Sound Mod RWSM IV Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oArxTRcbGW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>How long did it take for you to implement Path Traced Global Illumination in the Dagor Engine? Was it complex to go from ray tracing to path tracing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> The ray tracing framework we have is very flexible. We can reconstruct any surface on the whole map with quality very close to rasterized ones, and we keep the ray traced scene in sync with the rasterized scene. With this at our disposal, the first working prototype went fast, in just a couple of weeks. But then the devil is in the details. We had to make sure the results were good in all cases. When rendering airplane cockpits, you need special considerations compared to rendering a tank from behind. We needed to prepare PTGI for all the cases the player can encounter.</p>



<p>Performance is also a big concern. PTGI replaces RT ambient occlusion, which gives us some headroom but is also much heavier, so we needed to make tons of small decisions on optimizations. In the end, we spent about a month on the initial version, but we are still tweaking/refining it ever since.</p>



<p><strong>Will the open source version of the Dagor Engine be updated with path tracing support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Probably by the end of the year.</p>



<p><strong>Do you consider the Leviathan update to have added the final version of PTGI, or do you believe there is still room for improvement? If so, is it for quality, performance, or both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> There is almost always room for improvement for both quality and performance. While the idea of Path Tracing itself is “uber-solution”, implying that we achieve the best possible result by tracing lighting data for each pixel, in reality, a naive approach would be prohibitively slow (~8 million rays with few bounces each), so virtually all real-time solutions use some form of temporal upscaling and so, some kind of denoising. And that would be an area of improvement for visual quality. Also, each game uses its own set of tricks for achieving faster ray-tracing itself (especially for foliage, etc). Performance-wise, it is always possible to do something, although eventually, efforts start to provide diminishing returns. That said, we are rather satisfied with both quality and performance for such quality achieved.</p>



<p><strong>You wrote that you are planning to add support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-ada-lovelaces-opacity-micro-maps-feature-and-how-it-can-boost-ray-tracing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM)</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ada-lovelace-follow-up-qa-dlss-3-ser-omm-dmm-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shader Execution Reordering (SER)</a>. How much of a performance boost do you expect from those additions? Also, do you have an ETA on when they might be introduced to War Thunder?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, both are underway. For SER, we need to change our ray generation method, as to use it, there are some constraints, like you can’t use it in compute shaders. For OMM, we already have a working prototype, and while it doesn’t do wonders, it brings decent improvement in tracing performance, especially with areas with denser foliage. Microsoft recently made both of these features part of the core Direct3D system. We are still waiting for the final GPU drivers with support for these technologies. But by the time those arrive, we can probably finish the work on them in Dagor and War Thunder and release these features early next year.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about DirectX's Work Graphs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-cpu-bottlenecks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to developers a year and a half ago</a>)? Are they as important as Microsoft is claiming? Will you implement them for your engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> This is the long-awaited step to a more GPU-driven rendering pipeline. In some cases, it can provide significant GPU workload optimization and almost always free some CPU. Unfortunately, its benefits are only possible on rather new hardware. We do want to implement Work Graphs support as well in the upcoming years.</p>

<p><strong>Could PS5 Pro support some version of path tracing? Also, do you have any future improvements coming to the PS5 Pro version, and if so, which ones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</p>



<p><strong>Are you adding AMD FSR 4 support at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gergo Horvath:</strong> FSR4 is a high priority for us as it is an often-requested feature from players. We have had some divergence regarding upscaling and frame generation technologies supported by each of the games. Even though they are using the same engine. We had XeSS-FG and XeLL added to WT as well as AMD FSR3 with frame generation to War Thunder and now Enlisted is lagging behind. We are planning to remedy the situation by converging support of these technologies in all of our games by the end of the year, and AMD FSR4 will also be part of that package for PC. If and when FSR4 would be available for consoles we will already be ready.</p>



<p><strong>Will Enlisted also receive a PTGI update? If so, is there an ETA?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Yes, it is planned to have PTGI in Enlisted as well – internally, we do have a running version with it already. Although our current GI solution is giving very similar results to PTGI with significantly higher performance, it is always good to be able to compare to the “ground truth” solution. We aim to release it this year, though no hard deadline yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is out now, and it's being sold like hotcakes. Are you considering a Switch 2 port for War Thunder and/or Enlisted?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 23 Jobs with unique abilities that determine what each Job can do. With so many choices available and ample customization options, choosing the best Jobs to win battles with ease can be overwhelming. With our tier list, however, you can easily learn which Jobs provide the highest damage and the best utility.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, but the ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings.</strong></em></p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job tier list. Created with <a href="https://tiermaker.com/">TierMaker</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Top-tier Jobs. Extremely versatile, powerful, or broken. They excel in multiple roles and remain strong throughout the game.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Strong Jobs. Very effective in most situations but slightly less versatile or powerful than S-tier. </td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Mid-tier Jobs. Situationally strong and useful.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Low-tier Jobs. Supportive with limited usability, but solid as secondary Jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Bottom-tier Job. Outclassed by every other Job.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Ninja is among the best Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ninja</strong> - The king of physical damage. Thanks to its unrivaled speed growth and innate Dual Wield ability (allowing two attacks per turn), the Ninja can act first and deliver very high damage. In addition, the Dual Wield support ability is the most crucial skill for nearly every physical-focused endgame build. Its only drawback is its low HP, making it a glass cannon that constantly needs support.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Monk</strong> - An indispensable, versatile physical Job. The Monk is a self-sufficient Job that needs no weapons to deal massive damage, as its attacks scale with its excellent Physical Attack and Brave stats. Its Martial Arts skill set is among the game's best utility kits, offering free, instant-cast healing and MP regeneration (Chakra), resurrection (Revive), and ranged physical attacks (Aurablast/Shockwave).</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetician</strong> - One of the most broken Jobs in the game. Its unique Arithmetic skill allows for instant-cast, map-wide magic with zero MP cost, bypassing casting time and range limits. It requires heavy JP investment and a high-Faith unit, so it takes more effort to make it effective than Ninja and Monk. Although its damage has been nerfed in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the Arithmetician is still a devastating Job that can clear entire maps solo with the proper setup.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Samurai offers superior versatility in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Samurai</strong> - A powerful hybrid job. While its physical attacks are standard, though they can be improved with the Doublehand Support Ability, the Iaido Job Command provides versatile magic-based abilities like area-of-effect healing, elemental damage, and buffs without consuming MP, at the potential cost of the katana used to activate the skill. Its signature Reaction Ability, Shirahadori, grants high evasion rates against physical attacks, making it a staple for any build.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Chemist </strong>- The most efficient support class in the game, available from the start. The Item Job Command has zero casting time and can instantly heal, restore MP, or revive allies from a distance, bypassing the Faith mechanics and casting times of spells. The Auto-Potion Reaction Ability and the Support Ability Throw Item are crucial for survivability, making the Chemist a great choice as a secondary Job as well.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Black Mage</strong> - The main offensive spellcaster in the game, specializing in high-damage, area-of-effect elemental magic. The Black Mage has the best Magic Attack growth among the standard magic-based Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, allowing its spells to deal massive damage throughout the adventure. Its main weakness is the long casting time, which may cause involuntary friendly fire. Its Magic Attack Up Support Ability is also essential for every other magic-based Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Time Mage</strong> - The master of turn manipulation. The Time Mage's abilities, such as Haste and Slow, are critical for gaining a decisive advantage. Support ability Swiftness is a fundamental ability for any serious spellcaster, although less than in other versions of the game due to faster casting time for some spells. The Movement Ability Teleport, which ignores height and terrain restrictions, provides excellent mobility that works great for most Jobs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Although far from being one of the best Jobs, the Dancer is a solid choice in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Geomancer </strong>- A highly versatile class that uses Geomancy, which are instant-cast spells tied to the terrain. These spells always hit, can inflict a variety of status effects, and scale off of both Physical Attack and Magic Attack while ignoring Faith, which is great for hybrid builds. The Attack Up Support Ability is an essential skill for all physical damage-based classes.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mystic </strong>- A magic caster specializing in Mystic Arts, spells that inflict status effects and permanently raise or lower a unit's Bravery and Faith stats. Although it falls off during the late game due to an optional, much better character, this Job works decently as a secondary Job for units with high Faith. The Defense Boost Support Ability also gives it better survivability on the frontlines.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dancer </strong>- A special female-only class that uses Dance abilities to cast debuffs on all enemies with a 50% success rate. Though fragile and focused on support, some of the Dance abilities are extremely useful, such as Forbidden Dance to cause random status afflictions, and Last Waltz to reduce enemies' CT to 1. This makes the Dancer a solid choice in some scenarios where debuffing the enemy is more important than going straight for damage.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mime </strong>- A powerful but very situational Job that can learn no skill. The Mime's only action is to perfectly replicate the last non-Mime action taken by any friendly unit on the battlefield, which makes them devastating if paired with an Arithmetician, but also tricky to use in scenarios where one isn't available. Its excellent stat growth is offset by its high unlock requirements.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dragoon </strong>- A physical fighter and excellent tank with high HP and access to heavy armor and shields. Their signature command, Jump, launches the unit into the air, making them untargetable for a short time before they come down for a powerful, high-range attack. Their low speed, Jump charge time, and lack of versatility, however, impact their usefulness compared to other physical-oriented Jobs that can deal more damage more quickly.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Summoner </strong>- A strong magic-based Job that can deal elemental damage at a wider AoE than the Black Mage. The high charge time of some spells and their high MP cost, however, require way more upkeep than the Black Mage, resulting in a still viable, but less effective Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mediator </strong>- A unique support-focused Job that provides buffs and debuffs via the Speechcraft abilities and can naturally equip Guns. Though essential for recruiting monsters, there are Jobs that do what it does in a more effective way. </li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though generally useful, the White Mage is quickly outclassed by other Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>White Mage</strong> - A support-focused Job specializing in restorative and protective magic, offering single-target and AoE healing, defensive buffs, and even damage with the Holy spell. Although useful, a Magic Attack-focused Samurai build outclasses White Mages at what it does best, making it a good choice only for some experimental builds, like a Dragoon hybrid build that takes advantage of its solid speed growth to make Jump more effective.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Knight </strong>- A durable physical job with high HP, strong Physical Attack, and access to heavy armor and shields. The Arts of War abilities have some utility in certain scenarios, but other Jobs are more effective at debuffing without engaging enemies head-on. Also, a late-game special character's unique skills completely outclass the Arts of War abilities with guaranteed success, relegating endgame Knights to being tanks and not much else.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Thief</strong> - A high-speed, high-mobility Job whose Steal command is the only way to obtain some rare weapons and gears. Due to their low damage output and low HP, the Thief Job is a mediocre main Job, and works best as a secondary Job for other, better Jobs that can take better advantage of the Steal command and Movement +2 ability. </li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Squire</strong> - The starting job for all male units and the foundation for all physical melee classes, the Squire Fundamentals abilities can be put to great use by other Jobs, such as Focus for a Job like Monk. JP Boost, which increases Job Point gain, and Movement +1 are solid abilities for any Job, making the Squire a great secondary Job even in the late game. Its unspecialized nature and limited gear selection, however, make it a good choice as a main Job only at the beginning of the game.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bard </strong>- A special male-only class that uses Songs to cast buffs on all friendly units. Although not too different from the Dancer in function, debuffs have far more utility, making this Job worthwhile mainly to learn the Movement +3 ability, or in some special challenge runs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even with some buffs, the Archer remains one of the worst Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Archer</strong> - As the only Job capable of equipping Bows, the Archer can extend its attack range with height. Unfortunately, this Job falls off very quickly even during the early game, due to its average Aim Job Command, which requires time to charge an attack to deal increased damage, and the low damage of Bows and Crossbows. The Concentrate Support Ability, which prevents attacks from being evaded, and Adrenaline Rush Reaction Ability, which increases speed when the unit receives damage, have some utility, but they are too little to prevent the Archer from being the worst Job in the game.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-reportedly-preparing-to-launch-a-free-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming-with-ads.1315900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems that after hiking the prices for Xbox Game Pass by 50%, Microsoft isn't done making changes to its Xbox gaming services, as a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">The Verge</a> alleges that a new free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming is currently being internally tested, with a public test to be announced soon. The catch to this version being free is, unexpectedly, it'll be free *with ads.</p>



<p>How it'll work, according to The Verge, is that players will be able to stream free-to-play games, some games that players own, and a collection of Xbox Retro Classic titles. How the ads will work is that players will have to sit through two minutes of ads before they can stream a game, and they'll reportedly only get five free hours per month, in one-hour sessions.</p>



<p>It'll be available on PC, consoles, and handheld devices. The first public beta test is apparently coming "<em>soon</em>," with its full release set to be out "<em>in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>We've had hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Microsoft is looking to make Cloud Gaming "<em>more affordable</em>"</a> before, which could easily be seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">as the new price changes for Xbox Game Pass</a>. Yes, the price for the service went up by 50%, but you no longer have to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate to use Xbox Cloud Gaming, and can stream games through the cloud from the cheapest Essential tier.</p>



<p>This would go a step further, though it's worth considering who would be satisfied with one-hour sessions and a total of five hours across the span of a month. It feels like the kind of restriction that wouldn't exactly satisfy anyone who would want to stream games in the first place, pushing them to simply get an Essential Game Pass subscription for a reasonable experience.</p>



<p>Regardless, even with this tier being free, it's doubtful this would be met with enthusiasm and positivity from players. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">console price hike</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">removal of cost-saving features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts for subscribers</a>, now likely followed by more ads being pushed in front of players just trying to play some games don't exactly make for a winning public reception. </p>
