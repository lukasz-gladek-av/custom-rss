			<p>A new Dark Souls 3 mod now in development promises to rejuvenate the game's multiplayer mechanics in the same way a similar mod does in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LukeYui</a>, the developer behind the Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod released a while back, is currently working on a similar mod for the third entry in the now classic FromSoftware series, which will allow players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with friends from beginning to end with synchronized progress, no resummoning and optional invasions, essentially removing every vanilla multiplayer restriction. You can check out the seamless multiplayer experience coming in the future to Dark Souls 3 in the video below.</p>

<p>Despite the game having been released a while back, the Dark Souls 3 modding community continues to be extremely active and is continuing to introduce all sorts of improvements to the game. Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the excellent Bloodborne Remastered Project, recently released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-visual-overhaul/">visual overhaul mod</a> that carries over much of the work made on the emulated PlayStation 4 game to offer improvements that are worthy of an official remaster.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out our review.</p>
