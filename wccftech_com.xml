			<p>GeForce Now Thursday <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mafia-the-old-country">adds five new games to the cloud streaming service</a>, including Hangar 13's prequel entry into the Mafia series with Mafia: The Old Country, Grimlore Games' recent shadow drop of Titan Quest II, Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth, and more.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-grounded-2-mafia-the-old-country/">announced as being a part of GeForce Now just last week</a>, at the end of July ahead of its official launch tomorrow, and anyone wanting to jump into the Sicilian adventure who doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-pc-specs/">PC to stand up to its beefy requirements</a>, will be able to see the beautiful Sicilian countryside without issue. </p>



<p>That said, if you are going to try and run Mafia: The Old Country on your PC, then make sure you've downloaded the necessary drivers, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">latest ones just released from NVIDIA</a> to give yourself the best chance at a smooth experience.</p>

<p>Titan Quest II joins the service after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow dropped last week at THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> event for 2025, and has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">sold over 300K copies in less than three days</a> from its early access surprise launch. </p>



<p>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth is another addition that is practically launching into the service, though in its case, it is launching out of early access and into its 1.0 version, since the game's 1.0 update arrived just a couple of days prior to the time of this writing on August 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Stormgate was previously available to stream on GeForce Now, so technically it's only the 1.0 update that's a new addition. But a 1.0 launch for an early access game is akin to a second launch, which is why it still makes the list, even as the sixth entry on a list of five new games.</p>



<p>As for the remaining games that are totally brand new to the service, along with its arrival in <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/">Xbox Game Pass,</a> Assassin's Creed Mirage is joining the roster of games that can be streamed on GeForce Now through a Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>The five new games are then rounded out by the horror classic Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and fighting game HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of the new games added to GeForce Now today: </p>



<ul>
<li>Mafia: The Old Country</li>



<li>Titan Quest II</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage</li>



<li>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</li>



<li>HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT</li>



<li>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth v1.0</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to learn more about this week's headline game, Mafia: The Old Country, then you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">check out our review,</a> which just went live shortly before this post. Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked the game out, and noted it as a narrative-focused experience that succeeds in that endeavor while still having strong gameplay. </p>
