			<p>Bossa Games, previously known as Bossa Studios, has made the unfortunate decision to lay off more staff, with the previous round of redundancies happening at the end of 2023, leaving 40 employees behind to work on its upcoming project, Lost Skies. At the moment, it's uncertain how many staff have been impacted by this latest round of layoffs. The news broke when a statement was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> from Co-Founded and Co-CEO Henrique Olifiers. The full statement reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>The past couple of years have brought a significant amount of disruption to the games industry at large, with treasured studios, teams and games being shut down or significantly scaled back. We've all read the news, suffered through the changes ourselves or seen it through the eyes of peers and colleagues affected.</em></p>
<p><em>In our view, this is not a phase, it's a fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams. The industry of two years in the future will not look like the industry of two years ago.</em></p>
<p><em>We've had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we'll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>This means saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the games industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time. We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back our teams, but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, who undoubtedly are also fighting their own difficult battles, we wish you all the luck and resilience - and if you are in the enviable position to hire someone, we can't recommend anyone better than a former Bossian.</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">new gameplay trailer</a> for Lost Skies was released just two weeks ago, showcasing the floating islands and the traversal system that players will get to experiment with in the upcoming title. At the moment, Lost Skies still doesn't have a release date, so it's uncertain as to how long those excited for the game will have to wait for its release.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>
