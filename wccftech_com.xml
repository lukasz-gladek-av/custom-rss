            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>

			<p>Other years, it's a quiet period for Strategy and Simulation games, making it difficult to even put together a selection of the best games from the genre. Thankfully, that's not the case with 2025, as there were some excellent strategy and simulation games released this year.</p>



<p>Some of those releases even came from the most popular franchises in the strategy and simulation gaming genre. With that said, here are our picks for the Best Strategy and Simulation Games in 2025. Also, make sure to vote for your pick at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-10-10">Two Point Museum (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/">10/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tpm_tp-website_bg-image_3840x2160.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum. Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Two Point series of simulation and management games has always been about creating fun and engaging environments for players to enjoy. It's not about testing your management skills to the brink or making you stress over how your colony (or in this case, museum) is operating. It's about leaning into chaos and comedic moments that make these games enjoyable.</p>



<p>Two Point Museum is a masterclass of a Two Point game, as it strikes all of those points perfectly without missing a beat. It is a bright, accessible management game that will keep you engaged all through its campaign and even further beyond that with its sandbox mode. It's a wonderful accomplishment and easily one of the year's best strategy and simulation games.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's review puts it, "<em>There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-9-5-10">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-the-Ivalice-Chronicles.png"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles. Image credit: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is a return of a classic strategy game that fans have been dying for, and it absolutely did not disappoint when it arrived this past September. With the original Final Fantasy Tactics being known as one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series, and one of the best strategic role-playing games ever made, there was a lot of nostalgic weight on its shoulders <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">when it was finally announced</a>.</p>



<p>It kept the story that players loved and gave it a boost with the Enhanced version, adding some solid voice acting with only a few minor changes to the script, though if it's not to your liking, you can always jump back to Classic mode to play nearly the exact same game you would have played back in 1998. Of course, you miss out on the quality of life improvements made in the Enhanced version, but it's the fact that you have the option for both that really matters when it comes to a game so beloved as this.</p>



<p>The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't try to fix what isn't broken with the game's already excellent gameplay and Job system, and on the Enhanced version, lets you dive even deeper than was previously possible, with a bit of added difficulty, while still staying true to a core feature of the original: you can still break the game wide open if you can figure out how.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo put it in his review, "<em>Decades after its original release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles remains the golden standard for tactical role-playing games. Refined with excellent quality-of-life improvements that enhance its already deep gameplay and superb voice acting, the War of the Lions’ story and battles have never felt more engaging. While the modest visual overhaul and missing War of the Lions content may disappoint those seeking a true definitive edition, they are minor issues in an otherwise excellent reimagining.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sid-meier-s-civilization-vii-8-10">Sid Meier's Civilization VII (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Civilization VII. Image credit: 2K</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the arrival of Civilization VII has been a long time coming. Not as long, of course, seeing as how the last Civilization game arrived in 2016, but nearly a decade between releases is still a long time to wait, especially if you weren't enamoured with the DLCs that came after the full release.</p>



<p>Which is what made the arrival of Civilization VII such an event, and such a divisive one at that. Not everyone has loved the changes made in the latest entry in what is arguably the most popular (or at least well-known) 4X strategy game in the industry. At the time of this writing, it still has a "Mixed" rating for user reviews on Steam. That said, it doesn't fall so far that it's not a good Civilization game, and to still be a good game in a series of filled with excellent games means Civilization is an easy entry in our best strategy and simulation games of the year.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray put it in his review, "<em>Civilization VII is a great game, that's the simple answer. With an improved city-building system, terrain features, and diplomacy, there is much to like in the new release of the three-and-a-half decade old franchise. However, long-time fans of the series will find some of the omissions, such as the ability to turn off victory conditions other than domination, limiting. This, and the rapid nature of the ages, will also leave some feeling that the epic nature of some longer games is altogether missing. Still, even with the games feeling a little rushed, the one-more-turn that makes Civilization one of the best series ever remains there.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tempest-rising">Tempest Rising</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tempest-Rising.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tempest Rising. Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tempest Rising might just be Command &amp; Conquer with a bit of different paint, but that's not really something worth complaining about when Command &amp; Conquer is nowhere to be seen. Developer Slipgate Ironworks saw a gap in the RTS world, and while it didn't fill it entirely with everything Tempest Rising does, it went far enough to scratch the itch for C&amp;C fans that hasn't been scratched for a long time.</p>



<p>Though its multiplayer didn't launch with a lot of fanfare, and its story mode isn't able to reach some of the C&amp;C iconic highs of the series, Tempest Rising doesn't try to fix a system that isn't broken and still delivers the fast-paced RTS gameplay that kept C&amp;C fans engaged for over three decades. </p>



<p>It's more than a good time for RTS fans and a can-not-miss game for anyone still waiting for a new C&amp;C.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mount-and-Blade-II-Bannerlord-War-Sails-Interview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails. Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord had already established itself as one of the premier cinematic options for medieval gameplay and warfare simulation and strategy, with a solid campaign and a wonderfully built world since its 1.0 release in 2022. Now, five years after its initial release, TaleWorlds Entertainment has expanded on the game with its largest and most significant update yet, a naval expansion.</p>



<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the addition of War Sails changed the game for Mount &amp; Blade II. On top of changes to the map and to the layout of Caladria, adding a new battlefield that also adds new trade routes and ways for players to expand their empire has made an already strong game an even more complete offering.</p>



<p>As I said in my impressions of the expansion and the game when it arrived, "<em>War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers.</em>"</p>

			<p>Lords of the Fallen, the soulslike created by CI Games and Hexworks, is among the many hardcore action RPGs released in the past few years. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Even with some critical flaws</a></strong>, the game managed to capture the attention of fans of the genre with a unique dual world setup and a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"player first"</em> approach which became evident following the game's launch in September 2023. This approach led to the launch of multiple updates that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>addressed many of the game's launch flaws and added a significant amount of new features.</strong></a></p>



<p>The development of <a href="https://www.lordsofthefallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lords of the Fallen II</strong></a> seems to be anchored to a similar respect. While adding new features on top of the foundation led by its predecessor, the new game will respect player's time by providing an overall better experience right from launch.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">Following the gameplay reveal at this year's The Game Awards</a></strong>, we sat down with James Lowe, Game Director of Lords of the Fallen II, to discuss the sequel’s more brutal combat, the evolution of the Umbral realm, and the core philosophy guiding development this time around.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-brutality-of-dismemberment">The Brutality of Dismemberment</h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new feature that seems to define the game is the dismemberment system, which is a rare mechanic for a Soulslike. How did the idea for this system originally come about? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The dismemberment system grew out of a desire to make combat feel more physical, more brutal, and more reactive to the player’s actions. We wanted enemies to visibly reflect the damage they’ve taken, rather than simply falling to the floor when dispatched. When we were exploring ways to push the game’s darker tone while also reinforcing combat viscerality, dismemberment felt like a natural extension. We want players to finish encounters, look back and see the limbs of their foes scattered across the landscape.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-more-invasive-umbral-realm"><strong>A More Invasive Umbral Realm</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new Umbral realm has been defined as "more sinister," and that it will "step into you." What does this thematically and mechanically mean for the player? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Thematically, Umbral represents a much more invasive force this time around. It’s not simply a parallel world you observe, it’s something that actively intrudes on the player’s experience, reinforcing the sense that the world itself is hostile.</p>



<p>On the mechanical front, Umbral applies more constant pressure. It reacts more aggressively to player presence, influences combat and exploration more directly, and creates a heightened sense of tension the longer you remain within it. Visually, we’ve also pushed to ensure that Umbral feels distinct from Axiom in every region, with greater variation in mood, structure, and environmental storytelling.</p>



<h3 id="h-addressing-enemy-density-and-world-navigation"><strong>Addressing Enemy Density and World Navigation</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: One major piece of feedback from the original was that high enemy density often felt frustrating rather than challenging. How have you re-evaluated enemy placement and spawn logic? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The feedback around enemy density was taken very seriously. Difficulty should come from intentional encounter design, not from overwhelming the player with sheer numbers or unavoidable ranged pressure. In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em>, enemy placement and spawn logic have been reworked to emphasize clarity, spacing, and purpose. Encounters are designed around specific combat challenges... the result is difficulty that feels demanding but fair, and far less arbitrary.</p>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">: How has world design evolved to address concerns about confusing map layouts and navigation?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> World readability was a key focus for the sequel. Environmental landmarks, improved flow between areas, and more intuitive spatial logic all contribute to a world that still feels dense and mysterious, but far less confusing to navigate. And as a last resort if players are truly lost, we’re bringing back the Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic... which directs players to the next vestige.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lords-of-the-Fallen-2-Player-First-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The shortcomings of the original are being used to make Lords of the Fallen II a better experience right from launch</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-narrative-and-player-progression"><strong>Narrative and Player Progression</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: It has been said that the sequel will feature a "more accessible and character-driven" approach. How are you achieving this without sacrificing the deep lore the genre is known for? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The narrative approach is more mission driven this time, which helps ground the story emotionally and provide clearer motivations for the player. However, we’ve been careful not to sacrifice the genre’s strengths. The aim is clarity without over-explanation, giving players stronger narrative anchors while still rewarding curiosity and interpretation.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The original was criticized for upgrade mechanics that disincentivized experimentation. How does the sequel tackle this? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A</strong>: In the sequel, we’ve taken steps to reduce friction around upgrades and progression so that trying something new feels exciting rather than risky. The goal is to maintain meaningful choices while removing unnecessary barriers.</p>



<h3 id="h-technical-stability-and-post-launch-support"><strong>Technical Stability and Post-Launch Support</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">: Given the stuttering issues with some Unreal Engine 5 titles, what has been implemented to guarantee a smooth day one experience?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Our experience launching one of the earliest UE5 titles gave us valuable insight... these learnings have informed how we approach optimisations in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> from day one of production. We’re also working very closely with our partner, Epic, to proactively design around known constraints.</p>



<p><strong>Q: If you could distill all the learning from the community's feedback into one key principle that defines the development of Lords of the Fallen II, what would it be?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Respect the player’s time. That means clearer systems, stronger onboarding, great performance, and an overall experience that challenges as opposed to frustrates. Everything we’ve built in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> is guided by that idea.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Thank yo</strong><strong>u</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> for your time!</strong></p>

			<p>While opinions may vary on how Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series' signature formula and gameplay, there's no denying that the game's performance on PC and consoles isn't where it should be. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4 is a step in the right direction for sure</strong></a>, but more work is needed besides&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the over 100 performance improvements introduced</strong></a>&nbsp;to finally address what is, sti</span>ll today, one of the game's biggest issues, if not the biggest.</p>



<p>Besides working on improving Monster Hunter Wilds' performance, however, some datamined information suggests that CAPCOM could be working on something else as well: <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game.</strong></p>



<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/"><strong>Monster Hunter Leaks subreddit</strong></a>, some dedicated users took a good look at the aforementioned Title Update 4, discovering some information on the potential arrival of <strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong> and additional content in the future. The most interesting discovery, however, is the addition of some platform information mentioning a <strong>"nsw2UpgradeEdition"</strong>, possibly referencing a Nintendo Switch 2 release for the game.</p>

<p>Considering how Monster Hunter Wilds runs on PC and consoles, the community's reaction didn't disappoint. <span><em>"Game barely runs on PC properly, and they expect it to port to Switch 2?"</em>&nbsp;said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxx67z/comment/nwe8ta9/"><strong>Ayyzeee</strong></a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, echoing what most of the community thinks about this port, which looks more impossible than the solid <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</strong></a> Nintendo Switch 2 ports.</span> </p>



<p><em>"The Steam Deck can barely run this as is, and now we have a SW2 port? </em><span><em>Good luck,"</em>&nbsp;said <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415472">Kindekuma on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, further highlighting how the community doesn't think bringing Monster Hunter Wilds to Nintendo Switch 2 is the b</span>est idea.</p>



<p>Other users didn't miss the chance to joke on what could be expected out of this Nintendo Switch 2 port. <em>"Now at a blistering 480p/20fps"</em>, <em>"Are they going to upscale 160 × 144px to 1080p?"</em> said ResetERA users <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149414158">Mars People</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415184"><strong>Melhadf.</strong></a> <em>"Potato Mode"</em> is also a recurring joke, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149419351"><strong>Dale Copper's image</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how possible is a Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong> As the Nintendo console already proved to be a more than capable system with some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">excellent multiplatform ports</a></strong>, there's no denying that getting the latest entry in the series to run properly on the system can be a challenge. </p>



<p>Currently, the Steam Deck struggles to run the game properly, even with aggressive upscaling, so the game would require significant optimization for the system to achieve a stable 30 FPS. Still, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-impress-rog-ally-x-comparison/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS</strong></a>, this port could be surprisingly good, especially if performance continues to improve on other platforms as well.</p>



<p>Besides performance, which continues to remain a significant issue, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffered from a very low challenge level. This issue, thankfully, was addressed by the game's post-launch updates, <span>to the extent that the game's director, Yuya Takuda, hopes&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/" target="_blank"><strong>lapsed players will return to the game</strong></a>, which, in my opinion,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank"><strong>still deserves to be played</strong></a>, despite</span> its issues.</p>
