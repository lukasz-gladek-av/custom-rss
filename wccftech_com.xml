			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster project mod is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements to the PlayStation 4 exclusive which has become fully playable on PC this year thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator.</p>
<p>The 0.8 version of the mod introduces plenty of improvements over the previous release, such as more point lights, more parallax occlusion mapping, some reflectance map changes, and more. The new features introduced by the new version of the mod are explained in great detail by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, creator of the mod, in the video below. The mod can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

<p>Having a playable PC version of Bloodborne has been a dream for soulslike fans for a very long time, and it has finally become a reality earlier this year, as mentioned above, thanks to the fast improvement of the ShadPS4 emulator over the past few months. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but things continue to improve steadily, and a recent update of the emulator addressed some of the most common issues with the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/">RAM usage spikes, excessive VRAM usage, and frequent crashing</a>. The reduction in VRAM usage is actually a rather significant improvement, as this should allow those with older GPUs to run the game better.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that has made Bloodborne playable on PC can be found on its official website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today has been a day of announcements for Japanese publisher Nihon Falcom, who has revealed an updated version of Ys X as well as the release window and platforms for the previously announced Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, a remake of the first entry in the sprawling Trails series.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the updated version of the tenth entry in the series, which was released only a few months ago in the West. This new version of the game will feature plenty of new features, including a new location, Aland Island, located to the north of Obelia Gulf, where Adol and Karja will meet another mysterious Mana user, learn new Mana Actions, and more. Together with the new story content, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature new bosses, Mana Ride races, and arena battles that will put players' skills to the test. The game has only been announced for Japan as of now and will launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Besides announcing Ys X: Proud Nordics, Falcom revealed today that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which was revealed for Nintendo Switch earlier this year, will also launch on PC and PlayStation 5 during Fall 2025. The game will be published in the West by GungHo Online Entertainment, complete with English and Japanese voice-overs and English, Japanese, French, and German subtitles. A new trailer showcasing the overhauled visuals and combat system over the original was also released today, and you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd9j_NWZGG8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement of more platforms and a release window for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is very welcome, the announcement of Ys X: Proud Nordics so close to the Western release of the original version of the game is far less so, even though it is a completely enjoyable experience, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">review</a>. Hopefully, players won't need to purchase the game again to enjoy the new content, which sounds rather substantial.</p>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 major patch is now live on PC and Xbox consoles, bringing performance and optimization improvements, A-Life 2.0 enhancements, and more.</p>
<p>The massive 1.1 patch, which is a whopping 110 GB big, addresses over 1800 issues, including many of the issues that prevented the game's A-Life system from working properly in Offline, out of the player's visualization range. Plenty of AI "anomalies" were also fixed, and some balance adjustments were made, such as increased rewards for several missions, tweaked damage for PSY fields, and more.</p>
<p>The new STALKER 2 major patch also brings performance and optimization improvements. Largely populated areas of the map should run better in the new version of the game, and performance drops should no longer be an issue in a variety of scenarios and for those running the game on any RTX 3000 series card with AND FSR frame generation. You can check out the massive list of fixes introduced by the new patch by heading over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World, which has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-already-profitable-says-gsc-investor-and-it-might-be-adapted-to-netflix/">become profitable and could be adapted for a TV show</a>, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana (former NPD) Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3ldljjx7lak2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in a BlueSky post that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed PlayStation 2's lifetime console sales in the United States.</p>
<p>It's undoubtedly a huge milestone. To this date, the PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling console of all time, with around 160 million units sold, although that's a global figure. In the United States, the PlayStation 2 has sold 53 million units, which means the Nintendo Switch is now slightly over that number. There's actually another console that sold even more: the Nintendo DS, with its 57 million units. However, the DS was a handheld-only console, whereas the Switch is a hybrid console, making it directly comparable with the PS2.</p>
<p>Globally, the Nintendo Switch is still a bit far from the PS2. Around three months ago, we learned that the hybrid hardware had sold 146 million units, and its sales have been slowing down over the past year or so. With the Switch 2 about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it's unlikely the original will be able to gather enough momentum to push past the PlayStation 2 and sit on the throne of all-time console sales.</p>
<p>Even so, it remains a smashing success for Nintendo, and it wasn't at all a given. Looking at Nintendo's history, they've gone from successful consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which sold 61.91 million and 49.1 million units, respectively) to much less fortunate projects, like the Nintendo 64 (32 million units) and the GameCube (21.74 million consoles). The Wii returned Nintendo to its glory days and broke the milestone of a hundred million consoles sold, partly thanks to the motion control fad. But then the Wii U was another big flop, selling only 13.5 million units, the lowest ever for Nintendo.</p>
<p>It's hard to gauge what will happen with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, although the fact that it's rumored to carry over the same concepts as the Switch makes fans hopeful it will be another success story. Analysts are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish</a> about it, that's for sure.</p>

			<p>Following the rumor that Sony would be interested in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring</a> FromSoftware's parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, the two companies have just <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they have entered a strategic capital and business alliance that will make Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa's stock. It's not the first time, as the companies <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> a similar announcement three years ago, but it sounds like they're getting tighter. Sony is investing roughly $320 million to acquire 12 million new shares of the Japanese multimedia company.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Sony and Kadokawa will collaborate on several projects, such as adapting the latter company's intellectual properties to live-action TV or cinema, co-producing new anime works, and expanding the publishing of Kadokawa's games.</p>
<p>Takeshi Natsuno, Chief Executive Officer of Kadokawa Corporation, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony. This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony’s support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid-to-long term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market.</em></p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, President, COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>
<p><em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em></p>
<p>Non-PlayStation gamers have been wary that this could mean FromSoftware's games would become exclusive to Sony's consoles, but this is doubtful. In all likelihood, the main goal of this collaboration is to adapt Kadokawa's franchises to other media.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prey-remastered-luma-mod-adds-hdr-gtao-dlss-and-improves-a-boatload-of-other-things/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new mod called Prey Remastered Luma that all fans of Arkane Austin's massively underrated game should check out. It was made by Filippo Tarpini, the Remedy developer who already worked on the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-mod-developed-by-remedy-programmer-adds-native-hdr-full-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control HDR/DLSS</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-luma-native-hdr-mod-released-by-all-star-modding-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Luma HDR</a> mods (the latter with the help of a larger team).</p>
<p>Despite the naming, Prey Luma actually has more in common with the former mod. That's basically, it doesn't just HDR; it introduces a lot more, such as support for NVIDIA DLSS and GTAO (Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion), and improves many graphics features such as Screen Space Reflections, Anisotropic Filtering, dynamic shadows, and more. The whole Prey Luma changelog can be found below; the mod can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added HDR output (scRGB 16bit) with (improved tonemappin and rework of all post-processing effects</li>
<li>Increased buffers quality in SDR and HDR, reducing banding</li>
<li>Improved the quality of dynamic shadow, especially from up close</li>
<li>Added a more modern Ambient Occlusion solution (GTAO); the original AO is also improved in quality</li>
<li>Improved Screen Space Reflections</li>
<li>Added DLSS Super Resolution (on Nvidia GPUs) (OptiScaler can be used to inject FSR 3) (this looks drastically better than the native TAA and has no noticeable ghosting)</li>
<li>Added RCAS sharpening after TAA (replacing the original basic sharpening implementation)</li>
<li>Improved all the native Anti Aliasing implementations (e.g., SMAA and TAA)</li>
<li>Improved Anisotropic Filtering (it was not set to 16x on all textures that would benefit from it)</li>
<li>Improved quality and look of sun shaft effects and lens "optic" effects (e.g., lens flare)</li>
<li>Improved Motion Blur quality and fixes multiple issues with its motion vectors</li>
<li>Improved Bloom quality and fixes multiple issues with its generation (e.g., it was trailing at the edge of the screen)</li>
<li>Improved Ultrawide Aspect Ratio support (Bloom, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, etc. did not scale properly with it, causing the sun to be huge in UW or causing bloom and chromatic aberration to be stretched). Prey now also exposes the vertical Field of View instead of the horizontal one, which was limited to 120 and not Ultrawide friendly.</li>
<li>Improved High Resolution support (a multitude of effects did not scale properly to 4K like the object highlight overlay or stars/sun sprites)</li>
<li>Improved Dynamic Resolution Scaling support (Film Grain, Bloom, TAA, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, and many other effects did not scale properly with it)</li>
<li>Improved High Frame Rate support by unlocking the frame rate beyond 144 (you can change the limit in the menu now)</li>
<li>Improved Swapchain flip model (more responsive for VRR)</li>
<li>Added optional HDR post-process filter on pre-rendered videos</li>
<li>Added settings to turn off Vignette or Camera Motion Blur</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Prey PC's Upgrade: HDR Support, Improved Graphics, DLSS and more!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15c1SKWD0cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, with Arkane Austin gone, the likelihood of a new Prey game in that vein seems very low. However, thanks to this mod, PC players will be able to continue playing this game with enhanced visuals.</p>
