			<p>As showcased in the State of Play yesterday, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has an official release date of August 28, 2025. This title will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. For those in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) you are already able to pre-order this title on your chosen platform, with some differences in the editions that are available.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to be a faithful remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, an iconic game that was originally released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. However, with a new generation being introduced to Solid Snake, as well as loyal fans wanting more Metal Gear Solid action, a remake was the perfect way to introduce newcomers to the franchise. The remake will star the original English and Japanese voice actors, with a rich and intense storyline and some<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"> new expansive features</a> of the combat system with brand-new graphics and immersive sound.</p>
<p>If you are yet to see the trailer, here is what you missed from last night's State of Play.</p>

This is due to the return of Snake vs. Monkey, which is a fan-favorite game that will be making a return on PlayStation and Steam at launch, with more information to come about Snake vs. Monkey for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game later down the line.</p>
<p>If you know that you plan on getting this game, pre-orders are already open in EMEA, as stated above. There are multiple editions available, with some of the editions providing you with DLC that can give you some extra cosmetics to play with.</p>

<p>Metal Eden is a sci-fi FPS title where you get to explore a world where humanity's consciousness is no longer being held in captivity in the flesh and now resides within robots. There will be eight missions for you to make your way through, with a handcrafted universe to explore. This game will see you plunged into an artificial world full of cybernetic warfare, where you'll be given the opportunity to take control of a hyper unit while also exploring the world and uncovering the mysteries of the futuristic world before you.</p>
<p>In Metal Eden, you take on the role of ASKA, which is an advanced Hyper Unit android that has been built around a digitized human psyche. The architecture in the world around you is bathed in neon lights, helping to immerse you into the cyber-futuristic world in front of you, which has been named Moebius.

<p>On this journey, you are accompanied by your sentient spaceship named Nexus. As you progress through the story, you will expand and upgrade your arsenal, as well as make your robotic body even stronger and more robust to be able to continue fighting off enemies in a mechanical world.

			<p>After several months of quiet, developer Build a Rocket Boy shared a new gameplay trailer for MindsEye, their story-driven action/adventure thriller game, during yesterday's State of Play broadcast. They also revealed that the game will be released this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by IO Interactive</a>.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer on GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA IV, and GTA V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I’ve dedicated my entire career to crafting captivating interactive entertainment to delight players. With MindsEye, we’ve pushed cinematic adventure to the next level - building characters and a world that feels truly alive. We can’t wait for players to step in and feel the immersive realism and tireless effort poured into every moment of the game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Official Gameplay Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSn42TbRngY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye is developed with the same technology that powers <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, the studio's ambitious user generated content (UGC) platform. In this game, players will become Jacob Diaz, who has received a mysterious neural implant (the titular MindsEye) which has left him with disjointed flashbacks of his time in the service.</p>
<p>Set in Redrock, a fictional desert metropolis in the not-too-distant future, MindsEye tells a story of artificial intelligence, human greed, and the struggle for control that has brought the Earth to the brink of collapse. Players will explore a richly detailed world, uncovering hidden conspiracies while navigating a deeply personal and high-stakes narrative.</p>
<p>MindsEye delivers intense combat where every decision is critical to survival. Players will engage in third-person shooter encounters, facing enemies that coordinate attacks, flush them from cover, and swarm with overwhelming force. Success depends on quick thinking, tactical positioning, and using the environment and a companion drone to gain the upper hand. There are also 'thrilling' high-speed chases that will push the player's driving skills to the limit, taking Jacob through a variety of environments, such as bustling cityscapes, remote industrial sites, trailer parks, and deserts. You can now wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
