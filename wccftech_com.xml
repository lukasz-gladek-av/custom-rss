			<p>We already knew that Battlefield 6 was shaping up to be a big success <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on the player concurrency peaks reached on Steam</a>. However, the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-is-a-smash-hit-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=176159450&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Alinea Analytics newsletter</a> paints a much clearer picture that also includes data from the other platforms.</p>



<p>According to the analyst firm, Battlefield 6 has already sold more than six and a half million units across PC and consoles, thus generating over $350 million in revenue and approaching Call of Duty-levels of sales, which is what Electronic Arts has been seeking all along.</p>



<p>The vast majority of players (56.7%) purchased the game through Valve's Steam platform, where Battlefield 6 sold over three and a half million units and generated more than $220 million in revenue. As for the consoles, the PlayStation 5 userbase (23.7%) only narrowly beats that of the Xbox Series S|X (19.6%), which is surprising on one hand because there are many more PlayStation 5 consoles out there. On the other hand, Xbox fans were quite literally raised on shooters, so it's understandable they would flock in droves to the new hot shooter, whereas PlayStation users have always been more diverse when it comes to the games they play.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alinea Analytics also reckons that, at least so far, the game is managing to keep the interest of those who bought it. The analyst firm remarks how Battlefield 6 is exhibiting an 'extraordinarily flat' daily active users curve, meaning there is practically no drop-off of existing users, while new users are still coming in daily.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, those who bought the game on Steam regularly played other shooters like Call of Duty, Helldivers 2, The Finals, Marvel Rivals, Ready or Not, and, of course, previous Battlefield games. Regarding the regional distribution, a third of Steam's Battlefield 6 players are from the United States, but there's also a 15% from China. The 3% from Japan is also a further sign that Japanese players also like shooters and PC games nowadays.</p>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of what Electronic Arts hopes will be a long and successful live service. Already, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-battlefield-6-tweaks-rolled-out-without-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have started applying the first balancing tweaks</a>. Season 1, which will add new maps, modes, weapons, and more, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is due to begin on October 28</a>. Then there's the Battle Royale mode, which is currently being tested<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in the Battlefield Labs program</a>. Needless to say, if this mode also turned out to be popular, EA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty goals of reaching 100 million players</a> could suddenly become more than a pipe dream.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Rumored to Get Full Remake Treatment with Sprinting]]></title>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1977781382563745995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker Halo Leaks</a>, the rumored new Halo: Combat Evolved edition is getting the full remake treatment, similar to CAPCOM's latest Resident Evil games. This includes the ability for the main character, Master Chief, to sprint (which was, of course, absent in the original game) and modern gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p><em>I can definitely confirm the Halo: Combat Evolved Remake will have sprint &amp; "modern gameplay mechanics". I'm of the belief its gameplay will be similar to the new Halo Multiplayer game, which I also believe is Halo 7's MP. It's a full remake similar to the Resident Evil remakes.</em></p>



<p>This would inevitably change how the game plays compared to the 2001 game, which was initially launched on the first Xbox. Then again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-now-available-on-pc-as-part-of-mcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's already the Anniversary edition</a> for those who would prefer sticking with that.</p>



<p>Earlier rumors suggest the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2026</a> and only feature the single player campaign, ditching the multiplayer modes. The 2026 date tracks, as Microsoft previously mentioned that they wanted to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Xbox with its core franchises, including Gears of War: E-Day, the Fable reboot, the new Forza Horizon game, and of course, Halo itself.</p>



<p>Other recent rumors have <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed to Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos studio, helping Halo Studios with the development. The Halo: Combat Evolved remake will allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use a combination of Unreal Engine 5 and the original Blam engine</a>, just like Oblivion Remastered (also co-developed by Virtuos), which mixed UE5 and the Creation engine. </p>



<p>The developers had previously teased fans that more information on their next project would be revealed during the Halo World Championship (HWC) 2025, which will take place from October 24 to 26, in Seattle, Washington, at the Seattle Convention Center. In around ten days we'll know whether the Halo: Combat Evolved remake rumors were correct, although everything points in that direction, for sure.</p>
