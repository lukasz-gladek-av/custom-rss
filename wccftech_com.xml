			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake/remaster</a> will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-gets-3-0-beta-update-reducing-artifacts-and-improving-latency/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The software Lossless Scaling has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/527583114757669394?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major update from developer THS. The Frame Generation component that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> exactly one year ago has been upgraded to version 3.0 (beta), introducing what the developer has described as major improvements across the board in quality, latency, and performance.</p>
<p>Flickering and border artifacts have been reduced, benefiting motion clarity and smoothness alike. GPU load has also shrunk by a sizable 40% compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-universal-frame-generation-2-0-out-now-improves-efficiency-noticeably-reduces-artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSFG 2</a> x2 in non-Performance Mode, while multipliers above x2 have had their GPU load reduced by over 45% compared to the previous version of the software. Perhaps the most welcome enhancements are those in the latency area. According to the developer's latency test, Lossless Scaling Frame Generation 3.0 has 24% lower latency than 2.0.</p>

<p>There's more. This new release unlocks frame rate generation multipliers up to x20. However, the developer shared some recommendations to get optimal results:</p>
<p><em>Base frame rate: A minimum of 30 FPS is required (40 FPS or higher is preferred, with 60 FPS being ideal) at 1080p. </em><em>For best overall experience, locking the game frame rate is recommended. This helps to avoid 100% GPU load (reducing its impact on latency) and ensures smoother frame pacing.</em></p>
<p><em>For higher resolution, use at higher than recommended frame rates or use the "Resolution Scale" option to downscale input to 1080p:</em><br>
<em>For 1440p, set it to 75%.</em><br>
<em>For 4K, set it to 50%.</em></p>
<p><em>Higher multipliers (e.g., X5 or above) are best suited for high refresh rate setups, such as:</em></p>
<p><em>48 FPS × X5 for 240Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X6 for 360Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X8 for 480Hz.</em></p>
<p>While new and recent PC games support natively integrated frame generation (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-frame generation</a>) technologies from NVIDIA and/or AMD, older games can still benefit from this tool, especially when heavily modded.</p>

<p>THS also announced that an opt-in Lossless Scaling User Interface 3.0 beta can now be selected by going into your Steam library, right-clicking on the software, selecting properties and then beta from the Betas tab. Last but not least, Windows 11 24H2 users can once again select the DXGI Capture API thanks to Microsoft's recent KB5046617 update.</p>
