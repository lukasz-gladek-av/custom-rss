			<p>Sony Santa Monica has been working on *something* following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and co-creator of the God of War series and lead on the 2018 reboot of the series, Cory Barlog, has been leading a new project at the studio for some time. But we're still very short on any details regarding what's next for the studio.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been pretty mute on the subject of Sony Santa Monica's new game, but we do seem to have a small update on how things are going. In a thread on ResetEra, Bloomberg reporter and video game industry insider Jason Schreier responded to a question regarding SSM's next game and Cory Barlog's new project. </p>



<p>"<em>Cory Barlog's game is SSM's next big thing</em>," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-394#post-142651128">Schreier responded</a>. "<em>Last time I spoke to anyone about it (a month or two ago) it was going well.</em>" That doesn't tell us very much at all, but at least its a sign that things are in a good place at Sony Santa Monica regarding Barlog and his team's new game.</p>



<p>Schreier's next comment, however, is what made players raise their eyebrows as to whatever this next game is. The prevailing rumor about SSM's next big game <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/">has been that it is a brand new IP</a>, a big deal for a studio that has only made God of War games for its entire existence. After his comments on how things are going started to make the rounds on social media, and players expressed their excitement for a new IP from SSM,<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-396#post-142655865"> Schreier followed up by asking</a>, "<em>Why does everybody think Barlog's game is a new IP?</em>"</p>



<p>Just asking the question doesn't insinuate one way or the other about Sony Santa Monica's next game being a new IP. But it does leave some doubt regarding previous rumors about Barlog's next project being the studio's first deviation from the God of War series. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see what Sony Santa Monica and Barlog's team has been cooking, though who knows when PlayStation will be ready to talk about it. </p>



<p>The other major rumor circulating the God of War studio is that there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War</a> game coming. That project, supposedly, could be announced any day now, as it was claimed earlier this year that it was due to be revealed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>July 2025 kicked off with devastating news for Microsoft employees, as it laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 workers across the entire company,</a> with a significant number of those layoffs hitting Xbox and Microsoft's gaming division. <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">game projects</a> were shut down, veteran developers were either laid off or<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"> left</a> because of the cuts, and amid reports that the layoffs are directly related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft wanting to invest more in its AI efforts</a>, Microsoft and Xbox executives have failed to read the room multiple times.</p>



<p>While claims were circulating that Microsoft and Xbox are<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> "<em>trying their damndest to replace jobs with AI agents</em>,"</a> it was unfortunate, to say the least, that a seemingly automated invite went out to developers inviting them to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">how AI tools can aid in game development</a>. Disdain towards Xbox, Microsoft, and the c-suite executives who didn't lose their jobs compounded when an executive producer at Xbox suggested that <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt">laid-off workers confide in ChatGPT to help them cope with being laid off</a>.</p>



<p>At least executive producer Matt Turnbull's ill-advised LinkedIn post was, at least on the surface, an attempt to help laid-off workers. Principal development lead for Xbox Graphics, Mike Matsel's post, however, is somehow even more tone-deaf and bull-headed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmatsel_the-xbox-graphics-team-is-hiring-folks-with-activity-7349539853866344449-O1G3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Matsel put out a call</a> that the Xbox Graphics team was hiring two roles. He specified that the team is looking for people "<em>with experience with device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience</em>." He then links the two job postings, and tells people to message him directly if the postings on Microsoft's website claim to be closed. </p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and even though putting out a hiring call a little more than a week after mass layoffs is never a good look, it's unfortunately a common occurrence. What cinches Matsel's post as tone-deaf, is that he shares an AI-generated image along with his post, which shows someone working at a desktop, presumably looking at nothing, since the image shows their screen on the backside of the monitor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The comments are, unsurprisingly, filled with people digging into Matsel for posting the image, with one person saying "<em>You could have just sketched an ad on paint, at least it would have been funny. This is just embarrassing.</em>" Another, seemingly referencing Matsel's lack of care in his post, wrote, "<em>I too can post AI slop. Put me on the team, coach!</em>"</p>



<p>You have to wonder whether Turnbull and Matsel made their posts earnestly, or if they were baiting the uproar that both posts have caused. Neither is a good look, because if they earnestly made these posts, then that shows a huge inability to read a room, and a lack of understanding as to how they should communicate with others, whether that's trying to communicate a message of empathy, or opportunity. </p>



<p>If they were baiting the reactions, it's surprising and disappointing to see two high-level executives seeking enjoyment out of a situation that has devastated hundreds of their former coworkers and each of their families. </p>
