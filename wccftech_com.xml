			<p>What's surprising about <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't that it's a popular game that sold well; <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">there was a lot of hype leading up to its launch</a>, and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> already <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">had a lot of great feedback from the beta tests it ran</a>. Its staying power and continued upward momentum are what's surprising, as no one could have predicted it would continue to be one of the most-played games on Steam each and every day since it arrived. </p>



<p>Now, according to Alinea Analytics, Embark Studio's third-person extraction shooter has reached a new milestone, with over <strong>12 million copies sold</strong>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">says analyst Rhys Elliot</a>. "<em>So ARC Raiders passed 12M copies sold over the weekend (Alinea estimates)</em>," Elliot wrote in a post on Bluesky.</p>



<p>Not only has it hit yet another sales milestone, but it also set a new record for its daily active users, with over 3.2 million players tuning in yesterday, January 4, to spend their final hours of the winter/holiday break playing some ARC Raiders.</p>







<p>When ARC Raiders launched in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">it was immediately Embark Studios' biggest game</a>, reaching over 200K concurrent players on Steam and who knows how many more on consoles. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">hit 2.5 million copies in its debut week</a>, and barely a week later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">it had surpassed 4 million copies sold</a>. Yes, there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">fair bit of controversy around Embark Studios' use of GenAI</a>, but that never seemed to slow down the game's sales or the fact that it was dominating the conversation around multiplayer games heading into the end of the year and awards season.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most searched video game of the year according to Google</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of Steam's best-selling games by revenue in 2025</a>. Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">continued use and promotion of GenAI</a> still follows the game whenever it comes up in conversation, but it's clearly not a hindrance to it, as at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1m">there are over 240K concurrent players in the game on Steam right now</a>. </p>



<p>It hasn't even dropped below 250K concurrent players since launch, according to SteamDB. Its staying power has been impressive, to say the least, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the defining game of 2026 was this third-person extraction shooter from October 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-is-weird-and-fcked-up-why-one-modder-is-pushing-artistic-flair-against-realism-and-boring-ray-tracing-trends/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With the improvements made to the <strong>ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</strong> in the past year, playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on PC has become a reality even without an official port. The emulation improvements also paved the way for mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/"><strong>unlock the game's framerate past the 30 FPS cap</strong></a> of the vanilla release and introduced <strong>visual enhancements</strong>.</p>



<p>Among the visual overhauls released for the now-classic PS4 action role-playing game is the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fromsoftserve</a></strong>, a known Souls series modder. Over the past few days, the project became <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong>, undergoing some massive changes fueled by the modder's desire to push <strong>"artistic flair"</strong> against realistic visuals and <strong>"boring" ray tracing trends</strong> that are dominating the industry of late.</p>



<p>The launch of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod, now available from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a></strong>, was announced in a new video shared by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fromsoftserve</strong> on YouTube, which goes over its features. The most notable are the inclusion of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dynamic shadows</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">parallax occlusion mapping</strong> to many surfaces, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">point lights</strong> for elements that emit no light in the vanilla version, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">higher resolution skyboxes,</strong> and more.</p>



<p>Possibly more interesting, however, is the inclusion of <strong>alternate color grading</strong>, which gives <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> a rather peculiar feel. Although quite different from the vanilla grading, <strong>fromsoftserve</strong> believes it suits the game well: <em>"Bloodborne is cosmic and weird and f*cked up, and you can have a very weird looking game,"</em> the modder said in the video.</p>



<p><em>"I'm actually far more interested in an image being interesting than realistic. I think the industry is way too focused on realism, and they’re forgetting that we’re playing games. I think that’s more interesting and has more 'soul' to it than just trying to make it look like a photograph,"</em> fromsoftserve continued in the video to highlight how their approach has a more <strong>artistic flair</strong> that is in stark contrast to the <strong>almost obnoxious search for realism</strong> that is dominating video games as of late.</p>



<p><strong>Ray Tracing</strong> and <strong>Path Tracing</strong> are two other trends that have dominated the video game industry in recent months, and the new approach in the <strong><em>Bloodborne Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod is also a pushback against how ray-traced features are being used.</p>



<p><em>"I love ray tracing and path tracing, but I think the industry is using it currently in a somewhat boring method where they’re just trying to make it look realistic. Making lighting unrealistic is also awesome and fun."</em> Seeing the visuals most of the industry, especially Western developers, is pushing nowadays that is making it difficult to distinguish one game from another, it's difficult not to agree with <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides any further improvements <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod may bring in the next few months, <strong>2026</strong> is still setting out to be an exciting year for <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> fans, even without an official remaster on the horizon. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/">The </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>ShadPS4 team is currently exploring the possibility of enabling the game's online multiplayer features on PC</strong></a>, which will truly transform the emulated version into the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game once they become available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It’s December 2025 in Los Angeles. Players are furiously posting on ResetERA or Reddit about what bonkers predictions will show up at The Game Awards: will Phantom Blade 0 get a release date, will Geoff bring up a Muppet or Kojima onto the stage first, and what the hell is that monolith in the Mojave Desert all about? Before any of that took place, Wccftech was invited out along with a core group of fellow Soulslike-experienced journalists and content creators to visit Bandai Namco for an all-day preview event, going hands-on with Code Vein II for the very first time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Character-Creation.png"></a></figure>



<p>Despite the obvious sequel numbering in its moniker, Bandai Namco Studios and Shift reiterated multiple times that this is intended to be its own standalone story from the first game, and no prior experience from the original game is required. Of course, with Code Vein II set to launch at the end of January, that’s plenty of time to dive into the original game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC.</p>



<p>In the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/678960/CODE_VEIN">Code Vein</a>, players assumed the role of a Revenant, an artificially-made vampire who requires some form of blood to sustain and maintain any sort of bloodthirst and cravings (Blood Beads being the most common way to satisfy those cravings without needing to seek out a human donor. Those same Revenants are being transformed into Horrors in the numbered sequel, necessitating the player in this new title to become a Revenant Hunter instead.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Visit-the-Past.png"></a></figure>



<p>The core theme to Code Vein II is a future that’s not set in stone. While the first game was about continuing on a linear path and the occasional dive into the player’s memories to view events in the past, Code Vein II is largely about changing the past to affect the present. The story opens with a cutscene telling the tale of a great Upheaval and four heroes that sacrificed themselves to seal away calamity through something called the Luna Rapacis. In order to enact great change in a world that’s already on the brink of further extinction, the hands-on session focused on venturing into the past to destroy one of these seals.</p>



<p>Despite the role reversal between the hunter and the hunted, many core themes that gave Code Vein a unique sense of combat are present here in <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Code Vein II</a>. Players still don’t have to venture into the dungeons of the world alone and are instead accompanied by an NPC to complement a player’s chosen gameplay style. Of course, there is the ability to absorb that NPC into yourself for several statistical buffs, but even against the bosses of Code Vein II, I found having that extra body helped, especially when it comes to keeping the enemy distracted while I charged up a hefty hammer swing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Slash.png"></a></figure>



<p>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans.</p>



<p>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Levelup.png"></a></figure>



<p>Leveling up has been simplified for the player's view in Code Vein II. Each level-up gives players a modest boost of HP, Stamina, and Attack, with the majority of other stats coming by way of the equipped Blood Code and boosters. This is where the real versatility in character builds comes into pla,y and tracking down a specific Blood Code will be necessary to optimize the player’s build depending on their chosen weapon type and form of engagement. It’s these Blood Codes that give players six different stats (Strength, Dexterity, Mind, Willpower, Vitality, and Fortitude), with equipped gear requiring enough of a particular stat to be wielded effectively without placing a Burden upon the player if they go over one of these thresholds. Take Strength for example; if your gear is too heavy or you picked a massive hammer to go with a more nimble Blood Code, the burden placed on the character is twofold: your attacks will deal more damage, but you’ll also consume more stamina for these attacks if you swing and miss the target completely.</p>



<p>Heft is something that I found the original Code Vein was lacking, as with Shift Inc.’s earlier works with the God Eater franchise. In those games, it didn’t matter how massive a metal tool your character was wielding: the visual impact and weight to strikes felt next to nothing, and the enemy reactions never quite matched up with what one would expect from being struck by a forty-kilogram chunk of solid iron. In this numbered sequel, I felt proud to be picking up a hammer and knocking the ever-living daylights of whatever stood in my way. Charged attacks both feel and deal the amount of damage one would expect, compared to a much lighter and more nimble single-handed weapon.</p>

<p>While Code Vein II does away with the traditional multiplayer (meaning no summoning players to join in if you’re stuck on a particular encounter), the Partner system from the first game has been brought back, giving players a better fighting chance. Much like the first game, these fellow Hunters will complement the player’s given style, providing unique active/passive boons depending on who you pick to accompany you. There is also a system to “absorb” the Partner, forcing the player to venture off solo but with an additional set of unique boons. Partners also serve as a sort of second life for the player. Take enough damage and go down, and your Partner will automatically get you back on your feet, albeit at the cost of some of their own life and a recharge timer. Die a second time before your Partner has a chance to recover, and you’re dead for good, dropping your collected Haze on the ground and respawning at the last checkpoint.</p>



<p>I can’t speak definitively to the level design in Code Vein II quite yet, but I was a fan of the first game’s looping paths and recursive design, where shortcuts found often cut down on large chunks of time spent navigating through decrepit or horrific dungeons. There was the occasional branching path and secret stash of loot, so the exploration spirit in me will be eager to see just what secrets lie in the past to uncover.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Demo-Announcement.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Code Vein II launches on January 30th, 2026, but players eager to step into the shoes of a Revenant Hunter or invest hours in the character creator will have their chance to rewrite history with a public demo launching on January 23rd.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Code Vein II was previewed on the PlayStation 5 Pro. Travel and accommodations was provided by Bandai Namco for this preview event.]</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Styx: Blades of Greed Won’t Be For Everyone, But That’s Okay – Hands-On Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, the Styx series has become the series for those looking for involving stealth gameplay. Cyanide's hardcore approach to stealth mechanics prevented the series from being popular among audiences that weren't the stealth games fanatics, but it's undeniable that this approach, combined with a dark fantasy setting and a chatty, irreverent main character, made the series what it is.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/"><strong>After having had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed</strong></a>, the next entry in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-delayed-out-of-2025-now-set-to-arrive-in-february-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now set to launch this February on PC and consoles</strong></a>, I couldn't help but notice how Cyanide wasn't going to compromise on its hardcore approach to widen the series' appeal. The contrary, actually. </p>



<p>While Styx continues to be the likeable goblin rogue he has always been, everything else has been expanded considerably, with an open-world setting with sandbox features that provides new challenges, but also new tools to dispose of surprisingly attentive enemies that leave no stone unturned if they believe to have spotted something suspicious. This early build was unsurprisingly a little rough around the edges, but the experience's potential was evident.</p>



<p>Last month, I was given a second chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed before its release. While in terms of content this new build wasn't different from the one I tried during Gamescom 2025, except for a new intro sequence teaching the game's basics while setting up the story, the prior experience (and the more relaxed testing environment) made me appreciate even more the focus on verticality, and the sandbox design of the Slums, where the build's main mission takes place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-January-Hands-On-Gameplay.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As part of this build's main mission, Styx is supposed to talk with a drunken dwarf who is staying at a nearby tavern to recover the Zeppelin. With little knowledge of the game mechanics, in my Gamescom 202 test, I went through the tavern's main door, using every opportunity to distract enemies to make it to the dwarf's room, with some difficulty, as the enemies have solid AI that makes them smarter than your usual enemy in non-stealth-focused games. However, now knowing where the room is, I took a completely different approach. </p>



<p>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</p>



<p>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</p>



<p>Besides being able to appreciate better what Styx: Blades of Greed tries to do, the new build also showcased a higher degree of polish over the Gamescom 2025 demo, with little to no visual and gameplay glitches. Unfortunately, I can't really evaluate the game's performance, as the preview was conducted via cloud streaming; however, things felt smooth enough, even with multiple characters on screen.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options. </p>



<p>As such, I am looking forward to seeing what the game will offer beyond what I have already experienced twice, and whether the map and encounter design will hold up as well as they do in these missions when it launches on February 19 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
