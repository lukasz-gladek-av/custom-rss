			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC</a> alleges that Square Enix is laying off staff in "<em>nearly all areas</em>" of its Western offices, with staff in its Europe and US offices hit. There's currently no word from Square Enix on how many have been impacted by this layoff, but sources told VGC that just from Square's London office, 140 employees are at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>The news was delivered to staff through an internal video call as part of a restructuring that Square had mentioned <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in the progress report it published today</a>, the same report where it boldly claimed that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/">wanted 70% of its QA work to be done by AI by 2027</a>.</p>



<p>In the progress report, Square writes, "<em>a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency</em>."</p>



<p>This aligns with VGC's report, which includes the same wording from Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu, who also added that this layoff is intended to make Square more "<em>lean</em>" and <em>"agile</em>." The cuts will save Square 3 billion yen annually, according to the company's projections.</p>



<p>Along with the cost savings, the cuts are meant to bring work that developers are doing at Square Enix closer to home, so to speak. In the progress report, Square says the decision came by intending "<em>To strengthen development capabilities from a Group-wide perspective and to optimize resource allocation for maximizing the value generated by IPs, a further review of the development pipeline was conducted. As a result, a decision was made to close overseas development studios and shift toward consolidating development functions in Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>Square is not the only Asia-based developer moving away from branching studios in other parts of the world. Shortly after a successful launch for Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">NetEase cut its California-based team</a> as part a restructuring to keep work on the game closer to its home studio. NetEase also shut down two of its subsidiaries, one yesterday, and one today, as part of its continuing restructuring to limit the number of branching studios it has in the Western world.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/">Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down with the loss of NetEase's support</a>, and today, NetEase closed Toronto-based studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-closed-yet-another-game-studio-funded-just-two-years-ago/">Bad Brain Game Studios</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/">Relic Entertainment</a> has announced that a new DLC for Company of Heroes 3 is set to arrive later this month on November 27, 2025. The Company of Heroes 3: Endure and Defy Battlegroup DLC expansion will add four new battlegroups, each with its own play styles, new powerful units, and more when it arrives on PC later this month.</p>



<p>Each of the new battlegroups has been designed for both multiplayer and co-op/skirmish AI modes, with US Forces getting the Italian Partisan Battlegroup, the Wehrmacht getting the Last Stand Battlegroup, the British Forces getting the Polish Cavalry Battlegroup, and the Deutsches Afrikakorps getting the Kriegsmarine Battlegroup.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Company of Heroes 3 - Endure &amp; Defy Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The teaser trailer shows a bit of the new battle groups in action, though Relic Entertainment said in a press release that it will be putting out more information about the coming expansion as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>The Italian Partisan battlegroup is a class of resistance fighters and saboteurs to help enhance your ground forces in battle. They can sabotage your enemy with tunnel networks to plant underground explosives, steal resources, and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The Last Stand Battlegroup is all about defending the line with new vehicles to bolster your defences, while the Polish Calvary battlegroup add strong lancer sections to the front line. They especially thrive against veteran enemies.</p>



<p>When the DLC arrives, it'll be available at a 10% launch discount for its first two weeks. For those who've not yet even jumped into the base game for Company of Heroes 3, it'll be 60% off for a limited time as part of a Black Friday sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's not often that a developer comes out to publicly criticize another's work, and yet that is precisely what Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Game Director Daniel Vávra did yesterday <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1985848222707765440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via his X account</a>. The game he targeted was Obsidian's latest roleplaying game, The Outer Worlds 2, which he scored 7 out of 10. Arguably, the most scathing bit was that, even with 'Microsoft's money' (<a href="https://wccftech.com/inxile-entertainment-acquired-microsoft/">Obsidian was acquired in November 2018 by Microsoft</a>, alongside inXile), they haven't managed to innovate in the last fifteen years following the release of Fallout: New Vegas, which Vávra ranks among his favorite games.</p>



<p>Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Finished. 7/10. But what I find sad is that the company and the people who gave us one of my favorite games ever (Fallout: New Vegas) have been unable, even after 15 years and with all of Microsoft's money and latest technological advances, to come up with a single new game mechanic that could take this proven but ancient formula somewhere new. Can any of you think of a single new game mechanic in The Outer Worlds that wasn't already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago? Unfortunately, I can't. Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens, and level grinding in a static, scripted world.</em></p>



<p>When a follower pointed out that even Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't really add any new mechanics, Vávra protested that it does feature the simulation of thousands of NPCs and their daily routines. </p>



<p>It is indeed true that KCD2 is a much more detailed simulation than The Outer Worlds 2. The latter does inflict bounties when you're caught stealing stuff, but the NPCs do not have true routines, and they do not really object much to your character being inside their homes, just as an example.</p>



<p>While I do generally prefer a simulated world, it's not really an innovative feature, either. Bethesda has had it in their games since The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), at the very least. All that is to say that this is hardly an innovative badge Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 can grab for itself.</p>



<p>As for The Outer Worlds 2, I've also recently completed the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">I had my fair share of criticism to levy at the first one</a>, but I much agree <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our reviewer David Carcasole</a> that the sequel exhibits many improvements. Although there may not be brand-new RPG mechanics, the developers certainly pushed for a lot more player choice in various ways, thus subtly boosting its roleplaying potential (and even the replayability factor). </p>



<p>Besides, it's not exactly easy to innovate at this point in videogames. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 managed it with its turn-based combat mixed with real-time elements, but did Baldur's Gate 3 truly bring new mechanics, or was it just an incredible execution and never-before-seen presentation for a gargantuan cRPG? I rather lean toward the latter. </p>



<p>There's also the fact that badmouthing a fellow developer like that isn't likely to win a lot of fans. Regardless, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great roleplaying game</a>, and it's getting its final DLC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a>, next Tuesday. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for free this weekend</a> on PC and Xbox, for those who are still on the fence about it.</p>

			<p>Research and analysis firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">Alinea Analytics reports</a> that ARC Raiders, the new third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has reached 2.5 million copies sold across all platforms in its debut week, with the vast majority of those sales coming from PC players.</p>



<p>According to Alinea Analytics, across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, 69% of ARC Raiders sales came from PC players on Steam, with 17.3% coming from PlayStation players and the remaining 13% coming from Xbox players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was already clear that ARC Raiders was having a strong commercial start <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">when it surpassed 200K concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a> (and eventually hit over 260K). As its debut week came to a close, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimates-range-1-6-1-9-million-units-on-steam/">analysts predicted it had sold somewhere between 1.6 and 1.9 million copies</a>.</p>



<p>The real number is, thankfully for Embark Studios, even higher than those predictions, as the studio also collects well over $100 million in revenue from the game being on the market for one week. It's handily a bigger launch than Embark Studio's other major multiplayer game, The Finals, and could very well outlast it partly because of its different approach as a premium release and not a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Of course, the new extraction shooter still has a long way to go. It passed the first hurdle for a multiplayer game by having a great launch, and now the real test becomes its capacity for longevity. Right now, ARC Raiders has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">yet to fall below 90K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and even its dip below 100K was only for a very short period of time.</p>



<p>If we're still seeing numbers like that from ARC Raiders in a year, then we'll have a much better sample size for how successful this game can really be. Speaking of what's to come for ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">put out a roadmap for the game's updates for the rest of the year, which you can check out here</a>.</p>
