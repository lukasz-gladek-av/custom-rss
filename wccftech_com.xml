			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lies-of-p-day-z-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus subscribers from the entry-level Essential tier and up will be able to redeem, with Round 8's Lies of P as the headline game for August, and the only game with a native PS5 version available. </p>



<p>The other two games players will be able to redeem are the hardcore zombie survival game DayZ and the 3D arena fighting game My Hero One's Justice 2. All three titles will be available for players to redeem on August 5, 2025, which means that the last chance you'll have to redeem Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">three games for July,</a> is August 4, 2025.</p>

<p>Lies of P entering the service next week is perfect timing for players who've perhaps been looking at Round 8's excellent take on action-RPG games with a more lustful eye since the release of its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Lies of P</a> at launch in 2023, he called it "<em>a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation.</em>" When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">reviewed the Overture DLC</a> earlier this year, he called it "<em>an expansion in the true sense of the word,"</em> and "<em>a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more.</em>"</p>



<p>Now you can get the base game for no extra cost beyond your existing PS Plus subscription, and pick up the DLC for a fraction of the cost of the original game. All together, not a bad deal for Bloodborne and FromSoftware fans who've not yet checked out Lies of P.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4 will have plenty of new features, but it will also respect its predecessor's legacy without necessarily trying to outdo it, as video games aren't mathematical, and acclaim is subjective.</p>



<p>Speaking with GamesRadar+, the game's narrative director Philipp Weber commented on online discussions centered on how CDPR will top the third entry in the series, saying that it is one of his concerns as well. However, the developer was able to move away from them by acknowledging that video games aren't mathematical, acclaim is subjective, and attempting to top The Witcher 3 "mathematically" isn't really an option.</p>



<p>On the contrary, CDPR isn't developing The Witcher 4 with the idea that it has to beat its predecessor in some way. The studio wants to do justice to the legacy of the third entry in the series, and to do so, they are developing the new game using the same philosophies. At the same time, the development team wants to make the game feel like a proper sequel that doesn't retread old ground, so ultimately, The Witcher 4 will feature a <em>"healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," according to Weber. </em>Ultimately, CDPR is developing the game to make sure some people will love it, and hopefully those who love The Witcher 3 also will.</p>



<p>Although The Witcher 4 is not being developed with the idea that it has to surpass The Witcher 3, there's no doubt that the next entry in the series is likely going to surpass its predecessor in terms of visuals, judging from the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> set in the village of Valdrest, which featured impressive NPC density. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a> and the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/">take advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3, the fourth entry in the series promises to be a spectacle for the eyes, no matter the platform.</p>
