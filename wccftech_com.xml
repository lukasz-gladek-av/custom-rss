			<p>It's not been a secret that the games market has been struggling for a while now, with there being constant layoffs and studio closures all across the globe, whether it be from people not playing the games, not wanting them, or just simply being unable to afford them. It's becoming increasingly common that games are getting more expensive, meaning people may not be able to find the money to purchase them, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. Despite these factors, it's been said that the games market will grow by 4.6% in one with inflation. This information comes from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiDiA Research</a>'s Global Games Forecasts.</p>
<p>One of the key points that is mentioned is that the games market is mature, so it is highly unlikely that it will ever experience double-digit growth, and instead, the industry will only see slight growth during this period. It's also estimated that software revenues will continue to grow thanks to massive premium releases coming out this year. This includes Grand Theft Auto 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, and the games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 when that inevitably releases.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there are a ton of live-service games, with major developers deciding to try their luck with live-service games and not having the expected outcome. This has happened with multiple titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a>. However, it's predicted that instead of developing live-service games, developers will go back to premium games, with in-game spending decreasing to 67% near 2031.</p>
<p>"It is time to say goodbye to "survive 'til 25" and hello to "stick 'til 26" and beyond, but with tempered expectations for future growth in this mature market. The market (again, also including hardware, software, and subscriptions) will grow from $236.9 billion in 2025 to $280.1 billion in 2031," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MiDiA Research.</p>
<p>While there will always be a debate within the gaming community about whether mobile gaming makes you a gamer, mobile continues to do a significant amount of lifting for software revenue, with 54% of all software revenue coming from mobile games. The significant premium games being released this year will also be a huge boost for revenue, especially with games like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civilization VII, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all being released in Q1.</p>
<p>"Things will continue to be difficult in the games market, and these challenging market conditions mean developers are being forced to think smarter to succeed. Luckily, the industry is teeming with some of the smartest, most creative, and passionate minds in the world," says Elliott.</p>

			<p>Fortnite OG has officially entered the next phase, going into Chapter 1, Season 2. There have been some re-added points of interest that are bound to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-sees-a-million-active-players-in-first-20-minutes/">nostalgia flowing</a> for those long-term Fortnite players, while others will get to experience the beginning of Fortnite for the first time. This, of course, includes places like Tilted Towers and Shifty Shafts. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/go-full-tilt-into-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other memorable areas</a>, such as Junk Junction, Haunted Hills, and Snobby Shores, have returned to the game after being gone for a while. If you want to see what to expect from the new season, you can check it out in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Go Full Tilt - Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 2 is Live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9b543Z6aus?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since it's a new season, a new battle pass comes along with it. The all-new OG Pass is out, offering players 45 tiers of rewards that are based on iconic moments throughout Chapter 1 Season 2. This includes items that are inspired by Sparkle Specialist and Black Knight, which were outfits that OG players would have been able to get in the original Chapter 1 Season 2 Battle Pass. It also includes the Cuddle Team Leader, which was an outfit that first came out during Chapter 1 Season 2.</p>
<p>This battle pass functions exactly the same as the other battle passes that are available in the game. You just have to play the game and get XP in any Fortnite experience, which will then add up and allow you to claim rewards across the battle pass. The OG pass is a single track combining both free and premium rewards. You can either purchase the pass for 1,000 V-Bucks or get it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew. The Season ends on March 25, giving you plenty of time to get your games in and unlock the rewards on the pass.</p>
<p>The loot pool has been expanded, introducing gear from the classic Chapter 1 Season 2, including items such as Cozy Campfire, Chug Jug, and Suppressed Pistol.</p>
<p>Alongside this event, the Valentine 2025 update has gone live in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, where you can wander around town spreading love and gaining the ability to earn a Cupid's Surprise. You can also get Flowers, Love Letters, and Heart Wands as gifts to give out. This update also comes with new daily activities that you can participate in. The<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-the-valentines-2025-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full details</a> have been posted on the official Fortnite website, where you can read all about it. The Valentine's event is due to end on February 21.</p>

			<p>The Chinese Room has just <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-advanced-combat-and-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the latest developer diary focused on Bloodlines 2 combat. It's a bit late on the schedule (it was originally meant to go live on January 29), but its content is well worth the wait, as the UK-based studio has provided several glimpses of what combat will look like when the first-person roleplaying game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases later this year</a>.</p>
<p>To begin with, Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley revealed that the team has taken care to make dedicated melee animations for each of the playable clans. Banu has a sharp and quick style, Ventrue's is firm and precise, Tremere has a greater reach since they like to have some space between them and their foes, and Brujah is more brutally straightforward.</p>
<p><iframe title="1. clan attacks" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169795?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>Regardless of which clan you'll pick, a Dashing ability is always available to Phyre. Not only is it useful to dodge attacks, but it can even be utilized aggressively, as dashing just as an enemy is attacking will break their attack and set them up for a counterattack.</p>
<p>Kicks are available, too, and there are even multiple types. Players can opt for a big swinging roundhouse if they're dealing with a group of enemies, while a powerful back-kick is ideal to send a single enemy flying, as shown below.</p>
<p><iframe title="2. counter attack" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169861?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>Telekinesis is also an extremely useful tool in the Bloodlines 2 combat system. Phyre can employ it to grab an enemy and feed upon them, as shown below, or to manipulate the environment. Things like bottles and ashtrays can be thrown to make a noise to distract enemies as part of the stealth toolset, while throwing explosives such as a gas tank is a more destructive way to deal with enemy groups.</p>
<p>Telekinesis can also pick up weapons from the dead, from knives to sniper rifles. This is where things can get interesting if mixing in Discipline abilities. For example, Brujah's taunting ability, when used with mass manipulation, lets Phyre force enemies to drop their weapons and literally turn on them. When using Possession, the lead character can take control of a foe and drop them from a building.</p>
<p><iframe title="3. tk enemy to feed" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169920?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>The Bloodlines 2 combat system will be augmented by four Elixirs that can be found and collected by playing the game. The Mending Elixir instantly restores health, while the Blood Elixir restores Blood Points to Phyre's abilities, which is particularly useful for combo chains. The Strength Elixir boosts damage done for some time, while the Fortitude Elixir reduces damage taken.</p>
<p>When the game launches, there will be three difficulty settings available to players: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The next developer diary, which will focus on the Masquerade in Seattle, is due on February 12.</p>
