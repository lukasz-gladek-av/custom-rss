			<p>The next two free games up for grabs as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a> are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/limbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limbo</a>.</p>
<p>The first game is the 2022 spin-off of the Borderlands series, built as a sequel of sorts to Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, a Borderlands 2 DLC. The premise is completely different and more familiar to fans of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons: the titular Tiny Tina is the dungeon master of a fictional tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses, and the twist is that she can modify the game world on the fly at her whim.</p>
<p>The game turned out to be quite successful in terms of sales (which exceeded the expectations of publisher Take-Two) and average critic score. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands earned an 8.5/10 score here on Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rosh Kelly</a>:</p>
<p><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, with its fantasy setting, tabletop homage, and constant references, takes the world exploration in a different direction. For the first time in the Borderlands IP, players will have an overworld to wander through, complete with side quests and secrets. This travel by map can make the locations feel a bit unconnected, but it also allows for a huge variety of places to delve into. And once you’ve reached your location, you’ll have the full experience you’re used to.</em></p>
<p>The other game gamers can grab for free this week on the Epic Games Store is Limbo, the masterpiece puzzle/platform/horror indie game released in 2010. Limbo was developed by Playdead, a Danish studio also known for 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside</a>. In the game, an unnamed boy roams traps and dangerous environments in the desperate search for his sister. Limbo received multiple awards and accolades, winning the coveted Game of the Year prize at the Game Developers Choice Awards and BAFTA Video Game Awards in 2010.</p>
<p>As usual, both games are available to be permanently added to your Epic Games Store library as long as you grab them before next Thursday at 5 PM.</p>

			<p>Developer FuturLab has released the final free content update for PowerWash Simulator as the team shifts all its focus to PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator was released in early access in 2021, and shortly after leaving early access, it reached more than <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/powerwash-simulator-has-topped-3-million-players">3 million players</a>. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/thank-you-for-17-million-powerwash-simulator-players">studio announced</a> that the game had reached more than 17 million players through game sales and its inclusion on services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The game has featured multiple free and paid updates in the last four years, collaborating with major series like Shrek, Spongebob Squarepants, Wallace &amp; Gromit, and more. The last free update for the game, titled 'The Muckingham Files 6', is now available on all platforms, and adds two more jobs and locations for players to clean up.</p>

<p>"<em><span>Whether you’ve been busting the grime with us from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we’d love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with</span></em><span> us,</span>" FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">writes in a blog post.</a></p>
<p>"<em><span>PowerWash Simulator has truly transformed FuturLab - it's helped us grow our team, evolve as a studio, and take on exciting new challenges.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-developer-warns-users-using-latest-graphics-cards-may-experience-frame-rate-drops/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign may not run well at launch on the "latest GPUs", forcing users to reduce graphics settings or resolution to avoid experiencing frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware shared the patch notes for the day one update, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-Patch101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.01</a>, which improves the handling of playable characters, adjusts the soundtrack, text and balance, adds character scenarios and addresses some unspecified bugs. Accompanying the official patch notes is a warning for PC users that PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops. This issue is under investigation, but anyone experiencing a significant drop is advised to turn down graphics settings from the default High to Medium or Low, or lower the game's resolution.</p>
<p>While it is not specified which new graphics cards currently have trouble running the game properly, it's very likely the Elden Ring Nightreign developer was talking about the NVIDIA RTX 50 series cards, as during my over 30 hours with Elden Ring Nightreign, I did not experience any significant performance issue on an RTX 4080. As such, if you own one of these new GPUs, it may be a good idea to hold off getting the game until the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>Performance issues on new GPUs and some glaring oversights, such as the lack of cross-platform play, Elden Ring Nightreign is an incredibly engaging experience that masterfully twists the typical Souls series formula to provide a fast-paced co-op experience that is hard to put down. You can learn more about this engaging experience with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
