			<p>Although it was only a CGI trailer featuring no gameplay, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the reveal of Larian Studios' Divinity</strong></a> was undoubtedly among the highlights of this year's The Game Awards, and for good reason, as the game is set to be even bigger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>It is not only the promise of a much bigger game that has got fans excited about Larian's next game. In true studio fashion, the reveal trailer held nothing back regarding dark and mature themes, and not to shock players, but to treat them with a level of intellectual respect, according to a studio representative.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on X, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Publishing director Michael Douse</a></strong> commented on the trailer's emphasis on dark themes, saying that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect"</em> came up a lot during planning. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It isn't about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The phrase "treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect" came up a lot in planning. It is about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This commitment to intellectual respect isn't surprising, considering how Larian has approached player agency in the past. Playing the "evil" or morally complex path in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong></a> is often designed to be just as interesting and nuanced as the selfless hero route. It is great to hear that the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't changed the studio's approach in creating three-dimensional worlds and stories that don't need to be sanitized to appeal to a wider range of players.</p>



<p>Divinity will mark Larian Studios' return to the franchise after Divinity: Original Sin 2, which launched in 2017 on PC and consoles. Despite the studio's long history with the franchise, the new game will mark <em>"the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before,"</em> and the <em>"Divinity we’ve always wanted to make,"</em> according to Larian CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/</link>
            <guid>1383295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, we have seen various performance improvements promised in patch notes, only to find that these improvements were so minor that they made no difference. Given <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">the long-standing performance issues in Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong>, there is obvious skepticism surrounding the <em>"over 100 performance improvements" </em>arriving <a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><strong>tomorrow with Title Update 4. </strong></a>Fortunately, fresh comparison videos released directly by CAPCOM confirm that these optimization steps are significant.</p>



<p>The two comparison videos, which can be watched below, compare performance between Title Update 3 and Title Update 4 in three fights against Arkveld, Xu Wu, and Lagiacrus on the recommended system configurations listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/"><strong>Steam</strong></a>:</p>



<p><strong>First Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>



<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *AMD FSR: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Second Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-10400</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (VRAM 8GB)</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *NVIDIA DLSS: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p>On both system configurations, all three scenarios see noticeable performance improvements. In the fight against Arkveld, the first configuration increases from an average of roughly 40 FPS in Title Update 3 to approximately 50 FPS in Title Update 4, with the second configuration experiencing similar performance improvements. Although the improvements in average FPS are promising already, performance stability also seems to have been improved, which should make the experience more enjoyable for all PC players.</p>

<p>The performance improvements of Title Update 4 are only the beginning, as Monster Hunter Wilds is set to get more enhancements in January and February, when the game's final Title Update will launch on all formats, coinciding with the game's first anniversary.  Hopefully, all the performance improvements and additional content will be enough for lapsed players to return, which is something <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>the producer wishes for</strong></a> and the game definitely deserves, as I highlighted in my launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a></strong>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-law-is-a-lot-more-intimate-than-cyberpunk-2077-says-creative-director/</link>
            <guid>1383244</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When NO LAW was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at The Game Awards 2025, it was hard not to draw a comparison with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The new project from Neon Giant, the studio behind The Ascent, is also set in a cyberpunk city, and it's a single player first-person open world shooter RPG, much like the more famous game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-celebrates-5th-anniversary-heavy-dsicount-new-trading-card-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently celebrated its fifth anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>In the first post-reveal interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-of-no-law-know-everyone-will-compare-it-to-cyberpunk-2077-but-there-are-important-differences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Neon Giant Co-Founder and Creative Director Tor Frick acknowledged the comparison but also explained why NO LAW is going to be a lot different from Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p><em>I think obviously every day we have to do that internally as well. Because we know what Cyberpunk is and we know people will compare us. But the game is very different and the world is very different. A lot of it is, it's just the mood and the tone. Cyberpunk is a big, sprawling experience. It's a mega city. And our game is a lot more intimate both when it comes to the gameplay mechanics but also the world. I think as people see more of the game that will be more apparent. It's hard to do in a short trailer like that. I think you need to see and feel the game more. It is more of an intimate experience, like the world is deep but not so grand. And the same thing with mechanics and the same thing with the story. It is very, very personal and very, very reactive around you as a player, rather than being set in this grand backdrop.</em></p>



<p>The studio's other Co-Founder and Creative Director, Arcade Berg, added that NO LAW also features a slight tongue-in-cheek tone like The Ascent, in contrast to Cyberpunk 2077's far more serious vibe. Other inspirations include 80s-90s action movies, which were also a bit campy, as well as Hong Kong action scenes, and even manga and anime.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, the main character, Grey Harker, is a seasoned veteran who chooses to retire from active military service following the severe injuries sustained during his previous deployment to pursue a life of peace. He had abandoned violence in favor of caring for his plants, but eventually, trouble walked through his door all the same, a bit like in John Wick, prompting him to return and make those who had wronged him pay.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X with no set release window. It will be published by KRAFTON, which acquired Neon Giant a few years ago.</p>

			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>
