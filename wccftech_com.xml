            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard provided an updated Overwatch 2 roadmap when it comes to the new Stadium Mode. According to the studio, this is currently the most played game mode by far, eclipsing Competitive and Quick Play modes. There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during the mode's launch week, and that's apparently more than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week (when OW Classic was added to Overwatch 2). In the mode's first week, 900 billion in Stadium cash were collectively earned, and 206 million items were chosen by players during rounds. Ironically, the most successful and yet also the least popular hero was Lucio.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest expressed by fans, Blizzard also took a step back to reveal its development history. Stadium was initially set up as an eight-team tournament that should have been as varied as possible. Each round, players would choose from random upgrades to use in PvP Team Deathmatch or PvE against the AI, losing health if they lost the round. However, it was challenging to develop a coherent strategy or build to counter opponents when decisions were made at random. Now, Blizzard still wants there to be variety from match to match, but it is no longer the top priority. The goal has shifted towards delivering a balanced and competitive mode, while at the same time allowing players to create epic builds through strategic decisions based on the performance and hero combinations of everyone in the match.</p>
<p>Stadium mode will have its builds and Hero balance tweaked in an upcoming mid-season balance patch after Blizzard has collected all the data and feedback. When it comes to new content, the latest hero (Freya) will also be the next to be available in the mode when the midseason patch goes live in Overwatch 2. That's just the beginning, as Blizzard wants to release new heroes on a regular basis to Stadium. Season 17, slated to debut next month, will introduce Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta, in addition to the new maps of Esperanca and Samoa, Custom Games, the ability to save and share builds, and crossplay. It's important to note that this is still a Competitive game mode, which means PC and console players will be in separate groups. However, the developers are looking into coming up with an Unranked mode which could bring everyone together without harming the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Season 18 will land in August, adding Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte as new Stadium heroes. Players will also find two new maps (New Route 66 and London), the new game mode Payload race, new All-Star Rewards, and the Stadium Trials feature. From Season 19 onward, Overwatch 2 will get a New China map, new heroes with every season, Draft Mode, new consumables, and item upgrades. With Payload race, Blizzard is also adding a new mechanic called Quests, where players will select a random quest that will provide rewards when completed.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with adding in-game perks. It seems like they're finally willing to shake up the game's core after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzards-steam-debut-stumbles-hard-as-overwatch-2-becomes-worst-reviewed-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly underwhelming launch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was finally revealed after weeks of leaks, many RPG fans began to worry for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur was a brand-new RPG released just days after the Oblivion remaster, and the concern was that Oblivion would swallow up all the attention from Clair Obscur. On the outside, it looked like Xbox had screwed Clair Obscur in a big way.</p>
<p>That was not the case, as Clair Obscur surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies sold</a> days after its launch, and is one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">best-rated</a> games of 2025 so far.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a> showed that not only did Clair Obscur not get swallowed up by Oblivion, but the two seemingly helped each other. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass, so it's not a surprise that, per Ampere Analysis' data, the majority of players for both Oblivion and Clair Obscur were Xbox players.</p>
<p>What is interesting, though, is that 55% of players who played Clair Obscur on Xbox also played Oblivion. 35% of all Expedition 33 players also played Oblivion, showing huge overlap between the two. As Kelper Interactive's portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told The Game Business, "<em>I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.</em>"</p>
<p>Handrahan also spoke about how Clair Obscur's inclusion in the Xbox's summer showcase ahead of the game's release was a major help.</p>
<p>"<em>[During the Summer Showcase] our game was placed alongside Gears of War, Fable and products that are very traditionally known as AAA products,</em>" Handrahan said.</p>
<p>"<em>It let people understand what it was in a way that I think we would've struggled to do if we weren't allied with Xbox in that way. We couldn’t have done it through a Steam demo alone, for example. It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way. Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers.</em>"</p>
<p>Xbox's support in the showcase is a clear help to Clair Obscur, but it's more interesting and hopeful to see that the shadow drop of such a massive RPG was able to help catapult the release of a new entry to the genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announced-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-surpassed-2-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced today that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, its 2D action platformer from the Ubisoft Montpellier team, has gone "<em>well over</em>" 2 million players since it launched at the top of 2024.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1917609908024856659">X</a>, Ubisoft announced the milestone with a short message that ended with what could be read as a hint that there's more to come regarding The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>"<em>Well over 2M players by now</em>," the post began. "<em>You've revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up.</em>"</p>
<p>That could hint that there's more to come related to The Lost Crown, but that feels unlikely because <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">Ubisoft disbanded the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that made The Lost Crown</a>. More likely, the tease is referring to the fact that there are other Prince of Persia games in the works, like the ongoing development of the early access game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was rebooted partway through development.</p>
<p>Sure, Ubisoft could try to get the Montpellier team back together. It certainly wouldn't be the first time the executive branch of a big game publisher/developer went back on a decision everyone and their mother could have told them was poor and short-sighted. If that's what's happening, then great! But it doesn't feel likely.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was undoubtedly Ubisoft's best game of 2024. Just because it didn't meet Ubisoft's sales expectations doesn't mean it wasn't a success. It had the best critical reception of any game Ubisoft released in 2024 and was one of the best games released in 2024, period.</p>
<p>Ubisoft could have taken the win of The Lost Crown being regarded as one of the best games they'd made in a long time, and focused on helping that team succeed again. Instead, they scattered that team to the wind, adding to the very public mess that Ubisoft continues to find itself in.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Ubisoft does not hold the Prince of Persia series in the same regard as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. If it did, Prince of Persia would also be part of that <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">new holding company</a>. Considering what happened with The Lost Crown, fans of the storied series have no reassurance from Ubisoft that they should actually be excited for whatever is next with the Prince of Persia series.</p>

			<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year, it came out of nowhere and immediately captured the attention of role-playing game enthusiasts. With traditional party-based role-playing games finding less and less representation in the AAA space, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive looked like the game that could bring the genre into the spotlight without being a nostalgia-fueled experience, as the setting, story and main cast of characters looked very unique, and far removed from those we are now used to see in similar games. In the end, the game's dark fantasy Belle Époque setting, the members of Expedition 33, and the turn-based combat system with a twist weren't just a fluke meant to lure in jaded fans of classic RPGs. They are the well-developed elements that make up one of the best role-playing games released recently.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425004620_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 is set in a ruined world where the mysterious goddess known as the Paintress holds sway over the people of the isolated island of Lumière, a beautiful place inspired by Paris, which broke off from the rest of the Continent following the Fracture. For the past 67 years, the inhabitants of the island have been subject to the Gommage, a twisted ritual where the Paintress draws a decreasing number, which causes the death of every human with an age above that number. To stop the Paintress from decimating humanity, the people of Lumière send expeditions into the continent, which often end in ruin, but not before they manage to leave behind something that could be for those that will come after.</p>
<p>Following yet another Gommage where the Paintress painted the number 33, the members of Expedition 33 head over to the Continent, hoping to achieve what the previous Expeditions couldn't. Unfortunately, the group is decimated as soon as it lands on the continent by a mysterious man who has evidently lived well past 33 years. The few survivors, who include the engineer Gustave, his foster sister Maelle, the scholar Lune, and the warrior Sciel, following protocol, continue nonetheless towards their objective, not knowing that the world dominated by the Paintress and the Gommage is a lot more complicated than they initially thought.</p>
<p>The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's setting and story have been influenced by NieR Automata, with its ruined world inhabited by some rather unique creatures, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3, with humans whose life has a set duration dictated by some higher power, but even so, they are fascinating and engaging. Much of the enjoyment of the game's story, which manages to convincingly alternate between world-building, intimate character development, fist-pumping epic confrontations, mystery, and heartbreaking tragedies, comes from the excellent pacing that somewhat reminded me of what I consider the best-paced role-playing games ever made: Chrono Trigger.</p>
<p>Like the Square Enix classic, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 doesn't inflate the play time. Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425014015_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in role-playing games in a long time.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of classic franchises like the Final Fantasy series, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 plays a lot like a traditional Japanese role-playing game, although with many twists that make both exploration and combat extremely engaging. Of the core gameplay elements, exploration and traversal are the most straightforward. Controlling characters from a third-person perspective, players explore a variety of locations scattered all over the world map, featuring multiple paths to the location's main objective, usually an intense boss battle, filled with secrets to discover, shortcuts, and so on. The game doesn't feature any navigational pointers or location maps, which makes exploring more immersive and organic than similar games, though some sort of navigational pointer would have been welcome.</p>
<p>Unlike most modern role-playing games developed in Japan and those inspired by them, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also features a proper world map, much like each location, filled with optional locations and secrets to discover. At the very start of the adventure, the game feels a little too linear with little to do other than go from one main story location to the next, but after only a few hours in, the game opens up, providing players with plenty of opportunities to unlock new content such as outfits and hairstyles for all characters, additional weapons with different elemental properties and passive skills, Pictos to customize their abilities, and take down more Nevrons roaming the map. On the main world map and inside locations, enemies are visible and generally very easy to avoid, which is a definite plus, as random encounters tend to impact the experience negatively if not appropriately handled.</p>
<p>Though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based combat system doesn't appear to be much different from any other similar system, Sandfall Interactive has done an incredible job making it highly engaging and satisfying within the boundaries of the classic mechanics. Except for regular attacks with the equipped weapons, items, and a few skills, every combat action requires some involvement from the player besides selecting the command. Almost every skill, of which every character can equip up to six, comes with a simple QTE event that, once cleared correctly, increases its efficacy. It's during defensive actions, however, that clearing QTE becomes more important, as the game offers multiple defensive options that expand as the adventure proceeds, which are more or less effective depending on the situation and the enemy. Dodging attacks is the easiest option that doesn't offer too many rewards besides negating all damage; parrying, on the other hand, is more challenging to pull off consistently, but it's infinetly more rewarding, as characters that parry attacks not only negate any damage, but also restore AP, which are used to perform the aforementioned skills, and Aim attacks, which can be customized to deal status effects alongside damage and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427131135_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if all characters played the same in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, these mechanics would have been more than enough to make each battle thrilling and exciting, but the developer went the extra mile to give each one of the playable characters some very unique playstyles. Gustave, for example, accumulates charges for his mechanical arm, which can be then used once charged to deal massive damage and stun enemies if the Break gauge has been filled; Maelle, to make another, can enter three different stances that grant offense and defense bonuses and can enhance the effects of specific skills; Lune acquires Essences when using her elemental spells, which can be consumed to enhance the effects of every spell.</p>
<p>Each character's unique playstyle includes a massive selection of skills learned via individual Skill Trees that further define how each character is played, in conjunction with the passive abilities learned via Pictos, which are incredibly varied and can enhance pretty much every aspect of a character both offensively and defensively, and even the order in which each character attacks. Verso, to make an example, is extremely good at restoring his own AP, and has skills that allow him to act twice in a turn, and restore the AP of the other party members, so the other party members skill loadout can be built around this mechanic with powerful skills that require a lot of AP.</p>
<p>Sciel, whose unique Foretell mechanics make her extremely powerful, has a skill that can stack Foretell on multiple enemies if they are afflicted by Burn, so building the party around this skill can be highly effective. The game is filled to the brim with these options, and even a single playthrough may not be enough to discover all of them, something that lends extremely well to the extensive endgame and New Game Plus, which offer additional challenges beyond Expert difficulty, which, by itself, is pretty challenging even on a first playthrough, requiring perfect execution of the defensive options to clear even regular enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's intriguing setting and charming characters are made even more so by the game's visuals. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game emnploys all the core rendering techniques offered by the engine like Lumen and Nanite - to deliver dense environments with a clear visual identity, tons of detail and generally accurate lighting, though some imperfections creep in now and then, and bloom is maybe a little excessive at times. Character models look as good as the environment, if not even better, thanks to some great animations (especially facial ones) that make each character strikingly believable, even with the average lip-syncing on display. Taking full advantage of all the above are the masterfully directed cutscenes, with a high-quality level that wouldn't look amiss in a proper movie or TV show.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427133400_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though games powered by Unreal Engine 5 usually suffer from considerable performance issues on PC, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is among the few that don't, at least not massively. On the system used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and Epic settings, the game ran at an average of 61 FPS, 24 FPS 1% low during a benchmark session held on the world map and the Monoco's Station and Frozen Hearts locations which feature tons of particle effects, complete with some battles. Things fared slightly better turning down every setting to High, as in the same scenario, the game ran at an average of 75 FPS, 28 FPS 1% low with minimal differences in visual quality. During traversal, I experienced minimal stuttering, and the most noticeable drops happened during combat, thankfully not when the enemy was about to attack my party, so generally they weren't too bothersome.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Quality, Epic Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJtfNqJNxXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even more than visuals, the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack and voice acting are top-notch. The adventure's main theme, which is woven into multiple tracks, is immediately recognizable and sets the melancholic tone of the adventure incredibly well. That is not to say that the entirety of the soundtrack is composed of sad, haunting pieces influenced by the NieR series soundtracks, as there are some surprisingly upbeat and catchy tunes, like the Gestral Beach themes, that are difficult to resist tapping a foot in time with. Likewise, while playing the game with the French voice acting makes for a more authentic experience, given the game's setting, the quality of the English voice acting is, as already mentioned, stellar. Every voice actor clearly poured their hearts into their performance, often surpassing everything they have done before bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</p>
