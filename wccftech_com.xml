			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-guide-how-to-get-your-custom-loadout">Battlefield REDSEC Guide - How to Get Your Custom Loadout</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/football-manager-2026-is-the-series">The Game Business</a> once again reveals the latest GSD sales data, and which games made the top-10 on Europe's sales charts for last week (November 2-9). While previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-back-in-top-spot-eu-sales-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-drops-to-third/">weeks have been dominated by Battlefield 6</a>, last week's sales tell a different story, with Football Manager 26 roaring into the top spot to knock Battlefield off, at least for a week.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled</a>, it was even more critical for SEGA and Sports Interactive that Football Manager 26 was a success, and so far, at least commercially, that's been the case. According to The Game Business, not only is this a big release for the Football Manager series, it's the biggest launch in the history of GSD releasing these weekly sales charts, a practice it started back in 2017.</p>



<p>That said, for all its commercial success, Football Manager 26 has not gone over well with players, with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/">player reviews categorized as 'Mostly Negative' on the game's Steam page</a>. Still, those negative reviews today won't change the fact that, at least for a week, Football Manager 26 sits at the top of the EU's sales charts in both units sold and revenue.</p>



<p>Despite being toppled, Battlefield 6 did not fall too far down the list, remaining in the top three at the number two spot for both revenue and units sold. It's followed by EA Sports FC 26, which has also been one of the leading titles in recent weeks, followed by Pokémon Legends Z-A and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment in fourth and fifth place, respectively, on the units sold chart. On the revenue chart, they swap places, with Pokémon in fifth place and Hyrule Warriors in fourth.</p>



<p>Other notable entries in the top-10 lists include Ghost of Yotei, which came in at the eighth spot for units sold and the sixth spot for revenue, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which made the units sold list in ninth place and the revenue list in seventh. </p>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei continues to ride the wave of its first month and a half on the market, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 re-enters the charts <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">thanks to a mixture of a free trial weekend where players on Steam and Xbox could try the game for free</a>, and get the game at a discounted price with all of their progress made in the free trial carrying over. The free weekend and discount were also timed with the release of the game's third and final DLC expansion, which drew even more players back to it after it launched at the start of this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-10 games in the EU for units sold for last week (November 2-9):</p>



<ol>
<li>Football Manager 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</li>
