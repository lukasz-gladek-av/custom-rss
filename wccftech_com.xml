			<p>Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10-year anniversary at the beginning of this month, on December 1, 2025, and as part of the celebrations, Ubisoft has put out <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/events/wildcards-siege">a new limited-time mode titled Wildcards</a>, which'll be available from December 15, 2025, to January 5, 2026.</p>



<p>The new mode takes players back through the game's history by making every match more chaotic than the last with different modifiers. A modifier could limit your choice of operator, of weapons, and even add a new element to gameplay, like a massive Chicken appearing in your face as a callback to an iconic moment in Rainbow Six Siege's 10-year history.</p>



<p>There are 28 total modifiers, including Multipick, which lets teams pick the same Operator multiple times. Frag Domination, which randomly spawns frag grenades during the round. Frag Grenade Cooking, which equips attackers with the 556XI and defenders with the MP5K. Both teams still get grenades they can cook and throw.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Each round begins with a vote, where players will vote for their preferred modifier. Votes from both attackers and defenders are tallied together, and in the case of a tie, a modifier is randomly selected. It's a purposely chaotic mode that seems to try to hit at all of Siege's best points.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege recently underwent its most significant change in the last decade when it became a free-to-play game with the Rainbow Six Siege X update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">which Ubisoft released this past June</a>. It was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/">biggest graphical update in the game's history</a>, and gave players the chance to, for free, play unranked, quick match, and dual front modes and play as a small selection of Operators. </p>



<p>You can take advantage of that free content as much as you like, and if you do want to go further in the game, you can grab the Elite Edition, which adds 16 more Operators and access to all game modes, ranked playlists, and the Siege Cup for $19.99. The Ultimate Edition includes all of that and access to all 52 Operators for $39.99.</p>

			<p>Bungie has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new ViDoc for Marathon, the upcoming first-person extraction shooter game based on the studio's classic sci-fi franchise. The developer, known for creating the Halo and Destiny IPs, has confirmed that the game will be released in March 2026, as its parent company (Sony Interactive Entertainment) <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had previously suggested</a>.</p>



<p>The ViDoc, titled 'Vision of Marathon', goes in-depth to present the developers' design for their new project. According to the creators, Marathon is designed to showcase Bungie's core strengths, chiefly tight, satisfying gunplay; deep, strange science-fiction worldbuilding; and high-stakes PvP, layered into a larger PvPvE experience. Ultimately, the goal is for every part of the game to align, allowing controllers and interfaces to disappear, so that players can fully immerse themselves in the tension and risk/reward of their run. On that note, Bungie described Marathon as 'gunfight poker' precisely because every session is all about deciding what to risk, when to push deeper, and when to extract before losing the hard-earned gear. By the way, proximity chat has been added to the game in response to community feedback.  The tool can conceivable be used to create fragile, temporary alliances even outside the premade group players joined the session with.</p>



<p>Visually, the developers envisioned gritty, grounded visuals that clearly differentiate between bright, bleached sunny days and oppressive storms. It's all in service of making Tau Ceti IV feel like a very real, very hostile place. Corpses are persistent and decay over time; intact bodies signal recent kills and imminent danger, while decomposed ones suggest older fights and relative safety, turning environmental storytelling into a gameplay read. Marathon's audio design focuses on providing positional information to the keenest-eared players, such as how footsteps sound on different materials, vertical cues, and AI bark. Similarly, composer Ryan Lott describes a score that purposely accentuates tension, horror, and adrenaline rather than traditional heroics, reinforcing specific locations and situations.</p>



<p>Marathon will feature four named zones, each with distinct layouts, threats, and pacing.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Outer Rim</strong> is the beginner‑friendly edge of the colony: more spread out, with safer pockets and clearer sightlines that showcase the settlement’s scale, but still lethal thanks to UESC patrols that treat Runners as trespassing criminals.</li>



<li><strong>Dread Swamp</strong> pushes deeper into environmental horror, featuring anomalous aberration sites where strange entities erupt from the ground; its overlapping combat spaces and near‑continuous fights make it ideal for players seeking dense PvE action and enemy farming.</li>



<li><strong>The Outpost</strong> is a compact yet highly vertical UESC facility dominated by the Windmill, a spiraling maze of corridors, traps, drones, tripwires, and harsh weather, offering top-tier loot at a high risk.</li>



<li><strong>Cryo Archive (the Marathon ship)</strong> is billed as the apex endgame zone, which, as you would expect, also features the game's hardest content. It is massive, freezing, and hostile, combining the most dangerous environmental hazards, the toughest UESC units yet, and sequential vaults that grow in difficulty, culminating in a seventh vault that holds both the best rewards and crucial revelations about what really happened.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each zone has dynamic weather and large scale events that will not trigger every run, but when they do, they can dramatically reshape a session, forcing players to reassess plans and routes.</p>



<p>Bungie devs claimed that there will be 'absurd' amounts of loot to find in the zones, including over 400 weapon mods, multiple implant types, Runner cores, and shell variants with different playstyles (tank, stealth assassin, hunter of stealth players, etc.). Weapons are designed to be visually distinctive and readable in animation, with gold‑tier mods capable of radically changing behavior, even going as far as turning an SMG into a needle rifle, or making a melee‑oriented pistol gain a suppressor that grants invisibility on kills, which in turn combines with other perks and shell abilities to create stealth‑focused builds. Cores, implants, and shell traits can be combined to raise stats and alter mechanics. For example, a Thief shell could gain a second grappling hook, and a Destroyer could deploy a riot barrier that converts absorbed shield damage into offensive output.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>To keep Marathon approachable to newcomers to the extraction shooter genre, Bungie introduced <strong>Rook</strong>, a prototype Runner shell and special mode in the game. Joining a match as Rook makes it easier to drop into in‑progress runs with minimal gear but no real risk: players can roam zones, scavenge freely, and extract without putting their main inventory on the line, providing a way to learn maps, test tactics, or stage comebacks after heavy losses.</p>



<p>In-game progression is tied to <strong>faction agents</strong>, each representing different corporations or groups (Trelex, MIDA, Arachne, CyberAcme, New Calorie, and others) who hire Runners for specific contract objectives. Each faction features a reputation track with apex unlocks at the top, granting the best gold‑tier items and also permanent base‑stat upgrades to Runners that persist for the rest of a season, thus adding a seasonal metagame layer.</p>



<p>The progression hub is also the lore hub in this game. Players will find everything in <strong>The</strong> <strong>Codex</strong>, which tracks achievements, collectibles, audio logs, and items discovered during runs. As players find more artifacts, they are bound to unlock deeper narrative context about what the items are, why they are so valuable, and who once cared about them, while simultaneously earning cosmetic rewards such as Runner skins, weapon skins, charms, stickers, emblems, profile backgrounds, and titles.</p>



<p>There won't be any pay-to-win mechanics, and gameplay outcomes (exfil or death) are never determined by spending, the developers have promised. Rewards passes will not expire, and players can earn rewards from previously purchased passes at any time. It is also going to be possible to buy past Rewards Passes.</p>



<p>As we already knew, the game (which will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) won't use the free-to-play model, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be a full-price premium title</a>, either. Today, it was confirmed that the studio is targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99, with additional regional pricing to be announced later. Buying the game provides access to all gameplay updates (maps, Runner shells, events, etc.) as the year progresses. The Cryo Archive, the first deck on the UESC Marathon ship, will open during Season 1. More details on seasonal content and roadmap are coming closer to launch, in January 2026.</p>



<p>As a reminder, Marathon was internally supposed to launch in 2024, but it was quietly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to 2025</a> when the studio suffered a round of layoffs in October 2023. Later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the official launch date to be September 23, 2025. However, following a mixed reception to previous testing rounds (and the weight of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord's recent failure</a>, as far as Sony was concerned), Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a delay in June</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced it has acquired the MOBA game March of Giants from Amazon, with the Montreal-based team becoming a part of Ubisoft when the deal closes on its expected date of December 16, 2025. Though the MOBA will be officially owned by Ubisoft, as part of the deal, Amazon will still provide marketing support for the game on Twitch.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release, where Ubisoft says it "<em>sees March of Giants as an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game</em>."</p>



<p>The March of Giants team is led by creative director Xavier Marquis and senior production leader Alexandre Parizeau, two developers who have previously worked at Ubisoft in their careers. Marquis was the original creative director of Rainbow Six Siege, and Parizeau was the former managing director of the Ubisoft Toronto studio.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="March of Giants: Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle</em>," Marquis said in a press release. "<em>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level</em>."</p>



<p>Parizeau added, "<em>My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs</em>."</p>



<p>For Amazon's part, Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch, and games at Amazon, added, "<em>We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants. We're confident that under Ubisoft's leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences</em>."</p>



<p>This acquisition comes shortly after Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">laid off 14,000+ workers this past October</a>, with a significant portion of those cuts impacting the teams at Amazon Game Studios. As a result of the cuts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">New World: Aeternum's development was shuttered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">an MMO Lord of the Rings game was cancelled for a second time</a>. </p>



<p>Though Amazon recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/"> two upcoming Tomb Raider games at The Game Awards</a>, this sale to Ubisoft is the latest sign of the company narrowing its focus in the video game industry and seemingly prioritizing game development only with established IPs and adaptations of video games, since the company doesn't seem inclined to slow down production on adaptations like<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/"> Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>



<p>That said, Amazon's loss seems like a win for Ubisoft. Regarding the acquisition, chief executive officer Yves Guillemot said, "<em>March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Gets New Free Content on December 16]]></title>

            <guid>1383757</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World is expanding STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl with new free content tomorrow on all platforms, as revealed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the PlayStation Blog</a> by the Ukrainian studio. Players can look forward to the following additions:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 quests that can take hours to complete</li>



<li>7 locations to explore</li>



<li>6 characters with their own backgrounds and stories</li>



<li>A unique weapon</li>



<li>A hub to create</li>
</ul>



<p>This new questline begins, as is often the case in STALKER 2 missions, with strange occurrences near the Malachite in the west of the map. Research groups sent by scientists reported a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. Stalkers who listened to it suffered from headaches, nosebleeds, and even hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed all of this first-hand. Although he was good at scientific research, he did not know enough about radio signals to figure out what was happening. This is where Banzai, a radio enthusiast who also joined the investigation, steps in. However, something must have gone wrong.</p>



<p>After logging into STALKER 2 once the patch has gone live, players will be able to hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Should they choose to investigate, the developers recommend paying close attention to the Red Forest region on the map. Ultimately, it will be up to their intuition, rationality, and choices to reveal how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl Update | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KCLiw3e-b8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the bullet point list, those who have already finished the game will find that some familiar locations are now resettled by fellow Stalkers. The locations include Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p>



<p>The new weapon is the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players. It includes a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope, and its trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p>



<p>Lastly, depending on the choices made in the new questline, STALKER 2 players can also unlock a new hub in the Burnt Forest region. Players can look forward to amenities such as the technician, trader, medic, and guide NPCs, a bed to rest, and access to their stash.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> GSC Game World about the PlayStation 5 launch that took place last month. Among other things, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got confirmation</a> that the first official DLC will launch next year. On the other hand, there's no news yet on the multiplayer mode promised before the original release.</p>
