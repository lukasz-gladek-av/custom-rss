			<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission started issuing refunds to consumers impacted by Epic Games' practices in Fortnite, which led to unwanted purchases of perks, emotes, and other in-game elements.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, the FTC confirmed that it is sending its first batch of payments to impacted users, totaling 629,344, half of them in checks and the other in PayPal transfers. The remaining payments will be sent at a later date. The average payment is around $114.</p>
<p>This first batch of refunds for Epic Games users is being set as part of a settlement reached back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-to-pay-520m-to-the-ftc-as-settlement-over-fortnite-privacy-case/">December 2022</a>. The FTC charged the publisher with deploying shady tactics to drive unwanted purchases of virtual currency in Fortnite to purchase outfits, perks, and emotes. For this violation, Epic Games had to pay $245 million in fines, which the FTC is using to issue the refunds that started making their way to impacted users today.</p>
<p>This isn't the only violation Epic Games was fined for by the Federal Trade Commission. The Fortnite publisher was also charged with violating the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), collecting information from children under 13 who played the popular battle royale game without verifiable consent from a parent and making parents jump through hoops to have their children's data deleted, an issue that has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been addressed</a>. This violation cost Epic Games $275 million, bringing the total fine to $520 million.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Croatian game developer Croteam announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the first entry in the adventure franchise. A substantial visual upgrade is the first thing you'll notice, but there's a lot more, according to the studio.</p>
<p>Reawakened includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Gehenna expansion</a> and adds a brand new chapter called In the Beginning. Croteam says the new content explores the Simulation's origins and the challenges of its first test, adding new layers to the game's philosophical and narrative depth. Moreover, the developer will release a puzzle editor with The Talos Principle: Reawakened to empower&nbsp;modders to build unique worlds and challenges for the whole community.</p>

			<p>Rocksteady has <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will end in January 2025 with the release of Season 4's Episode 8. That's not surprising in the least, since the game was a massive flop in terms of sales (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> publisher Warner Bros. Games a 41% decrease in Q2 2024 revenue) and critical reception. Here on Wccftech, reviewer Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 5 out of 10 at launch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Those steep discounts have arrived, though. For the recently ended Steam Autumn sale, the game was 95% off. Now it's back at full price, but there will likely be another large discount with the Holiday sale that starts in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rocksteady also improved Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in various ways throughout the past year, keeping the full announced plan of four post-launch seasons, which introduced new maps and playable characters: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-season-1-roadmap-joker-coming-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Freeze</a>, Lawless, and now Deathstroke, who was added with today's update. Deathstroke features a close-range, melee combat playstyle powered by his sword. This is complemented by the following firearms: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/M04_Mayhem_10-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new seasonal episode also introduces a new medieval-like Elseworld inspired by DC's Dark Knights of Steel comic book series. Last but certainly not least, the new update adds the long-awaited Offline Mode, allowing players to experience all content released for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League without an Internet connection. However, all online features will also remain available for the time being, so co-op play is still going to be an option.</p>
<p>As for what's next for Rocksteady, it's worth reminding that the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> by layoffs a few months ago. The rumor is that they've been working <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a Director's Cut for Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Then, perhaps, they'll return to the Batman: Arkham franchise, though it will inevitably take a few years.</p>
