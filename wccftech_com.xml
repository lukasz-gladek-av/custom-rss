			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a>, <strong>KONAMI</strong> and <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong> have unveiled the first gameplay trailer for <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>. The spin-off psychological horror game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced back in 2022</a></strong>, and this is the first time we learn anything concrete about it. Meanwhile, the development team, originally known as <strong>No Code</strong> (the same ones behind <strong>Stories Untold</strong> and <strong>Observation</strong>), has rebranded to <strong>Screen Burn</strong>.</p>



<p>More information was revealed in the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, where the game was described as a full-length, self-contained adventure <strong>set in cold Scotland</strong> and <span><strong>played entirely in first-person</strong>, marking</span> a significant shift from the series' usual third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Writer and director <strong>Jon McKellan</strong> said:</p>



<p><em>Our main objectives were to make a game that could feel specific to the team who made it, to bring something new to the series in terms of setting and to really think about what Silent Hill, both in concept and gameplay, could look like through a Screen Burn lens.</em></p>



<p>According to Screen Burn, <strong>the first-person perspective fundamentally reshapes how players experience Silent Hill's horror</strong>. Lead Game Designer <strong>Graeme McKellan</strong> emphasized that the limited field of view creates tension through what happens off-screen, noting that <strong>what happens off-screen is sometimes even scarier than what happens right in front of the player</strong>.</p>



<p>Combat offers familiar tools to players, such as planks of wood, pipes, and firearms, but also introduces meaningful choices between confrontation and evasion. <strong>A peeking gameplay mechanic allows the protagonist, Simon Ordell, to lean carefully around corners and over walls</strong>, assessing threats before committing to action. </p>



<p>Screen Burn's signature analog technology aesthetic manifests in the CRTV, <strong>a handheld pocket television that reimagines Silent Hill's iconic radio</strong>. Players physically bring up the device and manually tune through frequencies to discover narrative content and detect enemy positions. Graeme McKellan added:</p>



<p><em>We really wanted the player to bring it up and actually use it. The analog tech, that's kind of been my visual calling card. Most of the things we've done, even in our previous games, has been as close to real-life technology as we can get.</em></p>



<p>The developers have described the main character of Silent Hill: Townfall as a <strong>layered, uncertain, and deeply human being</strong> who returns to the island town of St. Amelia after receiving a mysterious phone call asking him to come to the island and put things to rest.</p>



<p>Jon McKellan confirmed <strong>guilt serves as a central theme</strong>, explored through different manifestations: </p>



<p><em>Guilt is a strong theme throughout Silent Hill's many stories, and I wanted to dive deeper into the various different ways that guilt can manifest. Where it comes from, what it can do to people, and how, if you can, come to accept or resolve it. </em></p>



<p>The narrative <strong>maintains Screen Burn's signature mystery-driven storytelling</strong>, with players gradually uncovering both small details and major reveals as they meet other characters whose connections to Simon prove crucial. Some mysteries resolve as the game progresses, while others will only deepen, <strong>inviting players to explore every corner of the town</strong>. </p>



<p>The inspiration for St. Amelia <strong>draws heavily from real locations along Scotland's east coast, particularly fishing villages like St Monans</strong>. The development team conducted extensive location scouting, capturing not just visuals but the atmosphere, smell, wind, and sound of these coastal settlements.</p>



<p>A key inspiration came from the so-called <strong>Haar</strong>, a dense fog that rolls in along Scotland's east coast. Jon McKellan recalled an early research trip where the fog became so thick that he and his brother lost sight of the coast and couldn't determine which direction it was. The fog is, of course, a fundamental element of mystery in the whole series, so <strong>it was a perfect fit for Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>, too.</p>



<p>Screen Burn <strong>only employs around 30 developers</strong>, but this is still going to be a full-length game, and publisher Annapurna Interactive said <strong>it's going to be one of the biggest games they've published yet</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a></strong> might have the words 'awards' in the title, but anyone who has seen <strong>Geoff Keighley's</strong> annual show knows that it's more about the announcements than the awards. The <strong>DICE Awards,</strong> however, are the absolute opposite. It's all about the awards, and it's all about the people who make the games that win those awards.</p>



<p>With the nominees and winners selected by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences (AIAS)</strong>, it's arguably the closest thing the video game industry has to The Oscars, if only because every winner gives thanks to "<em>the academy</em>."</p>



<p>Leading into this year's show, the expectation was that <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was going to be the game to run away with every big award for the night. <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> and Expedition 33 came into the show <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">tied with eight nominations apiece,</a> and Expedition 33 was coming off a full sweep of all the awards it was nominated in at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>So when it began the evening by winning the <strong>Role-Playing Game of the Year</strong> category, it felt like we were in for another night of Expedition-wins-all-the-awards-33-times.</p>

<p>But then Ghost of Yōtei took home <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Character.</strong> Two awards whose equivalents went to Expedition 33 at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a> and at the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It felt like there was a chance that this would be the one awards show where Expedition 33 did not dominate the night.</p>



<p>But that's not exactly how the DICE Awards went. Expedition 33 took home <strong>five awards total</strong>, including <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Story,</strong> in <strong>Game Direction</strong>, <strong>Art Direction, </strong>and the big award of the night, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>, which extends its lead as <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/">the game with the most GOTY wins ever</a> by one.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei came up behind it with <strong>three wins</strong>, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong> went back-to-back with its <strong>two wins</strong> of the night, taking home the awards for <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Game Design</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong> was the other multi-winner of the evening, and the only one not included in the GOTY nominees. Of those nominees, <strong>Dispatch</strong> was the only game to walk away empty-handed, with <strong>ARC Raiders,</strong> the game that's easily the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">best-selling title so far</a> among the GOTY nominees, bringing home the award for <strong>Online Game of the Year.</strong></p>

<p>Other highlights of the night included a particularly emotional tribute to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-game-devs-share-stories-after-tragic-loss/">Vince Zampella</a></strong>, one of the modern video game industry's most influential creators, and not just because he was one of the co-creators of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. His impact as a mentor to younger generations of developers and his ability to leave his mark on everyone who worked with him were beautifully expressed, and showed how the developers he inspired will be the greater legacy he leaves behind.</p>



<p>The other major tribute of the night went to <strong>Naughty Dog</strong> veteran <strong>Evan Wells</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-co-president-evan-wells-retires/">who retired in 2023</a> after working at the studio for a quarter of a century, most of it as the studio's lead. He was inducted into the DICE Hall of Fame and was introduced by long-time colleague and the person who succeeded him, <strong>Neil Druckmann</strong>.</p>



<p>And a tribute made by everyone who got the chance to have a few moments with a microphone tonight was to their video game industry peers in the room and around the world. Nearly everyone who spoke tonight delivered some kind of solidarity message to other developers, calling for a more sustainable industry where developers are treated fairly and with respect for one another and the craft of making video games.</p>



<p>Which, for <strong>Double Fine Productions</strong> art director, <strong>Lee Petty</strong>, includes knowing that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">GenAI</a></strong> "<em>sucks</em>" and that instead of using those tools for things like animation, "<strong><em>you should hire a f***ing animator</em></strong>," comments that were part of his bit ahead of presenting the award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation.</p>



<p>Petty wasn't the only one to make their negative feelings about GenAI clear, and considering the fact that in that room tonight were likely video game industry executives who may have just pushed new policies encouraging or even mandating employees to start using GenAI tools, it couldn't help but feel like some back-talk aimed at those execs. Even more so for Petty when you consider who <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Double Fine's parent company is</a>.</p>



<p>With the DICE Awards wrapped, the last major awards night that'll look back on 2025 still to come is the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC Awards</a></strong>, where, you may be shocked to learn, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a nomination in almost every single available category. We'll see if it can pull off another sweep, or if one of either Blue Prince, Ghost of Yōtei, <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza</strong>, or <strong>Split Fiction</strong> will be able to snatch one GOTY crown away from one of video game's most winningest titles in the history of the medium.</p>
