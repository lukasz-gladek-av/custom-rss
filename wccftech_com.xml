			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-to-counter-strike-classic-offensive-mod-team-after-previously-giving-approval-shutting-down-8-years-of-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve has issued a cease and desist order to the team behind the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mod, Classic Offensive, after having previously approved the mod 8 years prior.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement published to the mod team's official <a href="https://x.com/csco_dev/status/1920189873488642332">X</a> account, the Classic Offensive team warns mod creators that they "<em>should reconsider how they see Valve: a company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.</em>"</p>
<p>Valve gave the project the green light in 2017, according to a <a href="https://classic-offensive.net/#/timeline">timeline</a> the Classic Offensive mod team has created on their website. After years of little to no communication from Valve, in January 2025, the Classic Offensive app was rejected by Valve with the only explanation being "<em>we found that your app is not a good fit for Steam</em>."</p>
<p>After that, the team worked to try and find out what Valve meant by Classic Offensive not being a good fit, reaching out to Valve to no avail. The cease and desist order came through just hours before the team intended to update the mod through ModDB.</p>
<p>"<em>As we prepared to update via ModDB instead,</em>" the Classic Offensive team's statement reads, "<em>we received a cease and desist notification from Valve's socials just hours before launch. In follow-up communications, they clarified that releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on their intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The statement goes on to call out the narrowing conditions for what mods based on Valve's games are allowed and how, in the view of the Classic Offensive team, the company's current interpretations of what's allowed go against the culture around modding that Valve has benefited from for years and Valve's approval of the project in 2017.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for the mod team and those who were looking forward to Classic Offensive that Valve has seemingly changed its mind about what it wants to allow at the last minute, and it also puts into question other mods, particularly the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cs-legacy-a-fan-made-standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-is-in-the-works/">CS: GO Legacy project</a>.</p>

			<p>The Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes that can be downloaded online don't bring any significant improvement, a recent analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at some of the mods available for the remaster of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, starting with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion BSA Uncompressor</a>. The mod, which showed promise because it eliminated a CPU task, was developed for the original Oblivion, but it also works in the remaster, as it ships with the original Oblivion assets. The installation procedure isn't very simple, requiring the user to manually uncompress files as well, but the efforts should be worth it, as it's been claimed it does improve performance.</p>
<p>However, all the effort required to install this mod isn't really worth it for Oblivion Remastered. In their test, Digital Foundry highlighted how, while there's a minimal variance at the beginning of a session, the differences eventually become equal. The difference between the five-minute-long benchmark runs set around the Imperial City was less than 2%, and it doesn't eliminate the issue, as it doesn't address the variance that makes the experience feel choppy.</p>
<p>Besides checking out if the Oblivion BSA Uncompressor indeed solves stuttering issues in Oblivion Remastered, the tech experts also looked at the many engine configuration tweaked files that are usually shared after an Unreal Engine game launches. Looking at the most popular tweaked engine configuration file available from Nexus Mods, the tech experts highlighted how many of the changes don't actually mean anything for a shipped game, such as turning off logging, and how the tweaked file effectly does nothing for performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Do Oblivion Remastered PC Anti-Stutter Fixes Do Anything?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSQ5T32d3Lo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes not really doing anything, it will be up to Virtuos to fix the game's performance, which is one of the biggest issues of the remaster.
