			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has just <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1865395948362293652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised</a> fans with the reveal of Fortnite Ballistic, an upcoming 5v5 tactical first-person competitive game mode launching next week on the popular Battle Royale game. Due to debut in early access on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will release with a single map (Skyline 10), a starting set of weapons and a limited number of items. Epic plans to add more content and make changes based on player's feedback post-launch.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a Fortnite Ballistic match, players are divided into attackers and defenders, like in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, for example. Before the start, they can choose one of five Flex Gadgets to use during the match. Attackers have the goal of planting a reality-shattering Rift Point Device at one of two locations on the map, while defenders must foil their plan at all costs. A round is over when the Rift Point Device explodes or one of the teams is completely eliminated. After six rounds, players switch sides. The session ends when one team has won a total of 7 rounds.</p>
<p>In Fortnite Ballistic, players can buy their chosen gadget and keep two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory each round. These cannot be dropped or picked up by other players. When used correctly, Flex Gadgets can make a difference in the outcome of a round. A few examples: plant booby traps with the Proximity Mine, shield the team with the Bubble Shield, mark nearby enemies with the Recon Grenade, and flush out foes with the Frag Grenade or Impulse Grenade.</p>
<p>From the get-go, players will get to pick between Unranked and Ranked matches. The former option offers a more casual experience and provides backfill for players who drop out of matches. Ranked play, on the other hand, is for those who want to test their skills against other players in a competitive environment where the winning team gains rank and the losing team loses rank. Moreover, Ranked matches are not backfilled. Players who leave ranked matches will receive a rank penalty and will not be able to join another match for a period of time. Matchmaking in Ranked Fortnite Ballistic will be based on a party's average rank.</p>
<p>What do you think about this new mode? Does it interest you, or will you stick to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-rumored-to-return-permanently-starting-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanently returned Fortnite OG</a>?</p>
