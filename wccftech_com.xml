			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/">Xbox handheld </a>has been canceled over AMD's high minimum order requirements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumors originated from the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-we-are-actively-investing-in-our-future-first-party-consoles-and-devices-designed-engineered-and-built-by-xbox.1688818/page-4#post-270871817">NeoGAF forums</a>, where known AMD leaker Kepler L2, who accurately provided information multiple times in the past regarding AMD products, including consoles, said that, as far as they know, the handheld was canceled because AMD wanted a commitment of over 10 million units to justify the R&amp;D required to make a dedicated SoC for the console. However, with the Steam Deck selling around 5 million units, and the ASUS ROG only selling no more than 2 million units, Microsoft didn't want to take the risk.</p>



<p>Despite Kepler L2's excellent track record, we have to take the real reason behind the cancellation of the Xbox handheld with a grain of salt. As the system was never officially announced, Microsoft will unlikely release an official statement on it. However, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-might-go-full-third-party-leaving-hardware-for-good-rumor/">the company's strategy seemingly shifting more towards becoming a third-party publisher</a>, it's quite possible it didn't want to commit to producing so many units for a system that may not have been a massive seller.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox handheld was never formally announced, there was no doubt that a portable system has been in the works at some point, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/">execs teasing it multiple times in the past</a>. The system would have been part of the company's handheld strategy, which is now going to be centered around the ROG Xbox Ally launching later this month. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">its relatively high price</a>, the handheld system is proving to be quite popular, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-already-selling-out-across-the-globe/"> it's already sold out almost everywhere</a> before its launch set for October 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KOEI TECMO's Team Ninja is about to launch NINJA GAIDEN 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be available on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), but their work doesn't stop there, given that there is a DLC titled 'The Two Masters' due to be released early next year.</p>



<p>Game Director Masakazu Hirayama talked about this DLC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGrGeUYAeA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which was recorded at Tokyo Game Show 2025. </p>



<p><em>The Two Masters DLC, which will be available in early 2026, contains new weapons for Yakumo and Ryu. You can see from the key visual that Yakumo's new weapon captures his personality and his approach to combat with his expressive abilities. Whereas Ryu’s weapon has a more precise look to it and will allow you to perform powerful and high-speed abilities. Each of these weapons will have its own distinct qualities and a plethora of mechanics for NINJA GAIDEN 4 players to dig into. So, we invite players to look forward to it.<br>In addition to these weapons, there's also going to be new story content included in the Two Masters DLC, and the story content takes place after the events of the base game and unfolds from the perspective of both of these characters. In addition to the story content, there will also be post-game challenge content that exists separately from the Ninja Trials that are in the base game. So there is a lot of content for players to dig into.</em></p>



<p>The Two Masters DLC can be accessed by purchasing NINJA GAIDEN 4 Deluxe Edition or the Deluxe Edition Upgrade. The Deluxe Edition costs $20 more than the base edition.</p>



<p>The base game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last between 15 and 20 hours</a>, but the DLC will undoubtedly increase the time players can spend in the action game. Team Ninja did not quantify by how much, though.</p>
