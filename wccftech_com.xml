			<p>Although very little is known about <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a></em></strong> other than that it is in the works and it is coming out at some point, the community is obviously excited about the next entry in the series. However, as it's already been almost 15 years since the launch of the celebrated <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, expectations are incredibly high, so much so that they have put the game in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, according to a former Bethesda employee.</p>



<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview">Esports Insider</a></strong>, former <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Lead Artist&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile</strong>,&nbsp;who worked on&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;76,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skyrim</em>, commented on the next entry in the series and the challenges it is already facing during development. Expectations for both the game and Fallout 5 (which is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/">unlikely to return to the series' roots</a></strong>, according to Fallout New Vegas lead developer Chris Avellone) are very high, and Purkeypile believes they have put both games in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, alongside Skyrim being widely considered as one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p><em>"How do you beat that?"</em> he said. <em>"And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone,"</em> <strong>Purkeypile</strong> continued.</p>



<p>The massive fan expectations are putting major pressure on <strong><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong>, and, according to <strong>Purkeypile</strong>, <strong>Bethesda</strong> will take all the time needed to deliver the best possible game. <em>"I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls VI out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that,"</em> the former <strong>Bethesda</strong> lead artist elaborated.</p>



<p>The long time it's taking for the game to launch, however, has nothing to do with waiting to see <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em>'s</strong> reception. <em>"I’m sure there’s plenty of audience overlap and all, but just because one game flops doesn’t mean another will necessarily. There can be a whole bunch of reasons that happen."</em></p>



<p>Although a slightly different game, there's no denying that the reception <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> received when it launched in 2023</strong></a>, which hasn't really improved over time with the release of free updates and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a></strong>, could definitely be putting more pressure on the development team to deliver the best possible RPG, and the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"ultimate fantasy simulator"</strong></a></em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard</strong> himself teased last year.</p>

			<p>Just two days before the end of 2025, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had sold its digital video game distribution platform <strong>GOG</strong></a> (formerly <strong>Good Old Games</strong>) to <strong>Michał Kiciński</strong>, who had co-founded the company (and CD Projekt RED itself), for $25 million.</p>



<p>Now, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published an interview with Kiciński</a>, who had retired after leaving CD Projekt RED on the very day that the company shared the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Cyberpunk 2077 teaser trailer</a>, on January 10, 2013. After several years out of the gaming industry, Kiciński appears eager to dive back in and is unafraid of the proverbial elephant in the room: <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just surpassed a new user concurrency record this past Sunday</a>. </p>



<p><em>I see opportunities more than negatives, that's my nature, and I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow. And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80% of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me, it's the opposite. I see: 'Oh, there is one big competitor, it'll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80%, so it should be easier to take the market from them.' GOG has its own strengths and really should focus on maintaining them and even strengthening them. There is no need to try to be like the others. GOG has its own identity and its own uniqueness, which is very much appreciated by gamers.</em> <em>Steam is winning with its ease of use. In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general.</em></p>



<p>In any case, Kiciński <strong>clarified that he does not plan to directly challenge Steam on triple-A game offerings</strong>, as Epic Games Store did, instead favoring deals with smaller developers and publishers. However, the platform <strong>will continue to sell CD Projekt RED's games at a rate favorable for the Polish developer</strong>, so fans who'd like to support CDPR should still pick GOG over other platforms if they want more of their money to go directly toward the studio.</p>
