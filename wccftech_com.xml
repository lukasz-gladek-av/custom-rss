			<p>Studio Wildcard's latest ARK: Survival Ascended expansion, Lost Colony, is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S players, as the latest expansion closes the gap between the stories of the previous Extinction expansion and the upcoming ARK 2, while adding a host of new creatures, seven new biomes, and more.</p>



<p>Lost Colony takes players to Arat Prime, where humanity made its final stand. You'll begin your journey in the Necrocene, a post-cataclysmic era that has plunged the entire southern pole of the Earth into darkness. It's here, beneath the snow, the ice, and under the shroud of night, where the Lost Colony continues to survive below its energy shields. </p>



<p>Energy shields that are powered by radioactive Red Element, which is also the source of what's keeping the Earth a broken planet. Which is how the Lost King wants to keep, to maintain his rule. It's then your choice to go the way of the lost king and succumb to his tyranny, or try to oppose him and hold on to your humanity.</p>

<p>The release of this expansion rounds out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3720100/ARK_Lost_Colony_Expansion_Pass/">Lost Colony expansion pass</a> that Studio Wildcard announced and kicked off earlier this year, which was also when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/">received a major graphical update across consoles and PC</a>, including improvements that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">took advantage of PlayStation's PSSR and PS5 Pro</a>.</p>



<p>Across the seven new biomes introduced, you'll experience the overwhelming and oppressive metropolis of the Lost King's domain, the arctic perimeter of the Tundra, the bioluminescent flowers and fauna of the Twilight Forest that's far more dangerous than it looks, the eerie Dark Forest that leads to even more dangers beyond what lurks in its woods. </p>



<p>There's also the Caldera, a volcanic crater with a massive sacred ring dedicated to the Lost King, hot springs which you'll find across the map in different concentrations, and aberrant crash sites where you'll have to avoid toxic sludge. So, cheery places all in all.</p>



<p>Across these new biomes you'll find 13 new creatures, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veilwyn</li>



<li>Solwyn</li>



<li>Malwyn</li>



<li>Ossidon</li>



<li>Gloon</li>



<li>Desmodus</li>



<li>Cryolophosaurus</li>



<li>Gigadesmodus</li>



<li>Aureliax</li>



<li>Thralls</li>



<li>Gargoyles</li>



<li>Neophytes</li>



<li>Revenants</li>
</ul>



<p>It's a fairly sizable expansion for ARK players to dig into while they wait for ARK 2, which doesn't seem to be arriving anytime soon. In fact, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">confirmed today</a> that it won't be arriving until 2028, with an expansion in 2027 giving players their first taste of what the sequel will be like.</p>

			<p>Three Fields Entertainment, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">founded by former Burnout developers</a> who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">released the open-world sandbox racer</a> Wreckreation, a game where you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">edit your race track and the world around you with a press of a button</a>, has launched a Patreon page to help keep the studio alive.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">launch this past October</a> was a commercial disappointment for Three Fields Entertainment, with players criticizing the myriad of technical issues and a lack of content at launch. It was so poor that a little over a month after launch, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">announced via a LinkedIn post that the entire studio's staff had been put on redundancy notice</a>, meaning they could all be laid off if things didn't improve.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark</em>," Sperry wrote in her post at the top of December. "<em></em><em>We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form.</em>"</p>



<p>That hasn't happened as of yet, but what has happened is that Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/u10680381">has launched a Patreon page to try to keep the studio alive</a>. The studio announced the Patreon page with <a href="https://x.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, which it says was created as a response to players who asked how they could support the studio.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing the Three Fields Entertainment Patreon‼️</p><p>Following our post on December 4th so many of you have asked how you can support us and we’re pleased to announce that we now have a direct way to do that! We have four tiers to choose from, with various rewards for each. More… <a href="https://t.co/3m0PfxrVTo">pic.twitter.com/3m0PfxrVTo</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Patreon helps us keep our 10 person development team together and continue updating Wreckreation with the speed and responsiveness you've already seen</em>," the Patreon page reads, "<em>and we're doing this now because the next few months are crucial</em>."</p>



<p>The Patreon page continues to be, seemingly, very transparent about the realities that Three Fields is facing. The studio estimates it needs about $65,000 a month to keep the team together and the studio alive. It's currently looking for additional funding by trying to find new partners and pitching new projects, but we've seen studios shut down or, at the very least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/">incur serious layoffs</a> while they look for funding from a new partner.</p>



<p>It's a difficult time <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">across the video games industry</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/keybanc-we-believe-intel-has-won-the-gpu-gaming-socket-for-the-nintendo-switch-3-on-18a-and-amd-faces-increasing-risks-from-a-price-war-with-intel/">across the tech industry overall</a>, with layoffs, studio shut-downs, and the constant concern of both happening hanging over the heads of developers. Hopefully, Three Fields Entertainment's story ends differently than how it ends for the majority of teams.</p>
