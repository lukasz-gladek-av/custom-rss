			<p>Today, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of increasingly intense rumors and leaks</a>, Bethesda has finally unveiled The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Bethesda's Todd Howard explained what the original game meant when it launched in 2006 and then introduced a series of developers who discussed the improvements of the new version, which are rather extensive.</p>
<p>The game's visuals runs on the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, which gives it a massively improved look over the original, but the underlying logic still runs on the Gamebryo engine. However, there have been improvements in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>HUD, menu, and map reworks</li>
<li>Improved UI for systems like Persuasion, Clairvoyance, and more</li>
<li>Modifications to levelling, encumbrance, non-combat perks, and other mechanics</li>
<li>Improved enemy scaling</li>
<li>Enhanced accessibility features</li>
<li>Additional autosaves</li>
<li>Revised first-person and third-person camera</li>
<li>Improved combat feedback and controller support</li>
</ul>

<p>To top it all off came the confirmation that, as rumored, the game is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It's also on Game Pass, as you'd expect from a Bethesda game. If you're not a subscriber, you can purchase the regular edition for $49.99 or the Deluxe Edition for $59.99, which comes with some new content, specifically new quests for unique Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon armors, weapons, and horse armor sets, as well as the following DLCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter’s Stronghold expansion</li>
<li>Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair</li>
<li>Mehrune’s Razor</li>
<li>The Thieves Den</li>
<li>Wizard’s Tower</li>
<li>Orrery</li>
<li>Horse Pack Armor</li>
</ul>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Deluxe Edition also comes with the two big original expansions, Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles, both of which are quite large (especially the latter). Last but not least, you can find the official PC system requirements below. The game's size is around 120GB, again <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming the earlier leak</a>.</p>

			<p>Six games added support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-steel-seed/">announced</a>. The complete list includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-will-be-available-in-steel-seed/">Steel Seed</a>, which launched with support for DLSS 4 Mult-Frame Generation, Tempest Rising, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a>, RuneScape: Dragonwilds, Commandos: Origins, and the upcoming title Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur and Commandos: Origins will launch with support for DLSS Super Resolution, while support will be added to Tempest Rising, The Talos Principle: Reawakened, and Runescape: Dragonwilds. Those titles will also add support for NVIDIA's DLSS Frame Generation.</p>
<p>While GeForce RTX 50 Series owners will be the ones able to take advantage of all the features within NVIDIA's DLSS advances, so long as you have a graphics card with performance to spare, you can enable DLAA on The Talos Principle: Reawakened, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and RuneScape: Dragonwilds.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur is launching later this week, but Steel Seed arrived today on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. Developed by Storm in a Teacup, Steel Seed is an action-adventure game that already looks incredible, and will be able to run even better if you're able to utilize all the features confirmed today from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>In our review of Steel Seed, which was played on PC, we said,</p>
<p>"<em>Steel Seed is not going to win any awards for innovation, but a game doesn't always need to be innovative to be engaging. While the vast majority of the game's core features have already been seen, when put together, they deliver a solid experience that fans of games like Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series will surely enjoy. Just don't expect to find deep combat, character customization, or anything too advanced: the game is all about Zoe's journey into the mysterious world she finds herself thrown into, and every game mechanic is at the service of this story, for better or worse.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Universal has reportedly partnered with director Michael Bay and actress Sydney Sweeney to develop a film adaptation of SEGA's 1980s-era Out Run.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, Bay will direct the film while Sweeney has signed on to produce the movie, with Jayson Rothwell to write the script. Bay will also be a producer on the film with his partner Brad Fuller, and while there's the chance that Sweeney could act in the film, she's currently only on board as a producer.</p>
<p>When SEGA first launched Out Run in arcades in 1986, it was an instant hit and spawned several sequels both within and outside of arcades. The most recent Out Run game came to 3DS in 2014 with 3D OutRun, which makes it a little over a decade since the racer has returned in any meaningful fashion.</p>
<p>Popular as Out Run was for many years, Universal has gone with a bit of a deep cut here in a way that feels intentional. Out Run might not be the first thing players would think of as the next video game series that should be adapted into a movie or TV show, but that might be why it was chosen.</p>
<p>Universal could have made what it felt was a reasonable deal to add another video game adaptation to its portfolio, and at the same time, SEGA gets another chance to revitalize one of its older series.</p>
<p>Adding Michael Bay and current star Sydney Sweeney then adds some weight behind the film to hopefully make it a box-office smash, similar to how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-surpassed-200-million-at-the-box-office/">Sonic</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-already-seeing-increased-sales-of-merchandise-and-games-thanks-to-the-super-mario-bros-movie/">Super Mario Bros</a>., and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft</a> movies have all been big commercial hits.</p>
<p>However, the key difference between Out Run and the rest of those series is that so many of the kids who drove their parents to see all those other films have at least heard of, if not played games from, those other series. The number of kids who have never heard of Out Run only grows the further away from 2014 we get.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the chance that Universal's marketing team, paired with a solid premise for the film, could whip up plenty of excitement around an adaptation of the classic racing series and make it a box-office hit. But that remains to be seen.</p>
