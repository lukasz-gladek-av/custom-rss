			<p>While <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">1,200 Ubisoft employees</a></strong> are on strike this week in response to the company's recent "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>," yet another piece of evidence regarding the heavily rumoured <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> remaster has appeared online. Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=04knYK8dAZ2TRI8dBP6GJEH">Amazon UK listing</a> for an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered art book is up and available for pre-orders. It also, interestingly, has a <strong>March 24, 2026, release date</strong> attached to it.</p>



<p>What makes the art book seem legit, beyond the fact that Ubisoft is listed as the book's author, is that <strong>Titan</strong>, the publisher behind <a href="https://titanbooks.com/catalog/?q=assassin%27s%20creed&amp;page=1">several Assassin's Creed artbooks</a>, is also listed as the publisher for this upcoming book. The book is listed at <strong>£39.99 RRP</strong>, though if it is real, you can grab it on sale right now for <strong>£29.95</strong>.</p>



<p>Assuming this is a legitimate listing, firstly, the release date listed for the art book <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">does line up with what we've previously heard</a> about when the rumoured remaster is set to release. Secondly, the fact that this listing has even appeared lines up with what we heard earlier this week about the coming remaster, which is that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">are due for a reveal in the near future</a> (though not at tonight's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, reportedly).</p>



<p>One interesting thing to note about this art book, however, is that according to a <strong>PEGI rating</strong> spotted back in December 2025, the remaster is officially titled <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a></strong>. Again, if the art book is real, this could just be a placeholder title for the listing, or even just a mistake on the part of whoever inputted the information for the listing.</p>



<p>We've seen several reports and rumours about this upcoming remaster/remake for years now. It's arguably one of the worst-kept secrets in the video game industry, and yet, we've had nothing official from Ubisoft. The French company had no problem <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">threatening the actor who played Black Flag protagonist <strong>Edward Kenway</strong> with a lawsuit</a> for even slightly suggesting the remaster was coming soon, but as of yet, it won't confirm one way or another if the remaster/remake is even happening.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear something sooner rather than later, so we can put this run of rumours and reports to rest and focus on what's actually coming down the pipeline.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> was a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">standout reveal</strong> during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event</strong></a>, though its continued absence from the spotlight has led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">speculation regarding its launch timeline</strong>. Despite the title not appearing during this month's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, the project <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains on track to release before the end of the year.</strong></p>



<p>Kadokawa, FromSoftware's parent company, reiterated this window today in its <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Q3 fiscal year earnings report</strong></a>, confirming a generic <strong>2026</strong> schedule for the title.</p>



<p> In the report, Kadokawa also addressed the game's platform status, stating it will<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2".</em> While this confirms exclusivity for now, it likely refers to the game’s status at launch. Given the broader industry trend of moving away from permanent console exclusives, it would be <strong>a significant shift</strong> if <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> did not eventually see a PC release, at the very least.</p>



<p>The high level of anticipation surrounding <em>The Duskbloods</em> is understandable, especially following how <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em></strong> evolved the studio's formula with its roguelike-meets-soulslike co-op mechanics in 2025.</p>



<p>Reports suggest that <em>The Duskbloods</em> will take things a step further. The game has been in development since before <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>'s marketing began, making it <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">one of the studio's longest development cycles</a></strong> to date, and focuses on innovative gameplay features the studio is reportedly very proud of. As such, players are eager to see the game and these systems in action. Hopefully, it will be soon.</p>
