			<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>, the mistake you may make is treating the Samurai and Ninja styles as a binary choice, picking whichever you feel is best in each situation. And you wouldn't be terribly wrong: both styles are perfectly viable on their own and there is no direct penalty for staying in one all the time.</p>



<p>However, if you do that, you are limiting your potential. Switching between the two styles is the essential "next step" in the combat dance that the <em>Nioh</em> series has always championed. </p>



<p>Welcome to the Dojo. In this guide, we will go over some of the game's central combat mechanics, such as Arts Proficiency, and how they come together to dictate a very unique combat flow.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-why-ki-damage-matters" data-level="2">Why Ki Damage Matters</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-challenge-of-style-differences" data-level="2">The Challenge of Style Differences</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency" data-level="2">The Power of Arts Proficiency</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled" data-level="2">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-why-ki-damage-matters">Why Ki Damage Matters</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Ki-Damage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The key to combat in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> remains the same as in previous entries: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">depleting enemy Ki</strong>. By doing so, you gain a massive advantage over enemies, no matter their type.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human Enemies:</strong> Once their Ki is gone, they are open to grapple attacks.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai:</strong> Lowering their Ki allows you to stagger them with any attack, and reducing their Max Ki opens them up to a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Blow</strong> for massive damage.</li>
</ul>



<p>While you can mostly ignore these mechanics for the majority of regular enemies during your first playthrough, dealing Ki damage is non-negotiable for bosses. It is the only way to deal high damage without them constantly retaliating and interrupting you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge-of-style-differences">The Challenge of Style Differences</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Styles-2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, depleting Ki has become slightly more challenging. Samurai Style attacks are generally slower than in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, and the primary Ki-destroying weapon, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tonfa</strong>, now exclusive to the Ninja Style.</p>



<p>Because of the sheer attack speed, the Ninja Style is naturally better at chipping away an enemy's Ki through a constant barrage of strikes, regardless of the equipped weapons. This quick pace serves a second purpose as well: building <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arts Proficiency</strong> much faster.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency">The Power of Arts Proficiency</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Arts-Proficiency-Full-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arts Proficiency is the mechanic in Nioh 3 that allows you to deal boss-melting damage, not counting Living Artifact, which can still take advantage of it to utterly annihilate most enemies. </p>



<p>As you attack in either style, you fill the Arts Proficiency gauge. Once filled, your next Martial Art or Heavy Attack is significantly powered up. In addition, the more different attacks you chain together while the gauge is active, the more powerful each one becomes.</p>



<p>At this point, you can easily understand how Ki depletion and Arts Proficiency in Ninja Style start building a basic combat flow. If a Yokai isn't out of Ki, it isn't staggered by your combo, and they can and will interrupt you. Unless you equip the  Oprresive Strength Samurai skill, but that opens up a survivability problem that can only be solved with advanced builds providing automatic healing by landing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Flow-Distilled-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With all the above in mind, the basic Nioh 3 combat loop can be distilled as such:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Pressure With Ninja Style:</strong> Start the fight in Ninja Style to deplete the enemy's Ki and rapidly build your Arts Proficiency gauge.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Deal Damage With Samurai Sty</strong>le<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Once the enemy's Ki is depleted (and they are staggered), switch to Samurai Style to unleash your high-damage Strong Attacks and Martial Arts combos.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Recovery:</strong> As your assault ends, switch back to Ninja Style after using Ki Pulse to shorten your recovery time. This allows you to recover Ki more quickly, and use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu </strong>(whose charges should be full following your Samurai Style combo) to deal burst damage from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you progress and gain a deeper understanding of these mechanics, you won’t need such a rigid structure. You'll find yourself switching styles instinctively based on the rhythm of the duel. However, for those first few hours in the Warring States, this loop is highly recommended to help you mow down Yokai and build the confidence required to become the next Shogun.</p>

<p>To avoid <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">overwhelming players</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> introduces mechanics gradually, perhaps a little too slowly. For the Samurai Style, the flow of combat is entirely centered on switching between <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Low, Mid, and High stances, </strong>which is something you cannot take advantage of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">as only Mid stance is available from the beginning of the game</strong>.</p>



<p>As such, the first few enemies of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Warring States</strong> starting map feel more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">challenging than they should</strong>.

<p>Furthermore, you should also learn <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Deflect as soon as possible.</strong>.

This <strong>increases</strong> the power of your Martial Arts and Heavy Attacks.</p>



<p>If the complexity of the Samurai stances feels like too much at the start, don't be afraid to lean on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>. It deals less raw damage but offers a simplified basic moveset and superior agility that works against almost every enemy type while you learn the ropes.</p>

<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ki Pulse</strong> remains the most important mechanic in the franchise.

<p>Watch the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">light particles</strong> surrounding Takechiyo, as they indicate the perfect window. While a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Ki Pulse</strong> (timed to the last possible second) is the goal, don't stress about perfection early on. Just get used to the "hit-and-pulse" rhythm that defines the <em>Nioh</em> series combat.</p>



<p>As you get more used to Ki Pulsing, you will be able to take advantage of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flux</strong> ability (1 Samurai skill point in the Samurai Skill tree).

<p>In <em>Nioh 3</em>, however, the introduction of <strong>Ninja</strong> style made <strong>dodging a valuable defensive option</strong>, more than in its predecessors, with an <strong>increased distance</strong> and the ability to dodge quickly after attacking with <strong>Mist</strong>, the Ninja style equivalent of <strong>Ki Pulse</strong> (but without Ki restoration!).</p>



<p>At the start of the game, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mastering the nuances of both styles can be a challenge</strong>.

<p>However, <strong>don't overdo it.</strong> If you clear every single icon before moving the story forward, you risk out-leveling the content and stripping away the challenge.</p>



<p>Play naturally and follow what interests you rather than chasing every waymarker. Remember that in a Team NINJA game, <strong>the first playthrough is essentially the tutorial</strong>, so you’ll have plenty of time to explore every inch of the map once the real game begins in the higher difficulty unlocked after completing the game for the first time.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Nioh 3</strong></em> is the first new entry in the hardcore action role-playing game series by Team NINJA in over 6 years, and a lot has changed since the second entry.</p>



<p>While the <strong>basic combat mechanics and loot system are rooted in the franchise's history</strong>, the third entry introduces <strong>many changes and additions</strong> that can leave even veterans a little confused.</p>



<p>In this&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Complete Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong>, you will find everything you need not only to successfully complete your journey through time but also to have tons of fun while doing so, starting from the <strong>Warring States period</strong>, which can be experienced in the massive <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/">free demo</a></strong> available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<h2 id="h-overview">Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260118012947_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 feels both fresh and familiar</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hardcore action role-playing game</strong> where players control Takeichiyo Tokugawa (who can be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully customized</strong> at the beginning of the game via a deep character creator) as they journey through time to <strong>seek and defeat their treacherous brother Kunimatsu</strong>, who has unleashed Yokai in the land and is using the fabled Spirit Stones to become the shogun in place of his sibling.</p>



<p><span>Besides featuring another story which sees the appearances of real-history figures like Ieyasu Tokugawa,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features a&nbsp;<strong>combination of old and new mechanics</strong></span>&nbsp;that enhance the series' challenging experience, but that may take <strong>some time to get used to</strong>, especially if you're coming straight from previous entries in the series.</p>



<p id="h-if-you-re-feeling-lost-in-this-sprawling-adventure-our-essential-tips-guide-will-help-you-come-to-grips-with-the-most-important-mechanics-in-the-game-and-start-having-fun-right-from-the-get-go">If you're feeling lost in this sprawling adventure, our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-5-essential-tips-to-learn-nioh-3/">Essential Tips guide</a></strong> will help you come to grips with the most important mechanics in the game and <strong>start having fun right from the get-go.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-story-progression">Story Progression</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-cutscene-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>In Nioh 3, you will meet a lot of characters, including real historical figures</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike previous entries in the series, which had players pick missions from several regional maps, <em>Nioh 3</em> features <strong>multiple open-field maps</strong> that let you explore different locations and reach the <strong>main mission locations</strong> directly while engaging in plenty of side content.</p>



<p>At end of these, which play like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">classic closed-off missions</strong> from previous entries in the series, you will have to defeat the <strong>fearsome bosses</strong> to destroy the <strong>Crucible</strong> and progress the story. This will unlock <strong>new regions of the open-field maps and brand-new maps.</strong></p>



<p>Even before the first Warring States period map opens up, you will have to contend with <strong>powerful bosses</strong> that can be frustrating to take down. This is the case of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/warrior-of-the-east-how-to-beat-yamagata-masakage-in-nioh-3">Yamagata Masakage</a></strong>, who will bar your way as you make your way through Yokai at the start of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-combat">Combat</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 significantly evolves the series' combat system</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most significant change to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>'s combat system, aside from the ability to jump and briefly engage in aerial combat, is the introduction of two fighting styles: <strong>Samurai and Ninja.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Samurai Style</strong> plays like the characters from the first two entries in the series, allowing players to wield select weapons in <strong>three different stances</strong> and unleash powerful <strong>Martial Arts,</strong> which can be enhanced with the <strong>Arts Proficiency</strong> system.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>, on the other hand, is a faster combat style that can use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu skills</strong> to disrupt enemies, deal elemental damage, and avoid enemy attacks with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">superior agility.</strong></p>



<p>Both fighting styles can also be further empowered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Guardian Spirits</strong>, which grant access to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">two</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">elemental skills</strong> each that replace the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Yokai Skills</strong> from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em> and the powered-up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Living Artifact</strong> state, which replaces Living Weapon from the original <em>Nioh</em> and Yokai Shift from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>.</p>



<p>In case you are feeling <strong>confused</strong> about the <em>Nioh 3</em> <strong>combat flow</strong> amidst Samurai Style with its three stances and Ninja Style, you are not alone. <span>T</span>o learn the basics of this flow and how Arts Proficiency and Ninjustsu tie the two styles together, check out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">Mastering Nioh 3 Combat and Arts Proficiency Flow guide.</a></strong></p>

<p>Likewise, returning from its predecessors are <strong>multiple Skill Trees</strong> for the Samurai and Ninja Styles and all weapons, which can be used to unlock the <strong>Martial Arts</strong> that define each weapon and style.</p>



<p>New to the <em>Nioh</em> series are <strong>Skills and the Skill Points </strong>required to activate them. Learned by completing specific tasks, these skills <strong>empower</strong> both the Samurai and Ninja Style and provide bonuses for both.</p>



<p>Rounding up the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression mechanics are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores</strong>. Dropped by Yokai, these can be set in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Onmyo Box</strong> at the Shrine in either Yin or Yang position to get access to either <strong>Onmyo magic spells</strong> or the <strong>ability to summon Yokai</strong> to unleash their signature attacks.</p>

<p>Doing away with the classic linear design of the previous entries in the series, <em>Nioh 3</em> introduces <strong>open fields</strong> that replace the top-down maps of its predecessors. These maps are filled with <strong>side content</strong> to complete, including the Myth sidequests, formidable enemies, Crucible Wraiths and tons of treasure.</p>



<p>While traversal is always conducted on foot, you will unlock <strong>new traversal skills</strong> as more Guardian Spirits join you. They will also provide you with the power needed to unlock new areas and take advantage of the <strong>Spirit Veins</strong> to reach previously inaccessible areas.</p>

<p>The <strong>Diablo-style loot system</strong> returns in <em>Nioh 3.</em> By exploring the open fields and defeating both humans and Yokai, you will be able to find all <strong>sorts of loot</strong> ranging from Samurai and Ninja weapons to helmets, armor, gauntlets, graves, and accessories, coming in <strong>four rarity levels</strong> which determine how many passive skills they grant once equipped.</p>



<p>After reaching a certain point in the story, you will also unlock the <strong>Blacksmith</strong>, who will forge you weapons depending on the Smithing Texts you have found and customize them in different ways.</p>

<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> features the same <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online multiplayer features</strong> as its predecessor. Besides allowing for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">asymmetrical multiplayer</strong> by interacting with the red and blue player graves, allowing you to fight their characters and receive assistance, the game also features <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">co-op multiplayer</strong> which allows you to either join another player seeking help or allowing others to join you. </p>



<p>The asymmetrical mechanics have been further expanded in <em>Nioh 3</em> by introducing the <strong>Bloodedge Demon</strong>, a malignant Yokai that gathers the spirits of defeated Revenants appearing in different places all over the open-field maps.</p>
