			<p>Following the good news that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> one million units sold (not counting all Game Pass users who are playing the game), the Ukrainian development team has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> the main fixes that will be released with the first post-launch update. The game is rather buggy and unbalanced, so, understandably, they will focus on these areas first.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Crash Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issues and memory allocation failures, which previously caused the game to exit unexpectedly, particularly around rendering, skeletal meshes, and quest-related cutscenes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Main Quest Progression Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Several bugs blocking the main quest progression, NPCs getting stuck in objects, incorrect quest markers, and issues with quest cutscenes.</em><br>
<em>Revision of the main quests (like Visions of Truth or A Minor Incident) to ensure smooth transitions, avoiding rare cases of players not being able to proceed further.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Gameplay &amp; Balance Adjustments, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Fixing the price of the weapons with upgrades installed compared to their value without attachments.</em><br>
<em>NPCs behavior, including the way they act when lacking a shelter during the Emissions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cutscenes &amp; Visual Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Rarely missing facial animations, misplaced NPCs, and visual inconsistencies like detached heads and clothes clipping.</em><br>
<em>Quality and stability improvements of the visual effects.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Softlock Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issue where players were unable to close the trade screen after putting ammo in a wrong slot while playing on a gamepad.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>User Interface Improvements, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Quest notifications now showed correctly during dialogues.</em><br>
<em>Corrected texts and missing interaction prompts.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Noted to be addressed in future updates:</strong></em><br>
<em>Analogue sticks dead zones bugfixes.</em><br>
<em>A-Life system bugfixes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my take</a> on STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl:</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>

			<p>Modder HalkHogan has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-nextgen-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a>, the final version of his texture overhaul for CD Projekt RED's next-gen version of the open world RPG masterpiece. According to HalkHogan, though, the improvement is far more extensive than just a texture upscale.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is a project created from the heart that improves and reworks a huge amount of game assets (textures, models, materials and more), and the number of these changes can be counted in thousands. Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent, and as faithful as possible, reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of The Witcher. Now you can experience the most beautiful adventure yet with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ultra quality detailed lore-friendly textures (many of them are reworked to 4K)</em></li>
<li><em>Implemented relief mapping on many surfaces, making them look much more realistic and 3D now</em></li>
<li><em>High quality smooth and more detailed models</em></li>
<li><em>Better object LODs (level of models details from distance) and increased draw distance for many objects</em></li>
<li><em>Specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked assets, that give the objects and surfaces a more realistic look</em></li>
<li><em>Everything consistent with the original CD Projekt RED artistic vision of The Witcher 3</em></li>
</ul>
