			<p>Today, publisher Deep Silver and developer Dambuster Studios have announced that Dead Island 2 has broken through the 20 million player milestone. This comes after the game immediately turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-sales-exceed-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Silver's best-ever launch</a>, with two million units sold in less than two months. Later, the player base expanded even more thanks to the launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Game Pass</a>, and more recently, it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given away for free</a> during the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA Sale. Both promotions inevitably greatly helped inflate the player figures.</p>



<p>Still, today, the publisher-developer duo also confirmed that a new franchise entry is already in development. As teased by the image, it will likely take place elsewhere, abandoning the Los Angeles setting for somewhere else.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was released in April 2023 after a very troubled development. It changed hands not once but twice; the original project was being handled by Yager (Spec Ops: The Line, The Cycle) and was scheduled to launch in Q2 2015. However, that year, Deep Silver announced it had decided to change the development studio. In 2016, that studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/">was confirmed to be Sumo Digital</a>.</p>



<p>That didn't pan out, either. Three and a half years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was put into the hands of the internal team Dambuster Studios</a>. That was just a few months before the pandemic, which would inevitably delay the project (as it did for literally everything) even further. After all this ruckus, Dambuster's game inevitably raised some eyebrows when it approached the launch window. However, it proved everyone wrong by delivering a solid and fun core experience.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated Dead Island 2 7.5 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's latest DLC expansion, Legacy of the Forge, is now out across all platforms, alongside a new patch for the game from Warhorse Studios, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/patch-14">Update 1.4</a>, which includes several quality of life changes, balancing tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>



<p>The DLC's release also came with a new trailer, showcasing a bit more of the new storyline that players will be able to delve and forge their own path into. </p>

<p>The new DLC sees Henry join the Kuttenberg Blacksmith Guild, following in his adoptive father's footsteps by not only taking up smithing, but by attempting to complete what his adoptive father, Martin, could not. Fix the town's broken astronomical clock.</p>



<p>As Henry embarks on the journey to fix the clock and repair his adoptive father's legacy, he brings Martin's colleagues back together to get the job done. Along the way, the forge becomes a new home for players and for Henry, as you're able to decorate and build out your workshop, living quarters, and nearly every inch of the forge to your liking. </p>



<p>The expansion adds at least 15 more hours of game time for players who've rinsed everything else that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to offer. While Update 1.4 adds a few welcomed balance tweaks, like halbreds being "<em>twice as durable</em>" now, and increased quality for the Trollbane hammer.</p>



<p>If you've purchased the Gold Edition of the game or the Expansion Pass, then all you need to do is update Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to start playing the DLC. Otherwise, you'll have to grab it separately for Â£11.49.</p>
