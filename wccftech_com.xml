            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-announces-press-start-event-for-june-12-with-mgs-delta-silent-hill-f-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese game developer and publisher KONAMI announced an upcoming event titled 'Press Start' that will take place on June 12 at 6:00 AM Pacific Time / 9:00 AM Eastern Time / 3:00 PM Central European Time. The live stream will be watchable via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/KONAMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/konami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;KONAMI already said that it will last around 37 minutes. Subtitles will be available in 13 languages.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the studio confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be prominently featured in the broadcast. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Developed in Unreal Engine 5 with the help of Virtuos, the game features modern controls (with the option to stick to legacy controls) and an upgraded battle damage system that reflects the wear and tear to Snake's clothes and the bruises and bullet wounds on his body in real time. These injuries will leave permanent marks on Snake's body, telling the story of each player's unique journey through the game. The game's official PC system requirements are available <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 28.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is a new entry in KONAMI's prized horror franchise. It's being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, a Hong Kong team that previously worked on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Marvel's Avengers, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. During last week's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the game, set in a secluded town in 1960s Japan, will be released on September 25 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>But that's not all we're getting in the Press Start event, as KONAMI teased that 'more' will be shown. Of course, whether that's something significant or perhaps just an update for eFootball remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit has arrived today, thanks to some images that also highlight the differences with the retail unit that finally launched last week.</p>
<p>The new images of the NDK Core Ounce devkit were shared on X earlier today by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendeal</a>, and provide a rather good look at the system. Contrary to the usual, the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit doesn't look that different from the retail, and the only notable differences are the double USB-C ports at the bottom, and the all-black color scheme, which some may prefer to the color schemes used for the launch retail units.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Switch 2 dev kits use some kind of custom cable to connect on the bottom (USB-C and something else? double USB-C?) <a href="https://t.co/LSxefZuwth">pic.twitter.com/LSxefZuwth</a></p>
<p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1931840515156349195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 finally launched worldwide last week, with a few exceptions, alongside a few titles, including Mario Kart World, the highly anticipated new entry in the series, and a selection of third-party ports, which include Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and a few others. While the system is the first one from Nintendo to support features that have become standard since the launch of the original Switch, the implementation sometimes leaves something to be desired. HDR support, for example, is disappointing, especially in handheld mode due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">below-average display.</a> It's not all doom and gloom from a technical perspective, however, as the system seems to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-seems-to-have-native-keyboard-and-mouse-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;natively support mouse and keyboard controls</a>, which can be a game-changer for first-person games or strategy games like Civilization VII, another of the system's launch titles.</p>

			<p>inXile Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> its next big project, the first-person steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution, with a new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. The developers were also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gameplay-interview-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the official Xbox Wire blog, revealing more details about the game. For instance, we learned that multi-person dialogues are very important in Clockwork Revolution, and the game will even include some 'truly evil' options during conversations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo (inXile founder and producer on the game):</strong> It was important for us to speak directly to core roleplaying fans and show what this game really is. We slow things down for a moment, let the conversation breathe, and show the systems at work. That scene with Alfie isn’t just dramatic, it sets the tone. This is a game that can be brutal. Not just in combat, but in the choices you make and how the world responds. It’s not just about cinematics, it’s about the kind of deep, reactive RPG we love to build, and that our players expect.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Chad Moore (game director on Clockwork Revolution and programmer on the steampunk RPG classic Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura):</strong> It also highlights our multi-person conversations. Some conversations will have multiple people involved, and who you choose to speak to can send you down different dialogue branches. This can wildly change where a conversation ends up going. In the case of the trailer, Morgan chose to speak to Errol instead of Alfie, despite obvious warnings, and that resulted in poor Errol’s death. So, if you choose to go down that path, Errol is then a character that won’t be in the rest of the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo:</strong> Conversations have meaningful consequences, and I think it’s worth mentioning we have truly evil conversation options. You see a few of those play out in the trailer. If you’re offering evil options, they need to actually pay off and have meaningful consequences in order for the good choices to feel good. Otherwise, you’re not truly playing the way you want to play.</em></p>
<p>Clockwork Revolution was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase in 2023. At the time, the studio said it was in 'early development'. Now, it's saying that the game will launch in 'due time'. Phil Spencer didn't mention it among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games that will be part of the 2026 Xbox lineup</a>, so there's a chance it might launch even later. So far, the game is only confirmed for PC and Xbox Series S|X, but with Microsoft's new multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually reaches other consoles, too.</p>

			<p><a href="https://press.necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demonschool</a>, the Persona series-inspired role-playing game in development by Necrosoft Games, is launching this summer after having been delayed last year.</p>
<p>The game's new release window on PC and consoles was confirmed in a new trailer shown during yesterday's PC Gaming Show which also provided a quick look at one week in the life of a Demonschool student, which doesn't exclusively involve hunting demons. The available activities look varied enough, so it definitely looks like the experience will have no trouble staying fresh for its entire duration.</p>
<p><iframe title="A week in the life of a Demonschool student" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwwaGNyrMdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, I had the chance to try out a Demonschool demo before its public release, and really enjoyed what I played, despite the available in-game week not being as varied as the one showcased in the latest trailer. The combat system is probably what I liked best about the demo, together with its aesthetics, and what sets the game apart the most from the latest entries in the series.</p>
<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>
<p>Demonschool launches this summer on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Beast of Reincarnation, an action RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan and developed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamefreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon series developer</a>, has been announced for a 2026 release.</p>
<p>The game was revealed with a new trailer shared during yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, which provided a first look at the game's setting, main character Emma, an outcast cursed as a Blighted One, her canine companion Koo, and the many dangerous enemies they will have to face.
