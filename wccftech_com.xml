			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>
