			<p>To say that Bungie has had a bad couple of years would be an understatement, in many ways. Despite the small boost that came along with Destiny 2: The Final Shape,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/"> layoffs</a>, scandals <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">around stolen work</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">reports of poor and greedy leadership</a> overshadow anything positive the studio has going on.</p>



<p>The latest negative tally to add to the pile comes from a report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-steam-franchise-history-bungie-trust/">The Game Post</a>, which points to Destiny 2's <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660#1m">Steam Chart numbers</a>, which hit an all-time low for the game since its release on Steam in 2019. It should be said that Steam numbers aren't everything, but it's still not necessarily a good look for Destiny 2 to be in such a low place <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">after the recent launch of its Edge of Fate expansion</a>, and ahead of a very major <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">Star Wars expansion called Renegades</a>, which is due out this coming December.</p>



<p>Per the Steam Charts, Destiny 2's monthly average was 18,349 players when The Game Post published its report. At the time of this writing, the average is listed at 18,100 players for the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Is a Star Wars expansion the medicine Bungie needs for Destiny 2 to turn player counts like this around? It could be. Technically, anything is possible. Whether it will is an entirely different question. Even if the idea of wielding a lightsaber gets players to pick Destiny 2 back up, or even to try it for the first time, one of the game's lasting issues has been how obtuse it is to get into or get back into, even if you are a returning player.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, the studio just yesterday announced that it is hosting <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">a closed technical test for Marathon that players can sign up for</a>, and Pete Parsons, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">who was at the studio's helm for years, has left his role and retired</a>. </p>

			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games is no longer launching on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">previously announced Halloween 2025 release date</a>. Instead, we no longer know when it is coming out on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Yacht Club Games announced the delay with <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a blog post on its website</a>, where it held that this would not be "<em>a major delay</em>," and that the team just needs "<em>a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.</p><p>Read the full announcement here➡️<a href="https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs">https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs</a> <a href="https://t.co/WXFqcbUl3x">pic.twitter.com/WXFqcbUl3x</a></p></div>— Yacht Club Games (@YachtClubGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/YachtClubGames/status/1975293906251296964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line</em>," Yacht Club continued. "<em>The game is so close to being done - we're playing it from start to finish every day.</em>"</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest for October 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, but in the most recent Steam Next Fest for the year this past June, Mina the Hollower was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">one of Wccftech's call-outs for what people should spend their time playing while the festival is on</a>.</p>



<p>When we checked out the demo, we wrote, "<em>The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-won-t-affect-every-existing-user/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-reportedly-won%E2%80%99t-affect-every-existing-subscriber.1318786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Game Pass price hike announced on October 1, 2025, reportedly will not affect every existing subscriber when it goes into effect next month.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/">official Xbox Game Pass subreddit</a> earlier today, users shared recent emails informing them of the price increase, noting that some subscriptions will not be affected. Most exempt subscriptions exempt from the automatic increase are for users in European countries like Poland, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7d85l/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7gokr/">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni83ymw/">Italy</a>, and Asian countries like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni8url6/">Indonesia</a>. This is likely due to local laws preventing an automatic price increase without the user's consent, although Microsoft has yet to provide confirmation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Xbox Game Pass subscription service has seen significant changes besides a price increase this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">rearranging subscription tiers into Essential, Premium, and Ultimate</a>. <span>While the Ultimate tier will offer considerable value with the addition of the Ubisoft + Classics library, the Fortnite Crew subscription, and day-one access to Xbox-published games, its steep price increase to $29.99/month wasn't well-received, so much so that the page to&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank">cancel the subscription was briefly overwhelmed.</a></span></p>



<p>Although the Xbox Game Pass service has seen multiple price increases, it will remain a central pillar of Xbox's market strategy. According to Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/">the service is a profitable business</a> that has reached a record high of $5 billion and is becoming more valuable for both users and creators.</p>
