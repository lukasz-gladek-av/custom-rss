			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has shared his first monthly sales report of 2026 for video game sales in the US, and it's <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> taking the top spot on the premium sales charts for January 2026. Overall spending in the video game industry in the US was up <strong>3%</strong> compared to last year, with subscription services and hardware sales driving that growth.</p>



<p>It's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's second month in a row sitting atop the US premium game sales charts, though finishing 2025 as the best-selling game of December was not enough to beat <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, which was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game of 2025 in the US.</a> That said, the lack of content coming to Battlefield 6 (its second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">only arrived earlier this week</a>) did not help its January 2026 sales, as the game fell out of the top three to <strong>fifth</strong> place on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> kept its second-place spot, <strong>Minecraft</strong> moved up to fourth place from eighth, and <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong> went from fourth to third. Overall, not a whole lot of shuffle in the top five, but in the top ten, there was one very notable entry that moved up from <strong>225th</strong> place all the way to <strong>ninth</strong> place. </p>



<p>That game was <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong>, which made its massive jump into the top ten thanks to its release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> last month.</a> Technically, even though <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> sits between FFVII and the only new release on the charts, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/">Code Vein 2</a></strong>, it's probable that Code Vein 2 missed the top ten because of FFVII Remake.</p>



<p>That said, at least when looking solely at PC game sales in the US, Code Vein 2 sat at the top of the charts.</p>







<p>The only other game included in the top 20 for January 2026 that wasn't already one of the top 30 best-selling games in the US for December 2025 was <strong>Fallout 4</strong>, which just eeks in at the number 20 spot after being in <strong>68th</strong> place in December 2025. </p>



<p>As we move deeper into the year, it'll be interesting to see how long Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 can hold a spot above Battlefield 6 in the charts, and which upcoming games are able to keep both of them out of first place.</p>



<p>Moving away from the sales charts, while January isn't known for being a major period in the year for players spending a lot on games, especially since it arrives just after the holiday craze, overall spending in the US video games industry was up <strong>3% </strong>compared to January 2025, driven by hardware and subscription spending. </p>







<p>A sign that people were probably using their monetary holiday gifts to grab a new console, specifically the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which were the number one and two best-selling hardware units for January 2026. Looking at hardware spending alone, January 2026 was a <strong>16% increase</strong> compared to January 2025.</p>



<p>With the January 2026 report in the books, it'll be interesting to see where the charts line up for February 2026, especially since there are more than a few major releases from this month, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/">one-million unit seller <strong>Nioh 3</strong></a> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>Ubisoft </strong>chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> has finally spoken outside of the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">financial earnings reports</a> after kicking off 2026 by confirming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>"</a> that involved huge structural changes to Ubisoft and saw hundreds of developers get laid off, either <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">through cuts</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/">different branches</a> or just <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">full studio shutdowns</a>. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a>, Guillemot didn't offer any meaningful comments in response to questions about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">strikes across different studios within the company</a> or provide any further comment as to why projects like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> were cancelled that we hadn't heard before. But he did at least provide an update as to what's happening with a couple of the company's major franchises.</p>



<p>In terms of the <strong>Far Cry</strong> series, Guillemot confirmed that <strong>two new games</strong> are in development, one of which we can likely assume to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry 7</a>,</strong> while the other is likely to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/">Project Maverick</a></strong>, the multiplayer Far Cry game we first heard about more than three years ago.</p>



<p>The other series Guillemot provided a bit of an update on is, unsurprisingly, <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>. Guillemot confirmed there are "<em>several</em>" Assassin's Creed titles in the works, <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">which isn't exactly news</a>, but he did add that the projects include both <strong>single-player</strong> and <strong>multiplayer</strong> games. </p>



<p>"<em>We have a solid pipeline underway across <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>. Under the 'Assassin's Creed' brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year</em>," Guillemot said. "<em>On 'Far Cry,' anticipation is high, and we currently have <strong>two very promising projects in development</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, in relation to what both franchises are doing outside of video games, Guillemot gave a shout-out to the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-series-fx-now-official-produced-fargo-creator-noah-hawley/">Far Cry TV series coming from <strong>FX</strong></a> and confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-dogs-film-is-in-development-and-already-has-its-protagonist/"><strong>Watch Dogs</strong> film has completed production.</a> He also shared his excitement about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/">Assassin's Creed <strong>Netflix </strong>TV series</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/"><strong>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</strong> series getting renewed</a> for a second season.  </p>



<p>Overall, if you were hoping for a candid explanation as to what has happened with the company over the last few years, and what Guillemot and the rest of its top brass are doing to turn things around for the better, to say you'll be left wanting is an understatement.</p>



<p>Especially when it comes to Guillemot's response to questions about nepotism with regard to installing his son, <strong>Charlie Guillemot</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">one of the two co-leaders of Vantage Studios.</a></p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades</em>," Guillemot said.</p>



<p>"<em>I <strong>strongly believe </strong>that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as co-CEOs of Vantage Studios. They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role</em>."</p>



<p>As a reminder, Derennes steps into the role after previously leading Ubisoft's North American studios under the company's old structure. Charlie Guillemot's track record, however, includes being given a studio head position at Ubisoft right out of college, with the sole game that studio put out getting cancelled after one year and a major controversy. It also includes leaving Ubisoft to start an NFT-focused company, and one other role within Ubisoft before being given the keys to its biggest franchises.</p>
