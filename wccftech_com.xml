			<p>The story behind the MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, its development team (<strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>), its founder and CEO <strong>Steven Sharif</strong>, and its major investors (<strong>Robert Dawson</strong>, <strong>Jason Caramanis</strong>) continues to get messier.</p>



<p>As you might remember, Jason Caramanis publicly accused Steven Sharif of fraud, embezzlement, and other illegal acts, and mentioned that Sharif would be the target of several lawsuits, including one already filed by <strong>TFE Games Holdings</strong> against Steven Sharif and his husband, John Moore, <strong>on February 9, 2026</strong>, in the Nevada District Court, Clark County. However, a few days ago, Sharif himself <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72286984/1/sharif-v-dawson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>filed a counter-lawsuit</strong></a> in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, against Robert Dawson and others (<strong>not against Caramanis, though</strong>), including the aforementioned <strong>TFE Games Holdings LLC</strong>, a Delaware-based LLC created and controlled by Dawson that the filing describes as having been created for the sole purpose of receiving, exploiting, and monetizing Intrepid's trade secrets and intellectual property.</p>



<p>One of the most explosive revelations from the new legal documents is that between late 2022 and early 2023, a major game development company <strong>offered hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire Ashes of Creation and the studio behind it</strong>. However, Dawson allegedly urged Sharif to reject the deal in favor of continuing development under his financing, which eventually led to the talks with the acquiring company ending. This company is never named in the filing, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p-mL-Nlq4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new video interview with NefasQS</a>, who was the first one to break the veil of mystery on this whole controversy, Caramanis reveals that "<strong>the only company that I know they had dialogues with that they communicated with was Riot</strong>."</p>



<p>Needless to say, it's a surprising turn of events (albeit not officially confirmed) that the public didn't know about before. Riot's backing could have certainly helped Ashes of Creation, although they have been working on their own <strong>League of Legends MMO</strong> for several years without anything to show for it. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was rebooted in March 2024</a></strong>, and we still haven't learned anything concrete about it.</p>



<p>Anyway, the counter-lawsuit frames this as the turning point in their relationship: Sharif alleges that, seeing the company's real potential for extremely high returns, <strong>Dawson then began a campaign to seize control of the company</strong>, but notably, he did so "without consideration for the quality of the game and the typical development timeline of MMORPGs."</p>



<p>The allegations made by Sharif against Dawson only get harsher from here on. According to Sharif, from <strong>early 2023 through May 2024</strong>, Dawson repeatedly threatened to withhold payroll and health insurance financing just before payroll deadlines, to shut the company down through litigation, and to cause Sharif <strong>financial ruin and physical harm</strong>, unless Sharif signed documents granting him progressively greater equity and control. The filing lists the following examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dawson demanded <strong>a warrant granting him 10% of the company for $10</strong></li>



<li>He demanded <strong>zero-cost non-dilutable equity options</strong> in his convertible debt notes</li>



<li>He <strong>required Sharif to involve him in all discussions with company counsel,</strong> despite having no right to that access (at least according to Sharif)</li>



<li>He <strong>falsely represented that he was an agent of the Company</strong> to retain Company counsel</li>
</ul>



<p>Steven Sharif <strong>claimed to have suffered from severe health issues due to these undue threats and pressure</strong>, including a hypertensive emergency, acute kidney failure, hospitalization, and vision loss from blood pressure complications, including macular edema. </p>



<p>As a result of debt-to-equity conversions under the <strong>May 2024 Settlement Agreement</strong>, <strong>Dawson became the majority shareholder</strong><span><strong>, holding</strong>&nbsp;4,008.67 shares of Class A, B, and C Common Stock, representing</span> roughly <strong>58% of all shares in Intrepid Studios</strong>. Under that same agreement, Sharif <strong>expressly retained full creative control of the Company</strong>, even as Dawson gained financial and governance control.</p>

<iframe title="RIOT Games Was Supposed to Buy Ashes of Creation???" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p-mL-Nlq4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At a subsequent Board meeting that took place on September 4, 2024, Dawson was appointed Chairman of the Board, and <strong>Ryan Ogden</strong> was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Dawson then directed Ogden to open new Intrepid bank accounts at Pathway Bank, which the lawsuit frames as a bank over which Dawson exercises de facto or de jure control. From this point, Sharif<strong> was effectively stripped of all financial authority and ceased to have any access to active company bank accounts</strong>. By August 2025, Dawson added Theresa Fette and Aaron Bartels (both of whom are also among the lawsuit's defendants) to the board. From that point until Sharif's formal resignation dated January 19, 2026, <strong>the full board consisted of Dawson, Ogden, Fette, Bartels, and Sharif</strong>, who claimed that Ogden, Fette, and Bartels were acting at Dawson's behest rather than as independent directors.</p>



<p>Even the early access launch of Ashes of Creation, clearly rushed by most gamers' judgment, <strong>was forced by the board against Sharif's and other senior leadership's advice</strong>, at least according to Sharif's own reconstruction of the events. The filing also states that prior to the board's interference, Ashes of Creation had achieved an unusually strong Day 30 player retention rate of approximately 76%.</p>



<p>Critically, it is alleged that Ryan Ogden <strong>specifically assured CommerceWest Bank that Steam revenue from the Early Access launch would cover the outstanding loan obligations</strong>. As a reminder, Caramanis had alleged that Sharif was notified by Valve that a Steam payout was incoming, and then Sharif deliberately allowed or directed those funds to flow to the CommerceWest Bank loan, which Caramanis described as Sharif essentially using company money to cover a personal debt, since the $6 million loan was personally guaranteed by his husband, John Moore.</p>



<p>The two accounts actually agree on the assurance given to CommerceWest Bank, but <strong>the funds themselves appear to still be frozen</strong>. Prior to the foreclosure, Ogden had specifically directed Valve to divert the Steam revenue owed to Intrepid into a new Pathway Bank account opened for TFE, but <strong>Valve refused to comply</strong>. On February 3, 2026, <strong>Valve terminated Intrepid's Steam partnership entirely</strong>, citing multiple conflicting requests from alleged account administrators trying to change Intrepid's banking information, demands from multiple potential creditors for Intrepid's revenues, and a large volume of player refund requests. The filing states that before refunds, <strong>Intrepid would have been entitled to approximately $5 million from Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>Sharif's counter-lawsuit lists eight specific violations of the law:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defend Trade Secrets Act</strong> (federal): Misappropriation of Intrepid's IP and trade secrets</li>



<li><strong>California Uniform Trade Secrets Act</strong>: The same, albeit under state law</li>



<li><strong>California Commercial Code violations</strong>: The Article 9 foreclosure was procedurally unlawful, commercially unreasonable, and conducted without required notice to senior creditors</li>



<li><strong>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: Board defendants failed their duties of loyalty, care, candor, and independence to the company and shareholders</li>



<li><strong>Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: This one specifically targets TFE for knowingly facilitating the board's breaches</li>



<li><strong>Corporate Waste</strong>: The board's actions were so reckless and devoid of legitimate business purpose that they constituted a waste of corporate assets</li>



<li><strong>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</strong>: A direct personal claim by Sharif, based on the deliberate campaign to destroy his reputation and safety</li>



<li><strong>Civil Conspiracy</strong>: All defendants knowingly conspired to misappropriate IP and trade secrets and to scapegoat Sharif publicly</li>
</ol>



<p> The filing requests a variety of remedies, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>An injunction to prevent the defendants from accessing, using, or selling the trade secrets related to Ashes of Creation</li>



<li>The annulment of the wrongful foreclosure</li>



<li>Compensation for consequential and punitive damages</li>



<li>The disgorgement of profits</li>



<li>The removal of the board of directors</li>



<li>The establishment of a constructive trust</li>



<li>The payment of legal fees</li>



<li>Permanent injunctive relief against future misconduct</li>
</ul>



<p>By the way, Steven Sharif himself <strong>appeared in the YouTube chat of the linked NefasQS video to share this message</strong>:</p>



<p><em>My goal is maximum accountability. I am glad to see Jason commenting and sharing as much as he is, I think you are doing a great job with that @NefasQS, so thank you for that. It obviously would not make much sense for me to fight a battle in the court of public opinion, when the truth will come out obviously in court. Federal court is not like state court; there is a higher burden of factual proof required. I would not sign my name to that document if I was not certain of the truthfulness.</em></p>



<p>To say that the situation is intricate would be an understatement. We'll keep tracking the development of this legal battle; stay tuned.</p>

<p><em>"A hidden cutscene with what I think are beings from the higher plane and Athena talking about Odin and Atreus. There is also another character called 'Robed Figure', who says 'To lefkó fídi tha se fáei.' Greek for 'The white snake will eat you.'

<p><em>"One failed us.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer <strong>Jake Solomon</strong>, known mostly for <strong>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</strong>, <strong>XCOM 2</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-midnight-suns-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a></strong>, announced the closure of <strong>Midsummer Studios</strong>. Solomon had founded the development team after leaving <strong>Firaxis</strong>. In 2024, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed him to learn more about his next game</a></strong>, a narrative-driven life simulation for which he had already raised $6 million in seed funding.</p>



<p>Rather than going for a traditional sandbox-like approach in the vein of the king of the genre, <strong>The Sims</strong> from <strong>Maxis</strong>, the game was conceived around player-driven storytelling. <strong>It was a systems-based approach where conflict, relationships, and consequences would combine to generate compelling, episodic personal stories</strong>. Characters would have jobs, love lives, and competing desires, with failure treated not as a dead end but as a narrative opportunity, in the spirit of improv theater. <strong>There would be no game-over screen</strong>.<br>The game was designed to be <strong>open-ended and ongoing</strong>, with <strong>no fixed conclusion</strong>, and Solomon expressed hopes that a thriving modding community would emerge over time. It would have been a single-player experience only, built in Unreal Engine 5 with a stylized visual approach, deliberately designed to keep the team small and the production sustainable.</p>



<p>The closure announcement came directly from Solomon, who <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a post on X</a> and also shared a brief Pre-Alpha footage of the game, which was codenamed "<strong>Burbank</strong>":</p>



<p><em>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios, I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into. It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</em></p>



<p><em>We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Solomon later admitted that <strong>Burbank's characters used AI for memory, reasoning, and speech</strong>, allowing players to create any characters they wanted and drop them into any story. The art, however, was entirely human-made.</p>



<p>It's yet another closure at a dire time for the gaming industry. Just yesterday, <strong>Sony</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, the maker of the <strong>Demon's Souls remake</strong>. However, Solomon's studio has perhaps more in common with the <strong>"extinction level event"</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was mentioned by <strong>Denis Dyack</strong></a>: the failed <strong>$2 billion deal</strong> between <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and <strong>Savvy Group</strong>, which <strong>flooded the market with prototypes of AA and AAA games</strong>, thus making it much harder for indie studios to get funding.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 Sells 1M Copies, Is the Fastest-Selling Game in the Series; Franchise Reaches 10M Units Sold]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/</link>
            <guid>1441435</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>KOEI TECMO</strong> and <strong>TEAM NINJA</strong> announced that <strong>Nioh 3</strong> has already become a <strong>million-seller</strong> and is, to date, <strong>the fastest-selling game in the action RPG series</strong>. We previously had a glimpse of the game's early success in its concurrent player peak on Steam, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which far surpassed its predecessors'</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Another side is the very strong critical reception, which is being celebrated with a dedicated accolades trailer that <strong>prominently features our own review score (9.8/10)</strong>. Earlier this month, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in great detail</a> why he felt <strong>Nioh 3 is the Japanese developer's best work yet</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The only real downsides are the performance issues, although that's not exactly surprising given that <strong>KOEI TECMO and TEAM NINJA have historically always struggled in this area</strong>. In Wccftech's technical analysis and graphics tuning guide, Sebastian Castellanos <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-pc-graphics-tuning-guide-how-to-get-the-best-experience-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Frankly, Nioh 3 underwhelms when it comes to its achieved balance between visual fidelity and performance — and that’s disappointing for a AAA PC title released in 2026. Despite generally strong reviews for its combat systems and world design, the PC port still carries forward some of the same technical shortcomings that plagued previous Team Ninja releases: subpar optimization on both the CPU and GPU, and an engine that struggles to present a stable experience unless the game is locked to fixed framerates.</em></p>



<p><em>The Katana Engine’s sensitivity to non-standard framerates results in noticeable judder and uneven camera motion when your framerate isn't holding at a steady framerate figure, and many players are still reporting performance issues even on fairly powerful hardware. These issues are not minor tweaking details — they are foundational to the core gameplay feel, and it’s frankly unacceptable that a AAA 2026 PC release ships in this state, requiring players to lock framerates or rely heavily on upscaling/frame generation just to achieve a semblance of stability.</em></p>



<p><em>In short, while Nioh 3 unquestionably has depth and quality in its combat and systems, those strengths are strongly let down by a technical package that feels unfinished and insufficiently optimized. In the modern PC landscape — where much better-looking titles offer solid uncapped performance, smooth frametimes, and correct behavior with fluctuating framerates — Nioh 3 feels like a step backward. Until game updates from Team Ninja or community mods address these issues in a meaningful way, getting a truly impressive visuals to performance balance out of this game remains an uphill battle.</em></p>
