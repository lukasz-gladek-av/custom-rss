			<p>In just two days, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully revealed in its very own Nintendo Direct. Fans have been eagerly anticipating any information about the upcoming console, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">rumors</a> flying wildly. Some have been relatively tame and logical, while others have been completely outlandish.</p>
<p>One of the more recent rumors is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in one way or another. Previous rumors that were announced suggested that this resolution will be available when the console is docked, and that the resolution in handheld will be 1080p.</p>
<p>There have now been recent claims that there won't be 4K support, as the dev kits for the Nintendo Switch 2 don't contain any support for 4K resolution. This news comes from the Game Developers Conference (GDC) that took place in San Francisco earlier in March.</p>
<p>"I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email, but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don't have a 4K output," says Tom Henderson during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>. Whether this is true or not is yet to be confirmed by those who have access to the dev kits, but it's also likely that they are unable to confirm anything until Nintendo gives them permission to.</p>
<p>Although a dev kit may not have 4K output, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Nintendo Switch 2 won't support 4K output. Console development kits don't typically match the specifications of the final system, and there is a possibility that a newer dev kit will be released with this potential.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't about the Nintendo Switch 2, based solely on the little information that is available across the internet. Luckily, the Direct is just around the corner, where we will hopefully find out the specifications, extra features, and price tag of the console. It's uncertain whether any games will be announced during this Direct or whether it will be focused solely on the console itself.</p>
<p>This console comes with new Joy-Cons, which look like they will be more stable overall compared to the first console. Hopefully, a lot of questions will be answered about what to expect from this console for both developers and consumers. Just three days ago, there was a leak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/">US retailer documents</a> that showed the potential pre-order plans, with an expected date for pre-orders opening to be April 9.</p>

			<p>Canadian developer Eidos Montréal has laid off 75 employees. The studio <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the news with the following message shared on social media channels:</p>
<p><em>Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services. These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development.</em></p>
<p>Besides the unfortunate (albeit sadly common in the industry lately) fact that people are losing their jobs, the message's wording is definitely interesting. Eidos Montréal singled out the end of a specific work commission as the cause of the layoffs, and the mind cannot but go to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that the developer had been helping out Playground Games with the Fable reboot. While the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2026 earlier this year, it was originally supposed to launch in 2025. It's possible and even likely that Fable is now content complete and Playground Games simply does not need any further help from the Canadian studio as it approaches the polishing phase.</p>
<p>Still, it's unfortunate that Eidos Montréal could not reassign those employees to its other projects. This is not the studio's only recent round of layoffs; it also had to cut 97 employees in January 2024 following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of a new Deus Ex game</a>. It is unclear what else the studio might be working on right now; its latest game is still the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underrated Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, sister studio Crystal Dynamics, which worked closely with Eidos Montréal on projects like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Marvel's Avengers, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the removal of 17 employees. Crystal Dynamics is also helping out with the reboot of a Microsoft-owned IP, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, in collaboration with The Initiative.</p>
