			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PS5 Pro is fast approaching, and with it comes a ton of enhanced games that will be released on the console, offering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-pssr-is-a-game-changer-to-bring-visual-fidelity-to-the-next-level-says-insomniac/">new graphical fidelity</a> options and upgrades to make it a worthwhile experience to play on that console rather than the ordinary PS5. The list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games is already pretty hefty and continues to grow. As a matter of fact, it's double the list of games that the PS4 Pro had when it launched. When the PS4 Pro launched, it had over 40 enhanced games, with the console being released in November 2016. So far, the PS5 Pro has a <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/03/ps5-pro-enhanced-games-double-than-ps4-pro-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed list of over 80 games</a> thus far, with the console officially launching on November 7.</p>
<p>There is already quite a hefty list of games that will be available on the PS5 Pro, with quite a few of them bound to be a smoother experience overall than the experience you'd ordinarily have on the PS5. This is due to updates and hardware that will help make the game run smoother. While PC has generally been seen as the advantageous platform to choose from, in modern days, games typically run better on console at launch, as there is a lot less to consider when patching the game and making updates for compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that games will look or even feel better on the PS5 Pro, but you'd certainly hope so, as that is what you're paying for. It will be a matter of "wait and see," but there is a great catalog of games available for those who are planning on picking up the new and improved PS5. Some of these games had some issues on the PS5 when the titles were released, so it'll be interesting to see that once the PS5 Pro comes out, they will have improved performance after all. It's worth noting that some of these games haven't been released yet, so the PS5 Pro enhancements at launch apply to the launch of the game in this case rather than the console.</p>
<p>Games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Demon's Souls, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered are some that will be ready for the PS5 Pro when it launches and will provide new graphical updates and smoother performance. Considering that there were complaints about performance for both Dragon's Dogma 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it will certainly be interesting to see if the PS5 Pro version of the game helps to improve it in any way.</p>
