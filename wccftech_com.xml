			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign may not run well at launch on the "latest GPUs", forcing users to reduce graphics settings or resolution to avoid experiencing frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware shared the patch notes for the day one update, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-Patch101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.01</a>, which improves the handling of playable characters, adjusts the soundtrack, text and balance, adds character scenarios and addresses some unspecified bugs. Accompanying the official patch notes is a warning for PC users that PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops. This issue is under investigation, but anyone experiencing a significant drop is advised to turn down graphics settings from the default High to Medium or Low, or lower the game's resolution.</p>
<p>While it is not specified which new graphics cards currently have trouble running the game properly, it's very likely the Elden Ring Nightreign developer was talking about the NVIDIA RTX 50 series cards, as during my over 30 hours with Elden Ring Nightreign, I did not experience any significant performance issue on an RTX 4080. As such, if you own one of these new GPUs, it may be a good idea to hold off getting the game until the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>Performance issues on new GPUs and some glaring oversights, such as the lack of cross-platform play, Elden Ring Nightreign is an incredibly engaging experience that masterfully twists the typical Souls series formula to provide a fast-paced co-op experience that is hard to put down. You can learn more about this engaging experience with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Squad 22: ZOV</a> is a new squad tactics game that just released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/">Steam</a> yesterday, and claims to be "<em>officially recommended</em>" by the Russian military "<em>for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>, the game's <a href="https://squad22.online/">website</a> claims that the development team includes soldiers currently fighting in the war between Ukraine and Russia, and claims that it shows "<em>History as it</em> <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>The website reads,"<em>Dive into 2014 and 2022-2024 events, through different campaigns and learn how people who lived in them saw what happened, how it affected their lives and changed opinions</em>."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has already published articles about Squad 22: ZOV, and how it is Russian military propaganda that aims to "<em>mythologize the war and its participants</em>" from Russia's point of view, to bring young Russian men into the fold of the army.</p>
<p>"<em>The Squad 22: ZOV game is not just entertainment, but an element of propaganda aimed at justifying the war and creating a heroic myth about the Russian</em> <em>military,</em>" the Center for Countering Disinformation writes.</p>
<p>"<em>This is another step in the militarization of Russian society and its preparation for a long-term war.</em>"</p>
<p>It's unclear how exactly Squad 22: ZOV was able to get its Steam listing and pass through moderation checks. Valve has not yet commented on the game, nor has it taken action to remove the game like it recently did with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">game explicitly depicting sexual violence</a>, or how it removed a game depicting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>
