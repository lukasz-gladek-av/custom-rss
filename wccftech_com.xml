			<p>Another week, another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-Ultimate-is-everywhere/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud gaming service</a>. This week, eight games are entering the service, while an additional title is added to the list of games playable with the RTX 5080-powered Blackwell servers. Also, those servers are just one region away from completing NVIDIA's campaign to make them available worldwide.</p>



<p>Regarding the games joining the service this week, the heavy-hitters are titles like the highly anticipated Persona-like indie game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the early access release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-pubg-productions/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, the new survival game from PUBG Productions that's finally releasing in early access. It's a different kind of class of heavy-hitters <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/">compared to last week's batch of games,</a> but they're heavy hitters nonetheless.</p>



<p>As far as the game that's now RTX 5080-ready, it's Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. A game that definitely didn't get off to a great start with players, but has since been updated for a much smoother experience that doesn't involve a bunch of frustrating insta-fail stealth missions. At least it was always a good looking game, and now that you can play it through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, it can look even better.</p>



<p>Speaking of those Blackwell servers, last week it was Phoenix getting added to the list of regions where RTX 5080 servers were available. The only remaining region on NVIDIA's list now is Stockholm, which isn't ready to go live this week, but will be ready soon. As a reminder, the Blackwell servers are only available to players subscribed to GeForce NOW at the Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>"<em>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere</em>," head of partnerships and licensing at 2K, Sean Haran, added with regard to GeForce NOW in a press release. "<em>Anyone can experience the glory of Borderlands 4, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you're at home or on the move.</em>"</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spongebob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide</li>



<li>Long Drive North</li>



<li>Demonschool</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</li>



<li>Prologue: Go Wayback!</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>



<li>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Sacred 2 Remaster</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, exactly one year after its initial release on PC and Xbox Series S|X, following the end of the timed console exclusivity deal with Microsoft.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> an interview with GSC Game World focused on the PS5 launch, but we also asked about the content and features that are still to come. Ahead of last year's launch, the Ukrainian studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the game would eventually be updated with features like multiplayer, cross-platform mods, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. However, twelve months later, there is still no news to share on that front. However, we did get confirmation that the first STALKER 2 DLC will launch at some point in 2026. As a reminder, the game's Ultimate Edition is still being sold with the promise that its Season Pass would include 'two future expansions and all upcoming DLCs'.</p>



<p>We also inquired about the announced upgrade to a newer version of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. </p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.7</a> has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now.</em></p>



<p>Finally, we wanted to know if GSC Game World was satisfied with the performance of STALKER 2 so far.</p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a>&nbsp;and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</em></p>
