			<p>The Magnus APU will reportedly power the Xbox next-generation console and a line of Xbox PCs, employing a strategy that will greatly benefit AMD.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705701">known AMD leaker Kepler L2</a> outright said that the Magnus APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">last month</a> is not only going to power the next-generation Microsoft console but also <em>"Xbox PCs"</em> with the APU getting licensed out to OEM partners. Bar a few likely differences, these systems should be essentially the same, as another known insider, HeisenbergFX4, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705260">believes</a> there won't be any special development required for the Xbox next-generation console, since no developer would put in additional work for what is setting out to be a small, niche market.</p>



<p>Ultimately, having a desktop chiplet powering the next-generation Xbox system as well as regular Xbox-branded PCs will be a big win for AMD, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> in a new video going over the leaked APUs for the next-generation consoles. Not only will production numbers be high, but AMD will likely be able to get better prices from TSMC while also benefiting from the optimization work done for the Xbox next-generation system. Considering how game optimization issues are rampant in the PC space nowadays, this could also become a great marketing point for the company and the Xbox partner OEMs.</p>

<p>The Xbox next-generation Magnus APU is set to mark a massive change in the console space. Its chiplet design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, is very different from the most recent console APUs, and will potentially power <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">a more iterative approach to console design</a>, allowing Microsoft to offer more frequent upgrades and possibly do away with the traditional console cycle. With console-exclusive games quickly becoming a thing of the past, it's not surprising to see how all console manufacturers seem to be going in different directions, an approach set to make the next generation of consoles one of the most interesting to date.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 580.97) today, optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced.</p>



<p>While Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released a while ago</a>, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced is coming out today, simultaneously with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-unreal-engine-5-updated-playstation-5-pro-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 launch</a>. On PC, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in May 2024</a>, it already supported NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With the Enhanced version, though, GeForce RTX 50 GPU owners can enable DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to boost performance even further. That is quite welcome, since this new version adds a 'Very High' graphics preset that was not available at launch:</p>



<p><em>Rather than dialling everything up, our team carefully considered where we could make the most impactful improvements for a visual quality bump at a reasonable performance cost. The result sees more detailed and accurate shadows, improved AntiAliasing, better post-processing such as depth of field, motion blur and bloom.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As to GTA V Enhanced, Rockstar's game is also getting NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation. Even with all the ray-traced effects activated (ambient occlusion, global illumination lighting, shadows, and reflections), the RTX 5090 averages 485 frames per second at 4K resolution and max settings, with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode and the latest transformer model enabled. On average, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can expect an uplift of 3.9X.</p>

<p>This Friday, the first-person-puzzle-Metroidvania game Supraworld <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869290/Supraworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will debut on Steam Early Access</a> with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Titan Quest II launched last week on Steam Early Access and <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly sold over 300K units</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 with all its technologies (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Stellar Blade's PC launch has been a smashing success, as the game has been confirmed to be the fastest- selling Korean game on the platform.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://t.co/CkPC5KqbI6">financial report </a>for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, Shift Up reported an all-time best performance since the founding of the company, with an operating revenue of 112bn KRW and an operating profit of 68bn KRW. Much of this record-breaking performance is thanks to Stellar Blade, as 58% of the quarterly revenue was from the action RPG. By all metrics, the game continues to be successful even one year after its debut on PlayStation 5, as the game is the fastest-selling Korean game on Steam with <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units sold in three days</a>, and a total of 3 million sales across PC and console. The nearly 200,000 concurrent users peak on Steam also confirms the game's commercial success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">beating every other flasgship AAA games published by Sony</a>, including Ghost of Tsushima (77K peak Steam CCU), God of War (73K), Spider-Man (66K), Horizon: Zero Dawn (57K), and The Last of Us Part 1 (37K).</p>



<p>Seeing how Stellar Blade continues to be successful, it's not surprising to see Shift Up continuing to support it on both PC and PlayStation 5. Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-1-3-0-pc-patch-amd-fsr/">a new patch</a> went live on all formats, introducing improvements and bug fixes for a more enjoyable experience.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5, and may hit Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in the future. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review of the PlayStation 5 release.</a></p>
