<p>The launch of the studio's first new IP in years since the launch of Destiny in 2014, however, will be remarkable even for those who own a <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> but may not be fans of the team which created the iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-a-bold-claim-to-reconnect-with-the-community-without-multiplayer-can-halo-campaign-evolved-really-bring-players-back-together/"><strong>Halo</strong></a> back in the days of the original Xbox, as <em>Marathon</em> will be putting the power of the system to some interesting use.</p>



<p>In the game's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/"><strong>landing page on the PlayStation Official Website</strong></a>, it is confirmed that the extraction shooter will be a PS5 Pro Enhanced title. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"PS5 Pro Enhanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) blends 5K internal rendering into a clean, stable 4K image so your Runner’s view stays sharp, even when the action gets hectic,"</em> the dedicated box on the website reads.</p>



<p>Barring a potential mistake, this would make <em>Marathon</em> the first P<strong>layStation 5 Pro Enhanced competitive title that renders internally at 5K resolution</strong>. Although this isn't really surprising, considering the power of the Sony console and how the game doesn't seem to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">extremely demanding</a></strong>, it may have made more sense to tout how the <strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution would deliver a 4K resolution output with 120 FPS support</strong>, which would definitely be preferable for a shooter than the sharpest image quality., </p>



<p>Hopefully, the system will still be able to deliver the high-framerate <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">gameplay experience that is perfect for a game such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marathon</em>, possibly with the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version of PlaySt</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ation Spectral Super Resolution,&nbsp;</strong>which will reportedly be available by March 2026. What is colloquially known as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">PSSR 2.0</a></strong> is said to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/">significantly boost </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/"><strong>performance</strong></a>, which would definitely help a game rendering at a high internal resolution achieve higher framerates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://nikopartners.com/">Niko Partners</a></strong>, a research firm that provides global data analysis and insights into the video game industry in five regions, namely China, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), has published its <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/"><strong>2026 predictions</strong> report</a>, with 10 trends for consumers to be aware of, and it's not good news for anyone who has held off on buying a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Namely because Niko believes that the best time to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 is: right now, before <strong>Nintendo issues a "<em>global price hike</em>" for the new hybrid device</strong>. According to the research firm, at some point in 2026, the added weight of "<em>tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions</em>" will drive a global price hike for the console, with Nintendo following in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> </a>footsteps after both companies increased the prices of their consoles post-launch.</p>



<p>Niko's prediction doesn't include an exact price consumers should expect, but it does add that the Mario company "<em>may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead</em>," which would mean we'd see at least a <strong>$50</strong> price increase.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the latest word from Nintendo on a potential Switch 2 price increase came from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/">recent interview with Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>,</a> who simply said that the company "<em>must monitor the situation closely</em>." Before that, back in November 2025, Furukawa told shareholders that the company expects the price of the Switch 2 to remain where it is,<em> </em><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><em>"unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 was unveiled on the same day the current US government announced its new tariffs back in <strong>April 2025</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">concerns of a Switch 2 price increase have been sky-high.</a> It didn't help that Nintendo had to pause pre-orders and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/">follow the flow of news regarding where the tariff negotiations were going before it could lock in a price</a>. Or that when pre-orders were finally back on, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/"><strong>the price of Switch 2 accessories had already increased</strong> compared to what they were initially meant to be</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the price of the Switch 2 has remained the same, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">we've had multiple warnings</a> that the price could go up, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs being cited as a potential cause more than once</a>. Now, adding in the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage situation</a></strong> (even if <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">consumers reportedly have the narrative around the shortages wrong</a></strong>), the fact remains that a price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2 feels more like a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.</p>



<p>With all that said, this report doesn't factor in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-been-leaky-maybe-they-need-a-plumber-new-potential-nintendo-switch-2-model-discovered-on-official-website/">recent rumours of a <strong>Switch 2 Lite</strong> model</a> potentially arriving soon, which could offer a happy medium for people who want to grab a Switch 2 but don't want to pay its current $449 price. So long as Nintendo doesn't increase the price of the Switch 2 to $499 and release a Switch 2 Lite at $449. </p>
