			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>
