			<p>In a talk at this week's D.I.C.E. Summit <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via PCGamer</a>, an industry conference took place where the theme was sustainability. At this talk, Obsidian Entertainment VP of Operations Marcus Morgan and VP of Development Justin Britch said that they want Obsidian Entertainment to make it to its 100th birthday. Considering the rocky state of the game industry at present, this seems like something that is highly unlikely. However, Obsidian Entertainment does have a history of making incredibly popular games, such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds, and most recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/"> Avowed</a>.</p>
<p>Obsidian is currently 22 years old, which means that the company has a further 78 years to go. The VPs think that this is incredibly doable as long as they stick to the ideas of staying lean, keeping talent, and setting realistic sales expectations. Compared to other companies, Obsidian is more focused on making games that sit well with the players and have an impact rather than focusing solely on the amount of money it can make.</p>
<p>One of the main pillars in the plan for sustainability is staying "lean and invested," with the company remaining small enough so that none of the employees at the company feel like a cog in a machine and still feel human and impactful in the company. However, it wasn't always this way, as Morgan and Britch stated that they had considered opening up studios internationally but decided not to go ahead with it in the event it weakened Obsidian's pre-existing work culture.</p>
<p>Instead of funneling all of the company's money into a single project, hoping that it will make a massive profit, Britch says that the studio spends time determining how much to invest in the project based on the assumption that it will be a "mild success," rather than a smash hit. This is something that companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft could learn from, as they have both recently funneled money into two major projects (<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-staff-says-game-was-referred-to-as-the-future-of-playstation/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, respectively.) with neither turning out quite the way they wanted.</p>
<p>While no names were mentioned during this talk at the D.I.C.E. Summit, there are some very clear examples that come to mind. Namely, the sales expectations of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game didn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/">perform nearly as well</a> as EA and BioWare were expecting. As a result, EA laid off staff at BioWare.</p>
<p>Thus far, from the three titles Obsidian Entertainment released in the 2020s, the company has been largely successful with its efforts. Both critics and the general audience have received Grounded, Pentiment, and Avowed positively.</p>
<p>If the company continues on this straight and narrow path, it stands a good chance of making it to its 100th birthday.</p>

			<p>The Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year in Review</a> is now available, which provides a look back at 2024, as well as sharing what's to come this year, including some of the most anticipated features of the store and some massive releases. While there are a fair amount of PC gamers who don't favor the Epic Games Store, the community has continued to grow, with there being more than 295 million PC users (up by 25 million from 2023) and a total of 898 million Epic cross-platform accounts (up by 94 million from 2023.)</p>
<p>Additionally, players are engaging more with games than ever before, with the grand total being amassed to 2.68 billion hours of playtime with third-party games in 2024. With the use of Self-Publishing Tools and opt-in programs being available to up-and-coming developers, the Epic Games Store saw the catalog expand by a whopping 1,100 new games. Even for those who don't want to purchase games, the free games program provides a lot of new and fun titles for those who add them to their library, spanning from triple-A titles to hidden indie gems.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>December was a significant month for the storefront, with there being 74 MAU (Monthly Active Users) in December 2024, which was likely boosted thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-winter-sale-live-now-massive-discounts-for-many-great-games/">holiday sales</a> and the free games that were given away to celebrate the festive season. In total, Epic Games offered 89 free games over the span of 2024, with 595 million free games being claimed by Epic Games Store users. This led to a total value of $2,229 per player, with a 76% average score across all free games provided.</p>
<p>As Epic Games continues to grow and flourish, it has been confirmed that the Free Games Program will continue to run and will now continue on both PC and mobile, allowing players to experience games on handheld devices that they previously wouldn't be able to access.</p>
<p>While most PC gamers purchase their desired titles on Steam, $1.09 billion was spent by PC players in the Epic Games Store, with $255 million spent by players on third-party PC games that were available in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Looking into 2025, Epic Games Store has some major plans for the year ahead. This includes focusing on the Epic Games Store Mobile App, which will allow for an enhanced App Library and Discover Experience with an ever-increasing catalog size. For the developers, there will be AAB file type support.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the storefront has continued to nurture new developers and help them publish games on the app, the store will also add mobile self-publishing tools, which are currently available on an invite-only beta.</p>
<p>There will be some major games coming to the Epic Games Store this year too, including Splitgate 2, 33 Immortals, Killing Floor 3, Borderlands 4 and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

			<p>After getting off to a slightly rocky start, Heart Machine has revealed its plans for Hyper Light Breaker in the game's first Early Access roadmap. The roadmap details a ton of changes coming to the game from February through to April. While a lot of the changes are minor additions in February and March, April will bring a major content update titled "Buried Below." Below is the Early Access roadmap - Spring Edition, which showcases some of the changes and additions you can expect to see in Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Hyper Light Breaker, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">preview here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For those who are excited about the new content, the first monthly content update for Hyper Light Breaker will be released on February 18, which will add in a new Breaker to play, new enemies, Holobytes, Affixes, and plenty of rebalances and performance updates to make sure that the game is fun but also provides a challenge to those who want it while playing this roguelite.</p>
<p>The Breaker being added to Hyper Light Breaker is named Ravona, who was previously codenamed "Crow." Along with this comes new SyComs for Ravona as well as new enemies to face off against, including a new Elite enemy if you find yourself needing a challenge in Hyper Light Breaker. As mentioned above, new Holobytes are being added in this update, such as "Hunter's Mark," as well as new Affixes that provide a new challenge to your playthrough. Ravona has been a highly-anticipated Breaker by the community, with the team saying that the community would request to see gameplay of the character daily since the Breaker was shown in the Gameplay Reveal Trailer.</p>
<p>Because Hyper Light Breaker was released in Early Access, Heart Machine is dedicated to taking on player's feedback and suggestions, where they have the potential to be integrated into the game. Whether that's to provide new content or make much-needed fixes, there will be plenty of updates during the Early Access period. This includes expanded control and graphics options, bug fixes, and a rework of the enemy aggro system.</p>
<p>One of the main fixes that will be added to the game includes a rework of the Medkit system, which was previously perceived as too harsh by the players. Instead, players will now be able to start with a Medkit in their runs.</p>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker is currently available in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
