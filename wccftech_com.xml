			<p>One of the surprises of The Game Awards 2025 (well, I should say up to a few hours before the event, since the announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leak-suggests-game-is-a-remake-of-the-first-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked beforehand</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. Fans of the most famous gaming heroine knew that Crystal Dynamics was working on a new game, which was indeed unveiled at the show, but the remake of the beloved first entry in the action/adventure series was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will offer Lara Croft fans a chance to experience some of the old-school magic in 2026, on the 30th anniversary of the franchise, leaving Crystal Dynamics a bit more time to release the new entry in 2027. The game is being co-developed with Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind Hard Reset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-warrior-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Warrior</a>, Trek to Yomi, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-west-ungodly-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil West</a>.</p>



<p>The Italian website Multiplayer <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis-passato-futuro-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the chance to interview two key developers from Crystal Dynamics</a>, Game Director Will Kerslake and Studio Head Scot Amos, following the TGA 2025 announcement. Speaking about Legacy of Atlantis, they said:</p>



<p><em><strong>Scot Amos:</strong> We want to honor the original DNA of Core Design, but through the lens of the modern gamer.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Will Kerslake:</strong> The realities of 1996 and 2026 are different. We want Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to evoke the same feelings as the first time you played it, but it must be a modern game experience when you play it. We kept the confident Lara and most of the puzzles, but had to completely rebuild the combat and exploration systems. </em></p>



<p>Granted, we wouldn't have expected anything different. This isn't a remaster, and the game would feel very old as a reimagining if those key systems were kept unchanged. Still, Kerslake also said that the brutal traps of the original Tomb Raider, such as the big, deadly rolling boulders, have been maintained.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Crystal Dynamics developers confirmed that the Lara Croft seen in Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and in the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the same character, just in different stages of her life and career. The former game revisits her origins, while Catalyst, which will indeed be set in India <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per earlier rumors</a>, will show Lara at her pinnacle.</p>



<p>In both games, Lara will be voiced by British actress Alix Wilton Regan, whose credits include Calista in The Last Story, Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3, the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Veilguard), Aya in Assassin's Creed Origins, Selemene on Dota: Dragon's Blood, Alt Cunnigham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Daedric Prince Ithelia in The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and the female player character in the upcoming Squadron 42.</p>

			<p>Everstone Studio's online wuxia-themed action/adventure roleplaying game, Where Winds Meet, continues to attract more players to its finely crafted world. <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, the game registered over 15 million players in its first month since launch. This milestone follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous one</a>, when the game had reached over 9 million players in just over two weeks. Granted, four days ago, Everstone Studio also launched Where Winds Meet on iOS and Android, which certainly helped a great deal with its absolutely massive addressable market.</p>



<p>Still, the game deserves much of the success it's enjoying. It's rare to find such a finely made free to play game, almost capable of rivaling premium titles in most regards, and even surpassing them in a few aspects. In Wccftech's 8.5/10 review, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I wish the MMO mode were not strangely devoid of NPCs, which makes it feel significantly less like a real open world compared to the solo mode. Still, it appears that most players are largely unaffected by this design choice.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Anyway, with such a strong fan base behind Where Winds Meet, Everstone is full steam ahead on delivering <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its original promise of a living, constantly evolving wuxia world</a>. This month alone, the players <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can expect new bosses, a new region, and new activities</a>. The developers have also teased the first expansion, The Imperial Palace, which is scheduled for release sometime next year.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025</a>, a new game in the fantasy RPG franchise, Larian Studios has also released Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series S|X. The game was already available on the respective previous consoles (PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One) and could be played on the new ones through backward compatibility, but this is a native version and will therefore offer improved performance.</p>



<p>Existing users can follow Larian's guidelines to upgrade:</p>



<p><em>Depending on your platform, if you already have Divinity: Original Sin 2 installed, you'll receive a free update with the version applicable to your console. If you don't currently have it installed but would like to play again on a current-gen console, navigate to the Divinity: Original Sin 2 store page on either Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and you can download the upgrade for free. If you would like to upgrade your copy of Divinity: Original Sin 2 from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 or from PS4 to PS5 and are based in Japan, the upgrade will cost ¥100.</em></p>







<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition launched in 2018, a year after the base game, expanding the storyline and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-divinity-original-sin-2-refined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refining certain gameplay aspects</a>. The vanilla game was already amazing, though, having been widely acclaimed as one of the greatest cRPGs of all time by critics and fans. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Wccftech</a>, it scored 9.6 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>It's hard to find a game with little to no flaws, but Larian Studios proved that, sometimes, it happens. With excellent story and characters, smart writing and masterfully crafted gameplay enhanced by the multiplayer modes, Divinity: Original Sin 2 truly deserves a place among the best cRPGs ever released.</em></p>



<p>Of course, it would later go on to be surpassed by Baldur's Gate 3. Still, if you haven't played it yet, it's a great way to get accustomed to the world of Rivellon in preparation for the freshly announced new entry. Larian assured that newcomers won't have problems if they choose to wait specifically for the upcoming game, but also said that those who played the previous installments will have knowledge of 'some continuity and characters'.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Cherry Announces Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow, A Free DLC Expansion Arriving in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrow-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1384222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">announced its first DLC expansion</a> for Hollow Knight Silksong, due to arrive next year. Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow will arrive on all platforms sometime in 2026, and when it does, it'll be free for all players. Not only that, but Hollow Knight will make its Nintendo Switch 2 debut next year, and since launch, Silksong has sold over seven million copies. </p>



<p>After so much silence, followed by one very loud boom, to already know about Hollow Knight Silksong DLC, and to be hearing so much about what's coming for both Hollow Knight games, doesn't feel right. It's exciting, though, particularly because you can't imagine that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">would take seven years on a project that is initially meant to be just an expansion again.</a> At least not with back-to-back games, right?</p>



<p>That means Sea of Sorrow will arrive in 2026, barring any delays. The initial teaser trailer doesn't showcase any gameplay, unfortunately, but it does feature more of the game's excellent art, and it's an exciting proposition to be getting a more water-based area.</p>



<p>"<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow is coming in 2026!</em>" the teaser's description reads. "<em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players.</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>With Hollow Knight: Silksong’s launch year coming to a close, we wanted to take a moment and share a peek at what we’ve been working on, what’s available now, and what’s coming in 2026</em>," Team Cherry began in a blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>But firstly, and most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands. That’s over seven million of you who’ve purchased the game, alongside millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass!</em> <em>It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further. That first big expansion is already well underway!</em>"</p>



<p>The blog post goes on to confirm that the "<em>nautically themed expansion</em>" will feature "<em>new areas, bosses, tools, and more</em>." Team Cherry says it'll reveal more about Sea of Sorrow "<em>shortly before</em>" its release date next year.</p>



<p>As for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight, this new version will include: "<em>all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: High frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects</em>," and, like the update between the Switch and Switch 2 version of Silksong, be entirely free.</p>



<p>If you have the game on PC on Steam or GOG, you can check out the new changes now through a public beta branch that's now live. It also includes support for 16:10 and 21:9 monitors, so players with an ultrawide screen can take advantage of the update right away if they like.</p>



<p>Silksong launched this past September, and since its arrival, it's been one of the biggest games this year. We already knew that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-thinking-about-non-hollow-knight-games/">was working on DLC</a>, but it's even more exciting to know that we can all ring in the new year knowing that we'll be able to check it out sooner than later.</p>
