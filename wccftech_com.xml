			<p>Earlier this month, The Molasses Flood (The Flame in the Flood, Drake Hollow, and the work-in-progress Project Sirius) was officially dissolved following its merger into CD Projekt RED. The Boston-based game development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired</a> on October 22, 2021, but the merger did not happen until April 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Molasses Flood co-founder Daniel Isla, who has now departed from the studio for a new adventure, talked about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315404560620044288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>, where he also teased Project Sirius, which he described as an 'amazing' The Witcher multiplayer game.</p>
<p><em>To be ultra clear: this is a GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio, and it was long-expected. It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org. Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on.</em></p>
<p><em>On the sadder side -- not to bury the lede -- I've decided not to follow TMF on this transition. So last Monday -- the last day of TMF's legal existence! -- was also my last day at the studio.</em></p>
<p>We don't know a lot about this game, although a few job ads from a couple of years ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-stylized-action-pve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that it would feature stylized visuals, action combat, PvE content, and cooperative elements. Project Sirius was, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> in March 2023, when CD Projekt RED said it would formulate a new 'framework' for the project. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-finalizes-its-new-framework-some-work-seemingly-salvaged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that something might have been salvaged out of the previous work, so everything that Isla and his team have worked on could eventually come to fruition, although we have no idea when.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-renewed-for-season-3-days-before-season-2-premieres/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-hbo-1236364271/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a> has been renewed for season 3 just a few days ahead of the season 2 premiere this coming Sunday, April 13, 2025. The news doesn't come as a total shock, considering how often showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have talked about needing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">least three, potentially four seasons</a>, to tell the whole story of The Last of Us Part II.</p>
<p>Realistically, we won't know how plausible a fourth season will be until we reach the end of season 2, and see how far along into the story of The Last of Us Part II this season takes us. But if a fourth season is needed, HBO sounds likely to grant it, with the executive vice president of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, Francesca Orsi, expressing every confidence in Mazin, Druckmann, and the entire creative team behind the series.</p>
<p>"<em>It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,</em>" Orsi said in a statement. "<em>Craig, Neil, Carolyn [Strauss] and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season."</em></p>
<p>In a separate statement, Druckmann expressed his gratitude to fans for their positive reaction and credited Mazin with playing a huge role in the adaptation's success.</p>
<p>"<em>To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions [...] We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!</em>"</p>
<p>For his own part, Mazin added that season 2 has "<em>exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew.</em>"</p>
<p>Just because we're getting a third season, though, doesn't mean a fourth will follow. Mazin previously said in an interview that he will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/">"<em>flat out</em>"</a> not go beyond the plot of the games, and if that means only needing three seasons, then that's what it means. According to Mazin, only if a fourth season is needed will it happen.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 would be featured in a Direct-style presentation immediately following the Xbox Summer Showcase slated for June 8. However, fans of the game were also treated to a surprise: IGN published the first gameplay video, and more coverage can be expected throughout April as part of IGN First.</p>
<p>The footage sees the player character infiltrating an N-Ray facility with the help of a slightly crazed cultist companion. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN</a>, the game features a full-fledged stealth system. Enemies can detect bodies and alert fellow guards, though players obviously have ways to prevent that from happening, including a skill that can disintegrate bodies as soon as they drop.</p>
<p>There are also more effective melee weapons and abilities to perform silent takedowns. Moreover, Obsidian introduced an easy way for players to gauge how much they're going to take out of the enemy's health with a stealth attack, so that they can assess whether a one-hit kill is even possible in the first place.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: 11 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhDvnM3wBaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>New gadgets are being used to spruce up the gameplay variety. In this mission, the N-Ray Scanner allows the player character to spot otherwise invisible cultists. Gunplay also seems improved in The Outer Worlds 2 compared to the first installment, with the developers claiming to have taken inspiration from Bungie's Destiny in that regard.</p>
<p>Movement was also fine-tuned to allow for greater agility, not to mention the addition of a sprint-slide move while aiming down sights. The Bullet-Time-like Tactical Time Dilation returns, and in the footage, we can see the main character tossing a grenade, activating Tactical Time Dilation, and shooting the grenade to have it explode on multiple enemies.</p>
<p>IGN also said that Obsidian mentioned having Fallout: New Vegas as the main inspiration for this sequel. The footage does hint at some of that when, all of a sudden, the player takes down a non-hostile character that had actually provided them with help (and could have been saved if provided with a trauma kit). It looks like there will be a lot of choices and consequences.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
