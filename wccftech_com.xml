			<p><strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> have released the latest patch notes for the next update coming to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>, numbered <strong>Update 1.1.3.5,</strong> which aims to bring a bit more "<em>polish and consistency</em>" to the game, with refinements to melee attacks, movement, jet combat, and more.</p>



<p>"<em>With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6</em>," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-5">a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a> detailing the changes in the update reads. "<em>This update enhances melee responsiveness, refines jet combat, improves ladder interactions, and resolves UI and HUD issues in Multiplayer and REDSEC, alongside fixes for Battle Royale and Gauntlet stability</em>."</p>



<p>It's not the biggest update in terms of scale, but it does include several significant updates, like fixing a bug that could see a vehicle explode if an enemy player lay on top of it and performed a Takedown, and a major reduction in jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, which brings a huge balance to the game's air combat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable improvements include the attack speed for knife attacks being faster, and improvements to the buffering behaviour for both knife and sledgehammer attacks. More consistent behaviour for recoil modifiers when using a controller, and perhaps the one that players will notice the most: sprinting will now only be interrupted when your melee attack reaches its target, instead of what would happen before, where you would sprint towards your enemy, only to have your sprint interrupted just before you were in range because you pressed the melee button.</p>



<p>This update and its fixes will be live next week on <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>, so you still have to play through the weekend before they're implemented. It's also the first update the game is getting since EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed that the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/"><strong>Season 2</strong> would be delayed and pushed to <strong>February 17, 2026,</strong></a> which means players still have another month to wait before any new content, including new maps, weapons, and vehicles, is added to the game. </p>

			<p>Amazon is having a busy week for its TV series adaptations of video games. On top of showing off our first look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a></strong> and confirming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show-confirmed/">rumoured <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>-based reality competition show to be real</a>, it also confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who played Thor in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, would be playing <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Now, we have our latest cast member for the God of War series, with Warm Bodies star <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/">Deadline</a>, and arrives just one day after Hurst was named as Kratos for the show. The series is reportedly set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, and if that is still the case, then we'll likely start to see more casting announcements as we get closer to the series kicking off production.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to note about this casting announcement is that it gives us more insight into the approach the show is taking with the story. We already knew that this series wouldn't be addressing Kratos' story from the original set of Greek mythology-based games, and that it would be jumping right into the Norse era.</p>



<p>But now that we know the show will include Sif, who players will remember is a Norse goddess in her own right and the wife of <strong>Thor</strong>, we know that the show is pulling from both the 2018 God of War and Ragnarok. Sif doesn't appear in Ragnarok, so now at least know whatever version of Kratos and Atreus' story we get in this show, it'll involve more than just the few Norse gods we meet in the first game.</p>



<p>The series is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>,</a> who took over as showrunner after PlayStation Productions scrapped the initial version of the show over creative differences with its previous leads. The first couple of episodes will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">directed by Shogun director, <strong>Frederick E.O. Toye</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and hopefully, we'll have more official news about the series, and when we'll get our first look of it soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Having Your Game Be Free on Epic Is Great Advertising for Steam Sales” Says Indie Pub After Blood West Sales Spiked While it Was Free on EGS]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/</link>

			<p><strong>New Blood Interactive </strong>co-founder and chief executive officer <strong>Dave Oshry</strong> has made a name for himself, not just as the head of the indie publisher, but on the <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry">social media platform X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he often shares his thoughts and sometimes industry insights. Today, we have the latter, as Oshry revealed the latest example of how much people <strong>hate using the Epic Games Store</strong> and would much rather use <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>In response to a meme video about how players would rather pay for a game on Steam than grab it for free off the Epic Games Store, Oshry offered a real-life example of the scenario the meme was poking fun at.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/">Blood West</a></strong> is an indie first-person shooter published by New Blood Interactive, and it was also one of the games that was given away <strong>for free on the Epic Games Store</strong> during Epic's annual holiday giveaway period, where it gives away one free game per day leading up to the new year. Blood West <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">was free for December 20, 2025</a>, and by the time the giveaway promotion had ended, it was one of the <strong>20 games</strong> that contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">Epic saving players from spending <strong>$550 </strong>if they wanted to purchase all 20 games at their full, non-sale price</a>.</p>



<p>(Speaking of free games on the Epic Games Store, as a quick aside, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/">you can currently get <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong> and <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong> for free on the store</a>.)</p>



<p>But that doesn't matter to players, because they're not using the Epic Games Store anyway. They're using Steam, and when given the chance to buy a game on sale on Steam or get it for free on the Epic Games Store, they'd rather buy it on Steam. </p>



<p>"<em>Blood West was free on EGS over the holidays and sold like 200% more on Steam that day</em>," Oshry wrote in response to the meme post. "<em>I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oshry continued to explain that when a game is made free on the Epic Games Store, Epic offers developers a lump-sum royalty payment for the period it's available for free, all of which went directly to Blood West's developer, <strong>Hyperstrange</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>New Blood doesn't get any royalties from EGS we let Hyperstrange take 100% of that - so they got the $$$ bag for the free giveaway, are putting that money into developing the new DLC and we got more Steam sales too</em>," Oshry said. In response to another user, Oshry revealed he had conducted an interview earlier in the day, where he said, "<em>Epic could give devs 100% of sales and it doesn't mean shit if there's no sales lol. WHAT'S 100% OF $0</em>."</p>



<p>Back in December, while Epic was in the middle of its end-of-year giveaways,<a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/"> <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> put it bluntly, and perhaps best:</a> "<em></em><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community</em>." Oshry's example today is just the latest to make it clear that players are choosing to stick with their communities. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Foundry Confirms Monster Hunter Wilds PC Performs ‘Thousands’ of DLC Checks That Hurt Performance, But Only in Certain Conditions]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/</link>
            <guid>1408549</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that one of the reasons <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds PC</strong> players may encounter unexpected frame rate drops is that the game checks for DLC ownership, and <strong>the less DLC you own, the worse the frame rate is going to be.</strong> That can be a problem, especially since there are dozens of cosmetic DLCs. Thankfully, after modder de_Tylmarande found this out, a fix was quickly deployed by Nexus Mods user Vaeux <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the so-called '<strong>Less DLC Checks</strong>' mod</a>. The mod requires praydog's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-modding-tool-reframework-updated-to-work-with-sunbreak-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REFramework</a></strong>, which improves and fixes various issues in <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s games built with the <strong>RE Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has investigated the issue</a> and discovered that the user's computer is indeed being hammered by <strong>'thousands' of DLC checks</strong>, which are lowering the frame rate. However, <strong>this only happens in a specific scenario</strong>: when your character is in a hub zone and one of the Support Desk felyne characters is nearby. That's because those NPCs handle the DLC menu.</p>



<p>Still, the modder's claim under said conditions is perfectly valid. Using a <strong>Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</strong> test system, the testing performed by Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter discovered that the performance boost granted by the Less DLC Checks mod got higher when the graphics settings were lowered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Maxed settings (1440p ultra, RT, DLSS balanced):</strong>&nbsp;11.4% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>High settings with RT:</strong>&nbsp;20% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>Lowest settings (DLSS ultra performance, no RT):</strong>&nbsp;25.6% performance improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The good news is that this issue only really affects the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance in the aforementioned conditions. That said, CAPCOM should absolutely fix it as soon as possible, and in a way, it's wild that a user discovered it almost a year after the game's original release.</p>
