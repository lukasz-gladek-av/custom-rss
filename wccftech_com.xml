			<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> announced it had voted for wall-to-wall union representation</a> under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/"><strong>CWA Canada</strong>,</a> with <strong>61</strong> of the studio's <strong>71</strong> employees joining <strong>Local 30111 </strong>alongside <strong><a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a></strong>. Not even three weeks later, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>shutting down the studio and laying off all 71 workers</strong></a>, denying that the shutdown had anything to do with the majority of its staff unionizing.</p>



<p>In response, the CWA Canada said it would "<em></em><em>pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way</em>." That process has seemingly begun, as the media union has <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/13/union-files-labour-board-complaint-over-ubisoft-halifax-shutdown/">filed an official complaint with the <strong>Nova Scotia Labour Board</strong></a> over the closure, and today, the union expressed further outrage after learning that Ubisoft was given <strong>nearly $1 billion CAD in tax credit subsidies</strong> in the last five years alone while operating in Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>Provincial and state governments will often offer companies tax breaks as incentives to establish a base of operations in their state or province, and in the case of Ubisoft, the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> company has quite the history of taking advantage of these breaks to establish what have become some of its most important offices. </p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft Montreal</strong>, for example, was first set up due to Quebec having attractive tax incentives. If not for those incentives driving Ubisoft to open a studio in Montreal, the city may not have grown into the incredible hub of game development it is today, with scores of talented developers calling Montreal their home.</p>



<p>While Halifax hasn't grown as a game development hub in the same way that Montreal did, as CWA Canada president Carmel Smyth pointed out when the union filed its complaint, "<em>Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry. Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology</em>."</p>



<p>Once the union dug through French Senate documents to see just how much of a tax break the company was receiving, it not only found that Ubisoft had received more tax breaks from Canada than any other country, but also that in the last five years, it had received hundreds of millions in tax credits.</p>



<p>"<em>According to the documents, Ubisoft got 605.6 million Euros (about C$980 million at today’s exchange rates) in tax credits from Canadian governments from 2020 through 2024</em>," CWA Canada writes in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s outrageous that a company can take hundreds of millions in tax breaks – public money – and then shut down an operation and lay off workers</em>," added Smyth. "<em>And it’s shocking that governments allow it to happen</em>. <em>We need immediate changes to hold companies to account. The rules must make it clear that if you close or significantly downsize a business, you must pay back any government subsidies.</em>"</p>



<p>CWA Canada is also holding to its accusation that Ubisoft shut down the Halifax studio "<em>to keep out the union</em>." While Ubisoft denies that the shutdown had anything to do with the studio unionizing, CWA Canada notes that if the shutdown had been planned as Ubisoft claims, it wouldn't have caught the staff entirely by surprise as it did, and that Ubisoft has yet to provide evidence proving the shutdown was a decision made through "<em>financial necessity</em>."</p>



<p>Since the shutdown was announced, legal and public pressure from the CWA Canada has already pushed Ubisoft to <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/12/ubisoft-agrees-to-reconsider-compensation-for-laid-off-halifax-workers-amid-union-public-pressure/">consider raising the severance offered to the 71 workers laid off from the Halifax studio</a>. While that may be all the union is able to get out of this, the pressure applied here, specifically regarding how Canada and its provincial governments approach tax incentives, could create significant change down the line.</p>

			<p>American indie developer and publisher ProbablyMonsters released their first game, Storm Lancers, on Nintendo Switch 2 (and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store) last month after an earlier debut on Nintendo Switch in September 2025. The game is priced at $19.99, and existing Nintendo Switch users can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p>



<p>We've sent a list of questions to the team focused on the recent launch and the studio as a whole. In their answers, they described Nintendo's new platform as <strong>the perfect home for their Storm Lancers game</strong>, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GameShare</strong> feature</a>. The team also revealed that while they are open to using AI tools for 'assisting with administrative work' and 'automating repetitive technical tasks', their games are made 'by people, for people' and <strong>do not use AI for asset creation or creative decisions</strong>. Scroll down to read their replies in full.</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about ProbablyMonsters?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ProbablyMonsters is an independent game publisher and developer focused on building a better way to make games and build careers in games. With offices in Fort Worth, TX and Bellevue, WA, <strong>our team of AAA industry veterans is built with a unique structure that allows us to develop multiple games of different scales at the same time.</strong> We are committed to developing and releasing multiple high-quality PC and console titles each year, which we started last year with our debut titles Storm Lancers and Ire: A Prologue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Can you introduce us to your recently released game, Storm Lancers?</strong></p>



<p>Storm Lancers is an <strong>action rogue-like</strong> that combines <strong>retro 80’s aesthetics</strong> with intense combat, while introducing a new twist to the fan-favorite rogue-like genre: <strong>couch co-op</strong>. After you and a friend crash-land on a dying alien world with unstable magic, you work together to unleash new powers, carve through evolving hordes, and grow even stronger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can be played solo, Storm Lancers was designed with two player co-op in mind and <strong>utilizes GameShare on Nintendo Switch 2 and Remote Play Together on Steam</strong> to allow players to partner up even if only one of them owns a copy of the game. Adding co-op into a rogue-like was a fun and exciting challenge for our development team, and we hope players have enjoyed becoming true legends of Cryptica together.</p>



<p><strong>What was the reaction so far? Is there any early feedback from the community that you can address here already? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The reaction to Storm Lancers has been positive overall, and players are fans of our two-player co-op feature, the game’s vibrant art style, and its responsive controls. As Storm Lancers is our first title, we built it at a more limited size and scope to help us get our feet wet, and we’ve received some feedback that people wish there was more of the game to play. In our minds, this is great feedback because it signals that players resonate with the experience we’ve created and are really having fun, which was our primary goal with Storm Lancers.</p>



<p>We have also heard that some players are experiencing performance issues in the recently released Steam version of the game, and we are hard at work on a patch to address these. This will be released in the next few weeks so keep an eye on Discord and X for the patch announcement.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you choose Nintendo's platforms as the first consoles to get Storm Lancers? Do you plan to launch it on PlayStation and/or Xbox later?</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has been a great partner for us, and <strong>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 are the perfect home for a co-op title that players can enjoy at home or on the go.</strong> We made a conscious decision early on to build Storm Lancers so that it could be played with a single Joy-Con controller, which makes it as easy as possible for players to bring a friend along for the adventure. Nintendo offered us an opportunity to be featured back in their Nintendo Direct presentation last September, which was the perfect place to stealth-launch the title.</p>



<p><strong>We do not currently have plans to launch Storm Lancers on PlayStation or Xbox consoles</strong> and will let our fans know if this changes. Our primary focus is growing our audience on Steam and supporting the Nintendo of Europe release of the Switch 2 version on January 22nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I understand Storm Lancers supports the GameShare feature. What do you think of it, and why is it so important for your game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We built Storm Lancers to truly shine in co-op, and <strong>GameShare gives us a unique path to building a couch co-op like experience for players who live apart</strong>. Being able to see the same screen and play on the same copy of the game creates a truly seamless experience, and so we were excited when we first saw Nintendo’s announcement of the new feature. As players, <strong>we think it offers massive value for households and friends who want to play together</strong>, and as a self-publisher, we see GameShare as a great tool for helping us promote Storm Lancers organically.</p>



<p><strong>Was it hard to implement GameShare? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Implementing GameShare into Storm Lancers was very easy, and our small but mighty engineering team was able to get it fully implemented and released in just over a month. The tech is incredible, and it is a great, quick solution to building online multiplayer capabilities without developing new features from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond GameShare, what do you think of the Switch 2 as a whole? Does this version offer any noticeable improvements over the Switch 1?</strong></p>



<p>We at ProbablyMonsters are big fans of Nintendo Switch 2 and are excited that the more powerful hardware will allow us to be more ambitious with the art pipelines, performance, and fidelity of our games. Seeing Storm Lancers in 4K resolution with 60FPS performance was truly something special, and we’re happy that Nintendo Switch 2 lets us experience that.</p>



<p><strong>The Switch 2's HDR feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has often been criticized</a>. Do you think that's fair?</strong></p>



<p>We have seen criticisms of HDR on Nintendo Switch 2, but from a development perspective, we never encountered any issues working with it and think Storm Lancers looks awesome with the expanded range of colors. Consumers always have a right to criticize the technology they purchase when it does not work as intended or live up to their expectations, but that feedback is for them to provide. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You also launched another game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547420/Ire_A_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ire: A Prologue</a> in October. That's a very different, horror-inspired experience. Are you going to build upon it to deliver a full-fledged horror game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>As a small developer, what is your policy on AI usage in game development? Do you believe we're going toward a future where it is inevitable?</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>Ori series developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/">Moon Studios</a></strong> has just released a new gameplay trailer for its action RPG currently in early access, <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>. The title is due to receive a major update a little more than a week from the time of this writing with its <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> update, officially adding <strong>co-op</strong> to the game.</p>



<p>Players could have already tried the update while it was in <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-updates-launches-january-22-2026/">beta for a weekend at the end of 2025</a>, but starting next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> it'll be live for all players. This new update"<em>reimagines traditional co-op multiplayer play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS," </em>writes Moon Studios in a press release<em>, "allowing up to <strong>four players </strong>to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked Together | Co-op | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmTU-DbFOd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All four players get to share the rewards they earn from combat, while enemies will react differently when you have three friends on your side, all trying to corner them. You'll also be able to work with your friends outside of combat as well, as you can share and build housing, fish, and seemingly experience the whole game with three of your friends by your side.</p>



<p>The 'Together' update is the first major update of 2026 for No Rest for the Wicked, which launched in early access nearly two years ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">April 18, 2024</a>.</strong> There's currently no exact timeline for when the game will hit its <strong>1.0 launch</strong>, but speculation from players does point to it potentially arriving sometime in 2026. We'll see how the year goes for Moon Studios, though, with co-op due to arrive in the game soon, it does seem like the community could be right with its 2026 guess.</p>
