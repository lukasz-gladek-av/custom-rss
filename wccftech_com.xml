			<p>It's well known that user reviews on <strong>Steam</strong> are a mixed bag, to say the least. You'll get everything from actually thoughtful reviews to snap reactions based on less than an hour spent with the game, and often see a slew of negative reviews that are clearly part of a review-bombing campaign of players complaining about a singular issue, regardless of that issue factoring in on the game's quality.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/16/bigotry-steam-pc-moderation-developers-speak-out">The Guardian</a> delves into another aspect of Steam's user reviews and forums, with developers and even some content creators speaking out about the <strong>abuse</strong> and <strong>bigotry</strong> that <strong>Valve</strong> allows to run rampant on the platform, despite several statements directly violating content guidelines set by Valve.</p>



<p>More than calling out the content itself, the issue developers and creators have is Valve's apparent unwillingness to do anything about it, offering little to no support, even with reviews that violate their own content guidelines. </p>



<p>One example included in the report describes how game designer <strong>Nathalie Lawhead</strong> wasn't able to get reviews with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3mbgpbpewsc2i">antisemitic comments that also mocked allegations she made regarding her sexual assault</a>, without using her public following, and ultimately, had to step outside the moderation process by directly asking someone they knew at Valve to remove the reviews.</p>



<p>Valve's moderators had cleared both reviews after Lawhead initially reported them, which prevented Lawhead from reporting them a second time, since developers cannot report a cleared review without the author editing it. The reviews were also cleared despite Valve's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B">user-generated content</a> and online <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct">content guides</a> citing "<em>insults or harassment</em>," "<em>discrimination</em>," and "<em>public accusations towards others</em>" as examples of what not to do in user reviews. </p>



<p>Lawhead was able to remove the antisemitic review, while the other, which, like its antisemitic counterpart, accused Lawhead of lying about their sexual assault, cleared moderation even after it had been reported by others. It was then that Lawhead was able to get it removed after speaking with someone they knew at Valve. Before Lawhead took that route, all Valve said in response to their report was "<em>We aren't in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews</em>," with Valve adding, "<em>we don't try to moderate reviews based on accuracy</em>," and claiming it was against removing reviews as it could be seen as "<em>censorship</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone is at one another's throats all the time in reviews</em>," said content creator Bri 'BlondePizza' Moore. "<em>It ensures<strong> no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike</strong></em>." For Lawhead's part, getting the response they got from Valve was "<em>crushing,</em>" adding, "<em>the implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it. I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It's an obvious stance. It's a choice</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews</em>," Lawhead added. "<em>I think this entire process of moderation is <strong>broken</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another example shared in the report describes how another developer, who did not have the kind of public following Lawhead did to fall back on, was unsuccessful in getting user reviews removed that had nothing to do with their game, and everything to do with whether the developer properly observed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year.</p>



<p>Their game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785940/COVEN/">Coven</a></strong>, is a first-person shooter and action game described as a "<em>hyper-violent retro FPS</em>," and it has also been targeted by a Steam curator, '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915">CharlieTweetsDetected,</a>' which recommends games based solely on whether the developer has posted something negative or not about Charlie Kirk's death. The developer, who wished only to be identified as Ethan, said that Steam was not interested or didn't seeminigly care that several of Coven's negative reviews stemmed from the curator list.</p>



<p>"<em>For sure, the 'anti-woke' curators brought insincere negative attention to the game</em>," says <strong>Émi Lefèvre</strong>, a developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/">Caravan SandWitch</a></strong>, a game that has several negative reviews that call it "<em>too LGBTQ...there is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians</em>."</p>



<p>Lefèvre continues, "<em>Valve's refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalized people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought</em>."</p>



<p>One developer who tried to report transphobic reviews to Steam was told they should "<em>continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed</em>," language that was exactly similar to what Lawhead was told five years prior, showing no change or growth in its process in half a decade.</p>



<p>"<em>To us, it seemed that in Steam's [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse - but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that's welcome speech,</em>" said Phi, who received the above response when trying to remove transphobic reviews from their game. "<em>We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They're still up there today</em>."</p>



<p>Lawhead concluded, "<em>If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse. <strong>This shouldn't be normal.</strong></em><strong>"</strong></p>



<p>Valve's apparent unwillingness to moderate these reviews or even update its moderation process is only compounded as a problem when you consider that Steam is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/">largest digital platform for PC games</a>, one that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-majority-of-game-developers-believe-steam-has-monopoly-on-pc-game-distribution/">many developers believe to be a monopoly</a>. Beyond the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">economic issues this causes</a>, developers are forced to choose between publishing their games on platforms where Lawhead admits game publishers "<em>don't take you seriously</em>" because you're not on Steam, or stay on Steam, and endure reams of abuse. </p>

			<p>Last month, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios </strong>announced that the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, would be making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">console debut on February 26, 2026</a><strong>.</strong> Now, less than three weeks after that announcement, the studio has confirmed that ICARUS: Console Edition has been delayed by <strong>one month</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles on <strong>March 26, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>In a statement sent to Wccftech, the studio says that while the game is "<em>in a strong and stable state</em>," the delay will add enough time for the team to add further polish, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>After careful consideration, we've decided to move the release date to Thursday, March 26,</em>" the studio begins in its statement. "<em>This additional month will allow us to polish the gameplay and ensure the best possible launch."</em></p>



<p>"<em>While the game is in a strong and stable state, we've identified a few areas that need further refinement. Rather than launch with known issues, we believe taking these extra weeks is the right decision for the game and players. Our team is fully focused on polishing the experience and game content to ensure it plays as intended across Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Thank you for sticking with us, we're looking forward to welcoming you to Icarus soon</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the announcement of the delay, RocketWerkz has also revealed that it will host an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/">AMA session in the r/SurvivalGaming Reddit tomorrow</a>, Tuesday, February 17, beginning at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>, to give players a chance to ask any and all questions they have about the console edition, the delay, and anything else ICARUS-related.</p>



<p>The upcoming console edition will include the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and if you pre-order the Console Edition, you'll also receive the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>. On top of the base game, this gives those new to ICARUS plenty to dive into when it arrives on consoles next month.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Preview – Is An Emphasis on LTMs Enough to Reinvigorate EA’s 2025 Hit in 2026?]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> launched in October 2025, I couldn't help but be enamoured with it. I have years of memories in previous Battlefield games, and I was happy to see the series return with a very solid military shooter. It was, for the most part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">exactly what I wanted</a> out of a modern Battlefield game.</p>



<p>I was one of the millions of players jumping into Battlefield 6 constantly during those opening weeks, especially with the arrival of <strong>Season 1</strong>, with three new maps, the new battle royale <strong>REDSEC</strong> mode, and new weapons, gadgets, and vehicles to earn. I was also one of the players who found the stretch between each phase, and the new content that came with it, to be coming at a slower pace than what I would've liked.</p>



<p>Which wouldn't have been too much of an issue if the progression system through the battle pass and unlocking new weapons and accessories wasn't also extremely slow. Thankfully, that's something EA has already been clear <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-looking-ahead-to-season-2">it'll look to address</a> in Season 2, but whether it'll actually be better tuned this time is something we won't know until we're into the full swing of Season 2 when it arrives on <strong>February 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>So while I can't talk about most of the retooling that EA and Battlefield Studios have done for Season 2, after spending two hours playing Conquest and Escalation on the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, I can talk a bit about what Season 2 has in store.</p>



<p><em><strong>For more on Battlefield 6 Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown</a> of everything coming from last week's full reveal.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-impressions">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Impressions</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reiterate, all I got to play from Season 2 was the new Contaminated map. We weren't given the chance to check out the new <strong>Hagental Base</strong> map, the new <strong>Nightfall</strong> mode, or <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, which are all set to arrive later in the season. So these impressions will just be focused on the Contaminated map and some of the weapons arriving in the Extreme Measures phase of Season 2. I specify just the weapons because I unfortunately didn't get a chance to check out Little Bird. Unlucky respawns meant I didn't get a chance to grab it before someone else, and with only a couple of rounds played across the two hours, I was grounded for the whole session. </p>



<p>For what I did get my hands on: starting with the Contaminated map, which honestly felt like a pretty bog-standard Battlefield map. It's got a couple of great interest points that make for good concentrated battles, but unlike my first impressions of Blackwell Fields and Eastwood, I didn't feel there was anything separating Contaminated from the rest of the pack of maps already available in Battlefield 6. It's a slightly different flavour of maps like Mirak Valley, which isn't the worst thing to be, but it also doesn't make for an exciting first new map since November 18, when Eastwood launched.</p>



<p>What's more exciting about the Contaminated map is something that doesn't directly relate to the map at all. The introduction of the <strong>VL-7 </strong>hallucinogenic smoke is probably my favourite new feature added with this new season. It's not a survival layer because the gas itself doesn't do damage to you if you're running in it without a gas mask, but it will make you see things that aren't there almost immediately if you don't have a gas mask on.</p>



<p>It makes for more interesting close-quarters combat and is another gameplay layer that I would welcome on every other map. It's a shame that, at least for now, it only features on Contaminated in multiplayer and on Fort Lyndon in Guantlet. I understand that it's only on those maps for narrative reasons at the moment, but I would love to see it used more liberally and add that layer to other game modes. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>I know some might find it annoying to deal with, but I think the VL-7 gas will make for more chaotic and engaging fights.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures, the new DMR, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a solid addition and will probably be my new choice of DMR, but my appreciation for it was outweighed by my lack of appreciation for the new assault rifle, the <strong>VCR-2</strong>.</p>



<p>My hope would be that it gets tuned in an upcoming patch, because it felt absolutely useless in the few rounds I tried it. I should say again that I only had two hours to check everything out, which doesn't leave a lot of time to get stuck in menus trying out different attachments. I went with the default layout, swapping to a couple of its different pre-determined builds, but nothing seemed to help. I'll add one more caveat that, because I was playing a build that was flagged as a "<em>work-in-progress build</em>," there could be a bug causing the weapon to do less damage than it should. Again, I would hope that's the case, but as someone who enjoys playing as the Assault class and utilizing an array of assault rifles, it flat out sucks to see the newest one be as useless as this.</p>



<p>I did, however, quite enjoy using the new <strong>M121 A2</strong> belt-fed LMG for the reps I had with it. Again, you can only get so much experience with everything in just two hours. But as Meatloaf always reminds me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s">two out of three ain't bad</a>, so I'd still call the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures to be an overall win.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-3-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Coming back to the question I asked in the title of this preview, could LTMs like the addition of VL-7 gas and the upcoming Nightfall mode and Operation Augur be enough to bring lapsed Battlefield 6 players like myself back to the game? It's possible, of course, but it'll depend on how quickly Battlefield Studios and EA are in responding to player feedback, especially if that feedback is similar to what I would offer, which is that the addition of features like the VL-7 gas should stick around and not be limited.</p>



<p>Regarding Nightfall, it'll also depend on whether the mode is executed in a similar fashion to the VL-7 gas, where it adds a fun layer of chaos or if it pushes further into the territory where it's frustrating to play through. And as for Operation Augur, frankly, that seems like it'll be the most fun by the time it comes around, which makes it even more disappointing for me that we didn't get a chance to try it out in this preview.</p>



<p>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</p>



<p>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Season 2 right now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“This Is Not God of War”: Original Creator Doesn’t Know “What the F***” SSM Was Thinking With New 2.5D Sons of Sparta Game]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, after a long period of silence following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">final piece of DLC</a> for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, during Sony's first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> of 2026, we finally got a small update as to what <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> has been working on. Along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">a remake of the original trilogy</a>, we learned that the studio had teamed up with <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong> to deliver a 2.5D game featuring Kratos titled <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong>.</p>



<p>There have been a lot of rumours circulating for years about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-is-reportedly-considered-for-a-multiplatform-release-day-one-on-pc-or-something-more/">upcoming 2.5D God of War game</a>, so its arrival was both surprising and not; surprising because after hearing nothing but rumours for a while, it was fair to wonder if it was even going to come out at all, and also not because we'd heard so much about it for so long.</p>



<p>Now that it was confirmed and shadow-dropped at the same time, we're starting to see plenty of reactions to the new 2.5D action game, one of which comes from <strong>David Jaffe</strong>, best known as one of the original creators behind the God of War franchise. To say that he's not fond of this new game would be an understatement.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God of War Creator REVIEWS Sons Of Sparta!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liEszJCMW-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em><strong>This is not God of War</strong></em>," an exasperated Jaffe says in his first of three videos he's now made on the game, the first of which you can see above. "<em>What were they [Sony Santa Monica] thinking, like what the f*** are they thinking?</em>" he continues, as he explains that he doesn't believe the game to be bad overall, calling it "<em>fine</em>," but adds that what he finds offensive in it is how generic the game is, and how he believes this is not the game that God of War fans would have wanted if you were to pitch them the idea of playing a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game in Sony's long-running franchise.</p>



<p>Jaffe adds that he doesn't believe anyone wants to play as "<em>kids</em>" in a God of War video game. "<em>Nobody wants to kids! We don't want to play as Atreus; we don't want a spin-off as Atreus. Why do you guys keep making games about 15-year-old boys? Leave me alone! Go to Epstein's Island or something, whatever the f*** it is, I don't know what they're doing, but leave me the f*** alone! I want to be Kratos motherf*****!"</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God Of War Sons Of Sparta NOT READY for release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClC7rCietLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though his first video can be described as an emotional rant fueled by only playing one hour of the game, in subsequent videos after playing a little more of Sons of Sparta, he digs further into his problems with it, citing issues of "<em>visual noise</em>" and an overall lack of polish, because while some people might call the probelms he's pointing out to be "<em>minor</em>," for him, not including even these 'minor' issues in the first place is "<em>what it means to make a first-party game</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Jaffe believes players wanted something closer to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-summer-2025-release/">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>,</strong> and <strong>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</strong>. A smooth, ultra-violent, 2.5D action game where players don't play as a younger, prequel-era Kratos, but as the Ghost of Sparta he was before he became the Kratos we know from the Norse-era games. He adds that if you were to "<em>pull God of War</em>," as in remove the well-known IP from the game and present it as a 2.5D action game about a young Spartan, people would not be interested in playing it.</p>



<p>He's also butting up against the studio's shift in priorities to be more driven by storytelling, instead of the action gameplay that drove the original trilogy. </p>



<p>"<em>It [Sons of Sparta] reminds me of a conversation I had with someone that is no longer at Sony Santa Monica, when</em> <em>we were talking about the sequence in God of War Ragnarok that a lot of people complain about, which is where Atreus is going on that long sled, walk, whatever, with that girl he likes and it just goes on and on and on. And I said to this person, 'Why didn't they recognize, didn't focus tests tell them that this was boring and they should maybe cut that or truncate it?'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>And they said to me - and this is one person's opinion, but they would know, they were certainly in the know. They said, 'Sony Santa Monica these days is driven mostly, or primarily, by story</em>.' <em>And I'm like, 'Oh my god.'</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IS Jaffe SALTY About God Of War?!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzruHkjMCfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jaffe also claims that anyone who says he is "<em>salty</em>" is wrong and that his only motive for talking about his displeasure with Sons of Sparta begins and ends with him just not liking the game. A statement that is difficult to take on its face, since Jaffe is primarily a content creator now, and all of these videos about his displeasure with the game are fueling what appears to be his main source of income.</p>
