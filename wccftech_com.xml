			<p>During yesterday's tinyBuild Connect 2025 show, developer Fire &amp; Frost shared a world overview trailer for their upcoming third-person open-world old-school RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-teams-up-with-fire-frost-studios-to-create-of-ash-and-steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Ash and Steel</a>. The trailer is narrated by Tristan, a cartographer who also happens to be the game's hero, albeit a bit casually. Moreover, signups for an upcoming playtest are now open on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. While the date hasn't been finalized yet, the developers said players will be able to experience a few of the quests and the story's beginning.</p>
<p>According to Fire &amp; Frost, Grayshaft, where Of Ash and Steel is set, is one of the seven islands that make up the Kingdom of the Seven. While filled with beautiful environments, such as peaceful meadows stretching alongside endless crop fields, thick, ancient forests soon take over the horizon, shrouding crumbling ruins and long-forgotten relics.</p>
<p>The locals describe the island as a living entity, temperamental and unstable. The weather can change in an instant, a gentle breeze turning into a violent storm in moments. While some parts of the island bloom with color and life, others remain frozen all year round. Not even the ancient volcano at the heart of the island can warm the lands it overlooks.</p>
<p>Danger lurks around every corner. Whether players wander well-trodden paths or venture down hidden trails, chances are they shall encounter bloodthirsty beasts, merciless scavengers, and monstrous creatures. Still, those who persevere will be rewarded: hidden caves, buried treasures, and long-lost secrets await the brave.</p>
<p>Wildlife, bandits, and monsters are not the only dangers on the island: Grayshaft is also home to factions, some of which are vying for control and power. The Order of the Seven is renowned for its code and discipline, while the Free Hunters answer only to their own sense of justice. Many more groups operate in the shadows or on the fringes of society, so players won't know who to trust at first glance.</p>

<p>Fire &amp; Frost previously revealed that Of Ash and Steel features over 300 quests and has over 30K lines of dialogue, not to mention 180+ weapons, 270+ armor/cloth/jewelry pieces, 30+ monsters, 200+ crafting recipes, 5 hours of completely original in-game soundtrack, and 80+ random world events.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is tentatively slated to launch for PC later this year. There's been no mention of other platforms yet.</p>

			<p>Those lucky enough to get a Nintendo Switch 2 before its official launch will only have a rather expensive paperweight on their hands until the system's day one update goes live, according to new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported by Wario64 on X following a short YouTube video featuring a quick unboxing of the system, which has since been removed but has been saved for posterity by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1927448039330894258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Crave</a>, a user who got an early unit of the console confirmed that the console cannot play any game, neither Switch 1 nor Switch 2 games, without downloading the day 1 update which cannot be done as of now, as the update function will not be available before June 5th, the day the system officially launches worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well. I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p>
<p>Needs update to boot a game <a href="https://t.co/18TU7Skk1D">pic.twitter.com/18TU7Skk1D</a></p>
<p>â€” Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Though disappointing, the Nintendo Switch 2 not being able to play any game before its official release date next week will have no impact on the popularity of a system that is rightly expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massive success</a>. Launching with the system on June 5th are plenty of games that will definitely contribute to the system's popularity, such as Mario Kart World, which will likely feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-reverse-track-mode/">reverse track mode</a> as suggested by some recent footage, and a slew of third-party developers ports such as Cyberpunk 2077, which is already showing well <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">before release</a> what the system is capable of, Hogwarts Legacy and a few others. The immediate future is also looking bright, with games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4: Echoes and others launching in 2026 and beyond, which may be able to deliver better visuals and performance by using more of the system resources than the launch window games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/">according to rumors</a>.</p>

			<p>A new version of the Dark Souls Re-Remastered visual overhaul mod is now available for download, introducing significant improvements in select locations.</p>
<p>The 1.27 version of the mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/642?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces new, higher resolution specular maps for most of Firelink Shrine, Undead Burg, and The Depths, significantly improving the visuals in these locations. To celebrate the release of the new version of the mod and the 100K downloads, the developer fromsoftserve shared a new video showcasing the improvements outlined above. You can check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="My Dark Souls Re-Remastered Mod Hits INSANE Milestone (+ ver 1.27!)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_GRCW-VXtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is being developed by the same developer who created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remastered Project</a>, a visual overhaul mod made possible by the impressive emulation improvements delivered by the ShadPS4 emulator, making the PlayStation 4 exclusive playable on PC. The mod adds dynamic shadows to every map, upscales almost every texture, generates new normal maps for most surfaces, better water reflections and distant geometry, adjusted depth of field, better ambient occlusion on the player lantern, and more.</p>
<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is compatible with the Remastered version of the first entry in the series created by FromSoftware released a while back on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

			<p>A new Oblivion Remastered mod now available for download makes the Imperial City more atmospheric and beautiful at night with the introduction of new light sources.</p>
<p>The Rabbit's Real Lights Imperial City, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2852?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces over 500 new hand-placed light sources and objects that provide better visibility at night and make the Imperial City more beautiful than ever. So far, new lights have been added to the Arena District, Elven Garden, Imperial Palace, Market District, Talos Plaza, Temple District, Arboretum, and Arcane District, leaving only the Prison District in its vanilla state. This mod is also fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumiere - Lights of Cyrodiil mod</a>, which adds light sources outdoors all over Cyrodiil, making the two mods complementary and a must-download for those looking to improve how the game looks at night.</p>

<p>Oblivion Remastered launched late last month after having been rumored to be in the works for a while. Powered by both Unreal Engine 5 and the original engine, the remaster is extremely faithful in terms of gameplay, making the experience instantly familiar to those who have already ventured into Cyrodiil, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Mario Kart World may feature a reverse track mode instead of a traditional mirror mode, judging from some gameplay footage recently shared online.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NintendoSoup</a>, one of the game's Japanese commercials features the Mario Bros. Circuit seen in previous footage of the game, but with some notable differences highlighted by the mini map, which is effectively reversed. While this reverse mode could be available in Knockout Tour or Versus mode, the in-game interface did not have elements of either mode, so there's a good chance playing tracks in reverse was revealed ahead of time with the new commercial.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World   NEW EXCLUSIVE JAPANESE Gameplay Footage Switch 2 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wuhtJfj54?start=51&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Kart World was revealed last month together with the Nintendo Switch 2, and it is set to become one of the most popular launch games for the next-generation system. Though revealed only recently, the game has been in development for a very long time, possibly even longer than most expected, as it was confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/">last week</a> that Mario Kart World has been in development since the launch of the original Switch. Its more open-ended formula was created to push the series formula after perfecting it with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the system launches worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>
