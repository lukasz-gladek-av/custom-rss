			<p>Hideo Kojima was as surprised as anyone learning this week that he was offered to develop a video game project based on the Matrix franchise, as no one ever told him such a conversation took place between the Wachowskis and Konami.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the legendary game designer and creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series clarified<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-creators-wanted-kojima-make-a-game-on-the-ip-konami-refused/"> the statements made a few days ago by Christopher Bergstresser</a>, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002. </p>



<p>In his post on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">X</a>, Kojima-san confirmed that, back in 1999, he and the Wachowskis exchanged emails as mutual fans, and later met when they traveled to Japan to promote the original Matrix movie for its Japanese release. Kojima-san believes he met them three times, but the offer never came up in any of the conversations he had during these meetings.</p>



<p>"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work,</em>" Hideo Kojima concluded.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a real shame a Matrix video game project developed by Hideo Kojima never came to be, if the offer had indeed been made, as it would have been a match made in even. Although the franchise's popularity is not what it was in the early 2000s, such a game project would have incredible potential even today, as none of the games based on the franchise have captured what makes it special.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation Portal handheld system may be about to get a highly-requested feature soon, judging from a PS App leak.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ohdvol/streaming_owned_games_imminent/">PlayStation Portal official subreddit</a>, user GetTheWetsOn shared a screenshot captured from the PS App of the Deliver at All Costs store page, which seemingly confirms that cloud streaming of purchased digital games could be coming to the PlayStation Portal for PS Plus Premium subscribers. The user also stated that the same confirmation, which has since been removed, could be found on the Dead Space remake store page.</p>



<p>While there's no indication this new PlayStation Portal streaming option is indeed coming, its confirmation on the store pages of two different games is unlikely to be a mistake, so there's a high chance it will eventually arrive on the system. </p>



<p>Ever since the system's release and its surprising popularity, Sony has repeatedly iterated that the company is looking into <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming/">expanding the system's functionality</a>. Allowing streaming of owned digital PlayStation games without having to download them first on their home system would be the perfect way to do so.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal is a Remote Play focused handheld device which launched back in 2023 worldwide. While not the successor of the PlayStation Vita many have been expecting for a long time, the system does what it does exceptionally well. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>
