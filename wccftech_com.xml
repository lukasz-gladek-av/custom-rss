			<p>With Grand Theft Auto VI, Rockstar Games has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior while offering players more freedom than before, according to a former developer of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTAVI-oclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTAVIoclock</a>, former game designer at Rockstar Games, commented on the next entry in the open-world series launching next year, saying that the developer has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior, which will blow everyone away and will be talked about many years after launch. The former developer also talked about mission design, saying that it will be what makes the game good, granting players freedom. As for the current state of the game, Grand Theft Auto VI is in the bug-fixing phase, so hopefully, it won't take much longer to see more of it.</p>

<p>It has been almost a year since we last saw Grand Theft Auto VI, thanks to its official announcement trailer, which provided a very quick look at the two protagonists and the state of Leonida, where Vice City is located. Since then, Rockstar Games has been pretty silent about the game, leaving plenty of room for rumors and speculation regarding its precise release date, which hasn't slipped to 2026 as of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">September</a>, leaving fans plenty of time to put together documents going over everything that is currently known about what will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, according to analysts.</a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It will be released sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-biggest-update-to-date-is-out-now-adding-new-npcs-animal-companions-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Enshrouded, Keen Games has been nonstop on adding quality-of-life changes to the game and major content updates for the title to keep it fresh in the Early Access period. When it comes to value for money, Enshrouded is undoubtedly it. Today, the fourth content update, Souls of the Frozen Frontier, is out and available. This is their biggest update yet and adds a ton of new content to explore, as well as bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. The full 1.0 launch of Enshrouded is edging ever closer, as the full release is planned for 2025 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. This title has been in Early Access since <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">January 2024</a>, and Keen Games is showing no signs of slowing down. If you are getting stuck into the latest update, there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of the new update, Keen Games has released two videos to show off the features, with one being a general trailer and the other being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK-BZdngOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature spotlight</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Souls of the Frozen Frontier | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PogZ1u9mGSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, there is now a new region to explore named the Albaneve Summits. Here, you'll get to experience the brand-new dynamic weather system, which will be featured throughout the entirety of Embervale and will take you through snowy tundras, ice plains, and plenty of new quests. The Summit is home to a lot of new monsters and creatures, as well as materials that you can bring back to your base and use for crafting.</p>
<p>For some, the most important things that are being added to Enshrouded are pets and farm animals. You can now have furry friends to keep you company at base. Anything non-aggressive can be tamed, and you can then help escort them back to your base. To make sure they're safe and happy, you can provide them with a home and some treats to keep them happy. If you are keeping farm animals, they will also drop resources that you can use every once in a while.</p>
<p>That's not all, as there are also new NPCs that you can find throughout Embervale, which can now be asked to return with you to your base to assist with crafting recipes and other tasks. Along with this comes new armor sets that you can equip to remain fashionable as you explore the expansive world of Enshrouded, with the player level cap now being increased to level 35 in the new update. This will allow you to access new spells, skills, and additional perks to help you survive the frozen areas of Embervale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-reckons-the-idea-of-an-exclusive-is-disappearing-altogether/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Final Fantasy XVI producer and Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida was recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/811/G081112/20241010055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Japanese website 4Gamer alongside series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to discuss the upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, which will be available next month on PC and consoles after an exclusive debut on Apple Arcade.</span></p>
<p>When asked whether he'd ever want to make a game for Apple's platform, Yoshida-san replied that in his mind, the idea of a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</p>
<p><em>Now the biggest gaming platform is the PC, and with the streaming boom, PC-based gamers are becoming mainstream. But on the other hand, smart devices are becoming a platform that everyone has for the younger generation. Given that, if possible, it would be better to make it playable on any platform rather than making it for a specific platform in order to reach a much larger audience. With that as a basic idea, I decide whether the game I'm trying to make will run properly on smart devices.</em><br>
<em>If the parts that can't be run are equal to the fun of the game, I'll give up on smart devices and make it fun. On the other hand, if it fits within the specs and can be played without the device getting too hot to touch, it's definitely better to make it for smart devices as well. In my mind, the idea of ​​a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI certainly suffered from that. It was only available on PlayStation 5 for over a year, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led</a> to weak sales, similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Now, Square Enix has largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to a multiplatform strategy that will take Xbox into much greater account. Yoshida reiterates the shift later in the aforementioned interview:</p>
<p><em>This time, we will also release the Xbox Series X|S version (of FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension) at the same time. In the future, Square Enix titles will be released simultaneously on each platform more and more, but since this is close to the first release, we would like Xbox users to play it as well.</em></p>
<p>Xbox fans are hoping Square Enix will eventually bring Final Fantasy XVI to their favorite platform, too, after the recent debut on PC.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Heroes series has quickly become a household name in JRPG since the release of the Trails in the Sky games, which offered not only extremely engaging stories but a level of worldbuilding that is hardly found in Japanese role-playing games. Despite some tweaks and changes to the formula originally introduced in the game starring Estelle and Joshua, the Trails series formula has seen its first major shakeup with Trails Through Daybreak, especially in regard to combat, introducing a field combat option that expanded the experience considerably and truly set the game apart from all its predecessors. Building upon the new features introduced in its predecessor, The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II may not seem to be as innovative, but this isn't going to make it a worse game. If anything, the refinement of features and mechanics, such as field combat, will possibly make the experience even more engaging.</p>
<p>During a press event hosted last week by NISA, I was able to check out the Western version of the latest entry in the Trails series ahead of its launch this coming February. Set three months after the events of Trails Through Daybreak, Van Arkride is informed by his old friend Elaine Auclair about the mysterious Crimson Grendel terrorizing Edith, who seems to be related to him in some way. At the same time, Swin and Nadia are in the capital of Calvard to find a certain someone, an apparently unrelated issue that will eventually link up with the other during the course of the game.</p>
<p>Bringing back the full team from the Arkride Solutions Office, Trails Through Daybreak II also sees the introduction of new characters and the return of others from previous entries in the series, including some fan favorites that haven't appeared in the series for a while. To give all of these characters their time to shine, the game takes a page from the Trails through Reverie's book, offering different viewpoint characters between chapters, which will also allow for an interesting combination of characters. Storytelling is further evolved by the introduction of a time factor which will see players travel back in time to explore different outcomes of different events. This, however, is only a storytelling twist and has no real impact on gameplay, so the narrative and gameplay flow of Trails Through Daybreak II won't be all that different from what we have seen in the past entries in the series.</p>

<p>Combat, on the other hand, has been enhanced significantly in Trails Through Daybreak II. In the previous game, field combat was a little on the simple side, but in the new entry in the series, characters are able to cast magic, do a Cross Charge attack with the proper timing and more. Generally, field combat feels snappier, more varied, and definitely more fun, further bridging the gap with Falcom's other mainstay series, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Ys series</a>. Command battle plays mostly the same as in the previous game, with player and enemy taking turns unleashing a variety of special attacks, but there have been improvements here as well, with an improved interface and better customization options with way more Drivers with different Arts layouts and New Holo Cores. Additionally, it will be possible to unleash flashy Dual Arts special attacks involving multiple characters that are as powerful as they look spectacular.</p>
<p>With the return of the Gourmet and LGC Alignment systems from the previous game thrown into the mix, Trails Through Daybreak II promises to feel like a familiar experience right from the beginning for those who completed the previous game. With returning characters from the Trails series as a whole, the upcoming game will also be better connected to the narrative at large, so it is definitely setting out to be a game that no fan of the Trials series who has played through most of them, if not all, should skip. Being the second entry of a new chapter in the bigger story, however, Trails Through Daybreak II won't be a good way to start exploring the Falcom franchise, as, while the game attempts to bring players up to speed regarding past events with an in-game glossary and a recap, it can never make up for the story and characters introduced in the past 11 games.</p>

<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II launches on February 14th on PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
