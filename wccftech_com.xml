			<p>Developing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S </a>version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was challenging due to the console's technical limitations, but optimizing the game for the system ultimately made the game better and more stable.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a>, Technical Director Christian Buhl commented on the challenges of developing the sixth entry in the series launching next month on the Microsoft system, saying that the biggest challenge was dealing with the console's limited memory, which was less than that of the studio's mid-spec PCs, and that caused crashing issues in a lot of the levels. Due to these issues, the team focused on optimizing memory usage in Battlefield 6, and these improvements were also applied to the other versions of the game, resulting in a better and more stable game. The specific optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version also didn't take a very long time, as the memory issues were reportedly fixed in one month or two, according to Buhl.</p>



<p>Although the Battlefield 6 developer managed to find an opportunity in the development challenges the Xbox Series S poses with its technical limitations compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S, many more developers have found these challenges to be a serious issue not easily solved. One of these developers is Saber Interactive, which hasn't managed to make the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/">Turok: Origins</a> run at 60 FPS on the system. Memory limitations were one of the reasons why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took a long time to release on Xbox systems. For the latter to launch on Xbox systems, Microsoft had to amend its parity clause and let Larian launch their games without split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S, which was later added to this version of the game with a patch.</p>

			<p>Games powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are likely held back by the system's CPU, and some engine updates, taking the system's specifications into account, will be required to implement some of the engine's trademark features on the console.</p>



<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tPvLuU_JxQ">Digital Foundry</a> take a look at the Unreal Engine 5-powered games now available on Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Fortnite, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, highlighting how all three games do not sport the engine's headline features like Lumen and Nanite. The fact that they are missing in Fortnite, in particular,  is rather telling, as it heavily suggests how the engine doesn't yet have a good preset to make an already released game run with these features at acceptable performance on Nintendo's new system. Having a high lower-level barrier to running high-level features like Lumen, Naninte and Virtual Shadow Maps, Cronos: The New Dawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">Borderlands 4</a>, which will only launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month, struggle to run smoohtly on a CPU like the Ryzen 5 3600, leading to a variety of issues, including traversal stuttering, which would be a lot worse on a slower CPU like the Switch 2's.</p>



<p>How the Nintendo Switch 2 CPU holds back Unreal Engine 5 games is made clearer by how Fortnite runs on the system. As highlighted in the Digital Foundry analysis, there are some sort of "transition zones" used to load new elements into the game, which show some frametime issues that would be significantly worse if the most demanding UE5 features were in. As such, at the current stage, there's likely no way to scale down these features to a level the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle them, having been developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S specs in mind, especially their CPUs, which are much faster than the Switch 2's. Like in the other consoles' case, it will take some dedicated work and some updates to create a good profile to run games with Lumen and Nanite on Nintendo Switch 2 at acceptable performance.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although it was suggested before release that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">Nintendo Switch 2 CPU shouldn't have been a problem for games</a>, it looks like it is the most challenging aspect of the system, and not only in Unreal Engine 5 games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">The state of the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Gamescom demo</a> also suggested how the system's CPU is impacting performance significantly, requiring more optimization work to make games run at acceptable, playable framerates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox is probably happy overall about the Borderlands 4 launch, which quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke series records</a> for concurrent players active on the Steam platform and did it again this weekend, topping 304K players sixteen hours ago. However, it also has to deal with performance complaints for the PC version, which have been voiced loudly in over 16 thousand and a half Steam reviews, which are currently 'Mixed' (67% rating).</p>



<p>Gearbox Software co-founder and president Randy Pitchford tried to address the performance <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lengthy X thread</a>, alleging that there are some '4K stubborn' PC players who either don't have the hardware to run the game at Ultra HD resolution and should switch to 1440P, or perhaps do not want to use upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS even if they have access to them.</p>



<p><em>I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4K with ultra max settings and using 2-3 year old hardware. You do you, but Borderlands 4 and UE5 are doing a lot, and for me, that trade-off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade-off - the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you’re not 4K stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4K. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.</em></p>



<p><em>If you have a DLSS option, use it! Especially if you’re trying to run at resolutions higher than 1080p. This is a campaign game - you’re not competing in high-stakes esports here. The input latency is so insanely negligible that less than .01% of the population could reliably detect it without tools in a blind test. Take the W on frame rate and use this incredible tech with DLSS on.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, many comments that can be read not only on Steam but also on Reddit, X, and other social channels are from users who insist on using native rendering only. As seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's benchmarks</a>, even the most powerful graphics card available on the market, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090, stops at around 48 frames per second with maxed settings and 4K native resolution. But games are not designed anymore to be running at native resolution, and to be honest, they haven't been for a long time on either PC or consoles. Besides, with the latest NVIDIA DLSS transformer model and AMD FSR 4 (which can be enabled at a driver level by 9000 series users), the visual quality is excellent and the performance gains are massive.</p>



<p>The Gearbox executive eventually <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> one such comment that invited the studio to make their game 'look good without AI upscale'. As usual, Pitchford did not mince words:</p>



<p><em>Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please. We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know.</em></p>



<p>While there is an argument to be made that Borderlands 4 perhaps doesn't look as good as it should for how taxing it is on hardware, and Gearbox absolutely has work to do to improve performance through patches, deliberately choosing to keep AI upscaling disabled when both current hardware and software are designed with that in mind feels like living in the past.</p>



<p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> there is no spyware in the game. The first PC mods have already been uploaded to Nexus, and we've listed a few useful ones <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>
