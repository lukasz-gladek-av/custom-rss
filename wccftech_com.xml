			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several months of rumors</a> about a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, the game that started one of Xbox's most successful franchises, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Interactive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Halo: Campaign Evolved during this year's Halo World Championship event. The remake, powered by Unreal Engine 5 visuals (with the original game's code running beneath), will be released next year on PC, Xbox Series S and X, and even PlayStation 5 for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>As with all remakes, some fans immediately started dissecting the gameplay footage to see what was changed from the original. Even more interesting, though, is the point of view of one of the original developers, Jaime Griesemer, who was a designer on the first three Halo games. <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on X</a>, he criticized some level design changes from Halo: Combat Evolved and eventually likened the remake to the dance remix of a classic song that goes straight to the chorus.</p>



<p><em>You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way, it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.</em></p>



<p><em>Yes, everybody, I know you can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult, but not impossible. You’re welcome!</em></p>



<p><em>On further analysis, I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage, and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore. It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.</em></p>



<p>His perspective isn't shared by one of the co-creators of the Halo franchise, Marcus Lehto (who was recently in the news because he criticized Electronic Arts for not crediting all of his team at Ridgeline Games in Battlefield 6). Lehto was at the Halo World Championship and, <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, relayed a very positive first impression:</p>



<p><em>My honest impression of seeing the new Halo: Campaign Evolved is this:</em></p>



<p><em>I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo: Combat Evolved like this.</em></p>

			<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the first entry in the Halo series announced last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">after months of rumors and speculation</a>, is set to introduce significant visual improvements over both the original and the Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster, judging from some early comparison videos shared online.</p>



<p>Following the game's announcement at this year's Halo WCC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> shared two comparison videos on YouTube, comparing the current available footage of the remake with a recreation of similar sequences in the original and the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster. Needless to say, the differences are massive between the modern remake and the other two versions of the game, offering an unprecedented level of fidelity that will make the iconic first entry in the series shine.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it's clear how, in terms of ambiance and atmosphere, Halo: Campaign Evolved won't try to mimic the original and will instead offer a different take. In this case, which will be better will be up to player's preference.</p>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">feature more than the updated visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5 </a>showcased in the comparison videos above. The remake of the first entry in the Halo series will also come with three new bonus missions set before the events of the campaign, four-player co-op, some gameplay tweaks, including the introduction of sprinting, and more. As the name implies, however, the multiplayer mode of the original Halo won't be remade.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will also mark the series' debut on PlayStation consoles, further compounding Xbox's current multiplatform strategy, which saw the launch of former exclusives on other platforms. The remake will also launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

			<p>Stray, the cat adventure game developed by BlueTwelve and published by Annapurna Interactive, will reportedly headline the PlayStation Plus Essential games lineup for November 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier today, known leaker billbil-kun, who <span>has proven extremely reliable regarding PlayStation Plus game lineup leaks in the past, revealed in a new report posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" target="_blank">Dealabs</a>&nbsp;that the game that made headlines when it was launched in July 2022 for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8mOAV0KJLE">widely appreciated by cats as much as by their owners </a>will be available to all PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers</span> starting from November 4.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Stray's joining the PlayStation Plus library next month would be its return to the service rather than its debut. At launch, the game was made available as part of the PlayStation Plus Extra library and was available to subscribers for around one year. The game's departure from the PlayStation subscription service <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/stray-xbox-release-date/">coincided with the end of its one-year console exclusivity.</a></p>



<p>Although Stray's addition to the PlayStation Plus subscription service may be disappointing for some users, especially after<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/"> this month's addition of the excellent Alan Wake 2</a>, there could still be some surprises waiting in the wings. Two more titles will be part of November's lineup, which is expected to be revealed in full later this week, on October 29.</p>



<p>For those who never had the chance to try out the game before, however, Stray will be an excellent addition to the PlayStation Plus library, as the game features some great visuals, a richly-realized world, fun platforming, and more. You can learn more about it by checking out <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-genre-curious-cat/">Nathan Birch's review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>
