			<p>It seems the news around <strong>Ubisoft</strong> is not stopping anytime soon, as a statement sent to Wccftech (first spotted on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reveals that the company has kicked off a <strong>"<em>voluntary</em>" layoff program</strong> at its <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> headquarters, where it intends to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong> from the studio.</p>



<p>This follows after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">announced it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last week</a>, which saw the entire company get restructured into five different 'Creative Houses,' multiple projects getting delayed or outright cancelled, and caused the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">company's share price to drop to its lowest point since <strong>2011</strong></a>. Now, after a report directly regarding how <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">morale within Ubisoft and specifically at Ubisoft Paris is led by <strong>"<em>anger and despair,"</em></strong></a> we've learned that things are getting worse for employees at the Paris HQ.</p>



<p>It should be noted that, due to this being a voluntary program that will cut as many as 200 employees, it's possible that fewer than 200 positions will be made redundant by the program's completion. The statement confirms that this program <strong>only applies</strong> to employees under Ubisoft International with French contracts, and that no cuts will be made final until an agreement is reached with union representatives and validated by French authorities.</p>



<p>"<em>In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction&nbsp;initiatives, Ubisoft International (HQ' legal entity) has initiated discussions&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;a potential Rupture&nbsp;Conventionnelle&nbsp;Collective (RCC), <strong>a collective, voluntary mutual&nbsp;termination&nbsp;agreement</strong> that could involve&nbsp;around&nbsp;200 positions at its headquarters in France</em>," the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>At this stage, this&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a proposal&nbsp;and will require&nbsp;a collective agreement with&nbsp;unions&nbsp;and validation&nbsp;by French authorities&nbsp;to come into effect.</em> <em>The&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>These cuts are part of the layoffs we were told to expect after Ubisoft made it clear that part of its restructure under this "<em>major reset</em>" would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">further cost reduction to the tune of <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong></a> and a return-to-office mandate, two elements that led to a strike taking place outside of Ubisoft Paris this past Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>It's clear this is not the end of Ubisoft's woes, but only the beginning of a new chapter of bad news for Ubisoft. Last week, ahead of the strike, French video game union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several Ubisoft Paris employees, specifically called out Ubisoft chief executive officer,<strong> Yves Guillemot</strong>, for the company's current issues.</p>



<p>"<em>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games</em>."</p>



<p>As one of the co-founders, along with his brothers, Yves Guillemot and his family have led Ubisoft since its inception. In the last eight years, with Yves at the helm, Ubisoft lost <strong>95% of its total value</strong>, going from a valuation of <strong>$10 billion</strong> to just <strong>$500 million</strong> as of last week.</p>

			<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is one of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">most anticipated games</a></strong> launching on consoles this year. Following <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">two delays</a></strong>, the excitement surrounding the game has only increased, and many are getting ready to jump into this new rendition of<strong> Vice City</strong> with a physical copy of the game to complete their series collection.</p>



<p><span>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>it seems like this won't be possible</strong>, at least not at laun</span>ch, in a move that is just as <strong>unprecedented</strong> as the game is set to be when it is released later this year.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">Polish publication PPE</a></strong>, which has proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/"><strong>quite reliable over the past few months</strong></a>, revealed that the highly anticipated game will <strong>only be available digitally at launch.</strong></p>



<p><em>"This source, who handles physical video game sales in Europe, informed us that Grand Theft Auto 6 publisher Take-Two is currently not planning a physical edition of Lucia and Jason's story. At least not for release due to possible story or gameplay leaks,"</em> the report reads via an automated translation. The physical release will only arrive a few months later, but the source doesn't know if this will happen only a few weeks after launch or only in the first half of 2027.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"We're hearing more and more that the physical version won't be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks. We're getting conflicting reports: some say the physical version will arrive three to four weeks after the digital release, while others say it won't happen until early 2027,"</em> another source said. Thankfully, more information will reportedly be available in mid-February.</p>



<p>Needless to say, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>launching in digital format only is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">incredibly disappointing</strong>. However, considering how many highly anticipated games get into the hands of gamers <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ahead of the official release date</strong>, it's not surprising that Take-Two is willing to go so far to protect what is set to be t<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">he <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a></strong>, and possibly earn more by exclusively selling the game digitally at launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this decision, if final, will not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prevent the release of any Collector's Edition</strong> at launch, which could still include a voucher for the digital version of the game alongside whatever extra goodie is packed in. The value of such a proposition, however, would certainly be diminished by the <strong>lack of a physical copy of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Would a digital-only launch of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> make you wait for the physical release, or would you still get the game when it launches on November 19? Let us know in the comments!</p>
