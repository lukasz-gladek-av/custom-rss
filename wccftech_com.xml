			<p>Michael '<a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/pachter-nintendos-a-bad-company-with-iwata-a-poor-ceo/">Nintendo is a bad company</a>' Pachter, also known as Michael '<a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/03/10/michael-pachter-on-ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/">PlayStation is doomed</a>' Pachter, and sometimes known as Michael Pachter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-24/this-netflix-analyst-has-cost-investors-a-2-000-return">the analyst who cost investors a 2,000% return when he advised them to sell their Netflix stock</a>, is back to an old stomping ground with a new claim that "<em>Sony is blowing it in the games business,</em>" because he predicts that games will move to cloud-based experiences connected to your TVs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CktSxc9_4uk&amp;t=706s">Yahoo Finance</a> discussion (spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/michael-pachter-sony-is-a-terrible-company-they-are-blowing-it-in-the-games-business-games-are-moving-to-connected-tv-via-the-cloud.1312330/">ResetEra</a>) about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">EA going private through its $55 billion sale</a> and where people should place their stock market bets in the videogame industry, when asked if people should be buying Sony stock, Pachter immediately responded, "<em>No, Sony for sure not, Sony is a terrible company, and they actually are blowing it in the games business.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Look, games are moving to connected TV,</em>" he continues. "<em>So, think about all the participants that are going to deliver games the way we get movies via Netflix, and forget the subscription model. Just think about iOS becoming on your TV. So free-to-play games on your TV, who's going to deliver that? Cloud providers, AI, anybody whose investing in making that happen is where you want to be.</em>"</p>



<p>Pachter continued to comment that if people looking to invest in the videogame industry want to invest in any current publishers, they should look towards <a href="https://www.playtika.com/">PlayTika, a mobile game company</a> that Pachter owns 500,000 shares of. Pachter added that it is currently trading at "<em>about a four and a half multiple</em>" and that if it were to get an EA-level multiple, he would make "<em>several million dollars</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time Pachter has bet on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-losing-to-sony-is-a-wrong-gamers-perception-says-pachter-they-want-to-win-business-not-console/">cloud and non-console-based experiences</a> in videogames being the future. He also previously claimed that Microsoft adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/">Activision titles to Xbox Game Pass would bring the service 100 million subscribers</a>, and claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/">in the next decade, Game Pass will have 200 million subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, Pachter has made a career out of these kinds of wild claims and <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-pachter">has been wrong more often than he's been right</a>. It's worth wondering when we can start considering Pachter just an old man shouting at clouds. Or, more accurately, about clouds.</p>



<p>Just days ago, Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino called the PS5 Sony's "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ps5-is-the-most-successful-playstation-generation-ever-making-136-billion-in-sales-so-far">most successful generation to date</a></em>," with $136 billion in sales generated.</p>

			<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day-one patch introduces plenty of improvements to the game, including ray tracing and performance improvements.</p>



<p>As confirmed to <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN</a>, the 1.006 patch will be live by the time the game officially launches on October 2, and it is a highly recommended download for those who are going to play the game with a retail copy, as it will introduce some critical improvements. Chief among them will be multiple improvements to environmental rendering performance, fixes for Ray Tracing Mode to ensure lighting consistency and performance, and various performance improvements in missions with high character counts.</p>



<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day one patch doesn't stop at improving just performance and stability. It is also packed with gameplay fixes, animation improvements, significant environment enhancements, and interface fixes. The full details on every improvement and fix can be found in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-details-ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-notes-includes-an-extensive-list-of-improvements"> full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>Although improvements are always welcome, Ghost of Yōtei was not in dire need of them, as the game looked and played great even without the day-one patch, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">highlighted by Alessio in his review</a>. The game's only major issue, which no patch can fix, is its extreme similarity to the first entry in the series, although it is one that is easy to look past, considering its quality.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei launches worldwide on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If its predecessor is anything to go by, the game is also expected to release on PC in the future</p>
