						<h5>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h5><p><span>June 26th, 2025 (Early Access starting June 24th)</span>
					</p></div><div>

							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Kojima Productions</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads. Oh, how I wish that notable quotable from Doc Emmett Brown held true in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Truth be told, in my sixty-some hours of playing, I perhaps spent most of those hours lugging massive quantities of metal and ceramics halfway across Australia, just to build out another mile-long section of tarmac to make my trip on Pickup Off-Roader. Sure, it’s a vehicle that should be used off roads, given the name, but the reward for fabricating a new stretch of highway is a smooth cruise past any pesky BTs or MULEs.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> opens in a way that many Hollywood sequels do, years after the original: the protagonist, having settled down with the comforts of daily life and a family, is pulled out of retirement for one last job. In Sam Porter Bridges’ case, that’s to head south into the Mexican frontier to bring them into the chiral network, a post-internet-connection that permits the transfer of knowledge and resources across vast distances. It’s here that the player is onboarded back into the role of being a porter and bringing goods from one distant point to the next. It isn’t long before Sam’s daily life is upended by a new antagonist, forcing him out of early retirement for good and venturing out into an even further frontier: Australia.</span></p>
<p><span>Kojima Productions has leaned more into science fiction and the implausible with the concept of harnessing the power of The Beach, a metaphysical realm where the dead wait before proceeding into the afterlife. Despite a brief story recap before getting back into Sam’s boots, there’s still much to The Beach and how it connects worlds that would need an hour-long video essay to unpack truly. The narrative to <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> weaves together impossible concepts and strange interpretations on known supernatural forces so effortlessly into the story that it almost feels insane watching actors chat back and forth about bridge babies (BB’s, for short), stillborn mothers, timefall rain, and many other such examples as if these were commonplace in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Some time during my time with Death Stranding 2 for review, after most of my articles from Summer Game Fest 2025 were put to paper and published, the online servers were intentionally shut down ahead of release. For that last week or two, I braved the Australian landscape all on my own with only a few remnants of players I had connected with prior still littering the paths. Each time I’d pass that introductory stretch of highway leading to the Western Environmental Observatory, I’d pass by a generator dedicated by YongYea or some other internet celebrity with early access to Death Stranding 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Over time, I would see all of the likes and Legend of Legends grades dedicated to one of these monuments and make it my personal goal to surpass them. After all, these were my only connections outside of the world that I was helping to rebuild solo on hours 25-50 of what I’ve played thus far. Perhaps if I spent less time hauling cargo to build out a highway all on my own, I would’ve gone on to finish Death Stranding 2 in time to fill out a complete review. As it stands, I’ve only seen enough of the story to reach the cutoff point that Kojima Productions requested to keep any spoilers down to a minimum. Going by a chapter count in the trophy list, I’m roughly halfway through the story (which isn’t saying much, as Death Stranding 2 features a similar chapter progression to the first game, with some chapters being played out in just a couple of story missions).</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Combat remains a sore spot for me in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, much as it did in the first game. While the actual gunplay has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">massively improved</a>, with a much wider selection of less-than-lethal weaponry (and explosive ordinance/live ammunition when needed) at Sam’s disposal, the act of using it still feels cumbersome in the end. When it came time to clear a MULE base out to take back a mine they had hijacked, I felt much better playing it stealthily at long range with a silenced sniper rifle than I did trying to hit boots on the ground and take these enemy rogues out in CQC combat or with rubber pellet shotguns. The big, bombastic set-piece boss fights are also a bit of a chore and drawn out to where I’d much prefer to see the action played out in a well-directed cutscene versus actually taking part in it myself. I know that I’m in the minority here, especially with how well the combat feels, but I much prefer the laidback aspects of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach to some of Hideo Kojima’s contemporaries.</span></p>

<p><span>Trying to sum up what makes Death Stranding 2: On the Beach such an interesting title is a gargantuan undertaking. What starts as a simple porter job, carrying parcels with love by foot from one point to the next slowly evolves into an adventure of building out infrastructure and automated networks, mining out resources in one corner of the map while traveling about to find a new hot spring fount or Australian wildlife to rescue for the local animal conservation in the next. Each time you feel like you’re getting a grasp on the porter loop, Kojima Productions throws in another system to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online. This is one title that I’ve been taking my time with and enjoying at my own pace, even if that experience has been hauntingly lonely the past couple of weeks.</span></p>

						<section>
				<p>As impossible to to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display is problematic in a number of ways, and it's even worse than its predecessor's in certain scenarios, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Around two weeks after the system launched in most of the world, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared a two-hour-long review of the Nintendo Switch 2, going over every aspect of the system in great detail. Being the first Nintendo system to offer features that have become widely adopted in handheld devices since the launch of the original Switch, great attention has been reserved for the system's display, and the verdict is not good, as the display proved to be problematic in a number of ways. As already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">highlighted</a> earlier this month, HDR support is extremely disappointing, as an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range. Motion quality is possibly even more disappointing, as its blurring characteristics easily make the new system's panel worse than the original Switch's display. The difference in quality becomes even more evident when comparing the Nintendo Switch 2's display with the Switch OLED panel.</p>
<p>It's not just HDR and motion quality that disappoint in the Nintendo Switch 2 display, but also VRR support. There's reason to believe, however, that VRR support could be improved in the future, as Digital Foundry highlighted how Welcome Tour reveals support for LFC, low frame-rate compensation, which should improve the experience when hitting framerates outside the 40- 120Hz VRR window.</p>

<p>Though its display disappoints, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a clear upgrade over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-large-scale-development-is-no-longer-sustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help.1225530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-best-ever/">Super Smash Bros. series</a> creator Masahiro Sakurai thinks that generative AI can help in a time when large-scale development has become unsustainable for various reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITmedia</a>, the creator of one of the most beloved Nintendo franchises ever made commented on the current game development landscape, saying that large-scale development is increasing in size, and is now time-consuming and unsustainable, so much so that Sakurai-san feels that things cannot continue the way they are. Game development has to change, and one of the solutions to this issue is using generative AI, which can be used to improve efficiency. Ultimately, according to Sakurai-san, we have reached an era where only companies that can adapt to this sustainability problem can survive.</p>
<p>While Masahiro Sakurai's statement could be interpreted as a full-on endorsement of the use of generative AI in game development, ResetERA forums member sprsk <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/#post-141809601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a bit of context related to the Japanese game development landscape. According to the user, the talent pool in Japan is getting smaller and smaller, and so there are not enough developers to sustain large-scale development, thus, using generative AI could help in a scenario where there are not enough developers. The user added that hiring from overseas could be a solution, but the language barrier will always be a problem, making it difficult to fill the gaps in talent in Japan this way.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a high-profile Nintendo developer, such as the Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, has commented on generative AI use in game development. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto weighed in on the matter, highlighting how Nintendo tends to go the opposite direction the industry as a whole goes, directly referencing the AI craze that is increasingly threatening jobs in game development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/3dsen-nes-emulator-brings-new-life-to-final-fantasy-dragon-quest/">3dSen NES emulator</a> has finally left early access after having been in development for 10 years, and its 1.0 release is now available for purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>The emulator is a passion project that reimagines classic NES games by turning them from 2D to playable 3D voxel dioramas. The improvements introduced to the supported games don't stop here, as the emulator introduced real-time lighting and shadows and animated skyboxes that breathe new life into some all-time classics. Unfortunately, the emulator doesn't yet support every NES game, but among the 100+ currently supported games are the Super Mario Bros. games, Contra, Metroid, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Duck Hunt, Mega Man, Castlevania, and others. The list of supported titles is constantly expanding thanks to the work of the <a href="https://itch.io/board/872690/profile-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community,</a> which is creating custom profiles using 3dSenMaker.</p>
<p>In case you have never seen the 3dSen emulator in action, you can check out the trailer below shared to celebrate its 1.0 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="3dSen Version 1.0 - Official Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_y2AE-kWtjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To further celebrate this important milestone, the 3dSen emulator is now available on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147940/3dSen_PC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Steam</a> with a 40% discount that will be available until June 26th, so make sure to take advantage of the offer if you're interested in what this impressive emulator has to offer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xenia Canary Development Team Is Not Working With Microsoft on the Xbox Classics Program]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xenia-canary-team-not-working-xbox-classics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenia-canary-development-team-is-not-working-with-microsoft-on-the-xbox-classics-program.1225476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenia Canary development team is not working with Microsoft on the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/">Xbox Classics program</a>, the team itself confirmed in a new statement shared online.</p>
<p>As reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lhsg0m/xenia_team_post_official_response_about_rumoured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the development team of the Xbox 360 emulator confirmed on their official Discord server that they are not associated with Microsoft by any means, nor are they working with the company in any capacity. Microsoft uses its own emulation to deliver backward compatibility on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, the team added, and, as such, has no reason to collaborate with Xenia if they ever decide to bring their games to PC.</p>
<p>Though one may argue the Xenia Canary team could never confirm they are working on the Xbox Classics program under an NDA, if the team actually signed such an agreement, they would keep their silence on the matter, so at this point, there's no reason not to believe the developer's official statement. This doesn't mean that Microsoft isn't working on bringing classic Xbox games to PC and current consoles, but it also makes the rumor less credible, although the original leaker has doubled down on the matter, saying that such a program is indeed in the works and will be revealed next year to coincide with Xbox's 25th anniversary.</p>
