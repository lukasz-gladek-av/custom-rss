			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.5 tech demo inspired by Blade Runner and other Cyberpunk works is now available for download, allowing users with the proper hardware to experience how much Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections, alongside other ray tracing features, can enhance visuals.</p>
<p>The tech demo, which can be downloaded here, was created by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dyr4K3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pasquale Scionti</a>, who originally aimed to create a Cyberpunk scene using only dynamic lighting and, as such, used no Lumen, no path tracing, and no ray tracing in the original UE 5.3 version of the demo. The developer has now released a new version of the demo created powered by Unreal Engine 5.5.4 featuring Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections as well as Hardware Ray Tracing for Ambient Occlusion, Reflections, and Shadows, which looks downright stunning. All of this, however, comes at a cost in terms of performance, as even a powerful GPU like the RTX 4090 can run the demo at 60 FPS only at 1440p resolution, proving once again how hardware is still not ready for demanding advanced lighting tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Standalone Cyber Streets Tech Demo Engine 5.5.4 Lumen / RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlx3VsWqjkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.5, which is the latest major version of the game development engine by Epic, has been used by multiple developers to power up some interesting projects, which include unofficial remasters of<a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-stunning-unreal-engine-5-5-zora-river-demo-is-now-available-for-download/"> Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim</a>, although performance leaves something to be desired in most cases, even on powerful hardware. According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, when Unreal Engine 5 launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-gpus-two-generations-behind-rtx-6000-well/">GPUs were two generations behind</a>, and it will only be with the RTX 6000 series that games powered by the engine will run well, so it will be a while longer until framerates won't have to be sacrificed in the name of better visuals.</p>

			<p>An upcoming Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition mod will introduce significant ray tracing improvements to the game.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/badassbaboon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a>, BadassBaboon, a known GTA V modder, confirmed that an exclusive Enhanced Edition feature is currently in the works for the V: Definitive Edition mod that will improve ray-traced reflections. Reportedly, assets were not updated in the latest version of the popular open-world game to take advantage of the new ray-traced reflections, and, as such, the mod will improve puddles, reflective surfaces, glasses, and windows across the map. The modder also shared some work-in-progress screenshots, which can be found below.</p>

<p>Though Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition isn't perfect, it is a stunning upgrade to the open-world game by Rockstar and, most likely, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">a preview of the ray tracing features</a> we will see in Grand Theft Auto VI later this year. The CPU load of ray-traced global illumination, however, is yet another strong indication that we will have to wait until the PC release to experience the new entry in the series in all of its glory at high framerates, as it's very unlikely consoles will be able to push beyond 30 FPS with RTGI.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC, complete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features not available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</a> You can learn more about the new upgrade by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece.</a></p>

			<p>Multiple Nintendo Switch game prototypes have leaked online, including prototypes of an unreleased Ridge Racer game and a canceled RPG that was in the works by Metroid Prime series' developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>According to multiple online<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jtcjcr/several_switch_dev_builds_has_leaked_from_devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a>, the prototypes leaked online after they were found in a devkit, and include old Splatoon 2 debug builds, the Nintendo Switch version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a>, an unreleased Lego Civilization game, an ARMS debug build and prototypes of a new entry in the Ridge Racer series and of Retro Studios' canceled Project Harmony music RPG which was reportedly in development after the studio released Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Metroid Prime Remastered. Footage of the latter two games was also shared online and can be found <a href="https://streamable.com/2mkoof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Project Harmony and below for the Ridge Racer prototype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An early build of the cancelled Ridge Racer game developed by Bandai Namco Studios Singapore has been leaked online, built on Unreal Engine 4! This dates back to January 6th, 2017.<br>
Here's footage of the game build in action!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RidgeRacer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RidgeRacer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BandaiNamco?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BandaiNamco</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UE4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UE4</a> <a href="https://t.co/YhqS3a1vWu">pic.twitter.com/YhqS3a1vWu</a></p>
<p>— Jesse Young (@resethepicture) <a href="https://twitter.com/resethepicture/status/1909086888616747239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given Bandai Namco's strong relationship with Nintendo, it is not surprising to see that the collaboration between the two companies was leading to the return of the Ridge Racer series on Nintendo Switch. While the game has been canceled, the collaboration between the two companies still continues to this day, as Bandai Namco is working with Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai on Kirby Air Riders, which is launching this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. A collaboration that is hardly surprising, considering Sakurai-san teamed up with Bandai Namco for the development of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U &amp; 3DS and Ultimate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Minecraft Movie has shattered expectations at the box office, proving the strength of the IP created by Mojang and owned by Microsoft. Whereas estimates assumed it could earn around $150 million globally, the videogame adaptation actually opened up to $157 million earned in the United States and $144 in the rest of the world, for a grand total of $301 million throughout the whole weekend.</p>
<p>This set a new record, improving upon Nintendo's and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $146.4 million across the United States in its first three days in theaters. Of course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie continued its run to earn <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $500 million in its first week</a> and $1.36 billion at the end of its box office run. We'll have to wait and see if A Minecraft Movie has the same legs, but so far, the indications are very positive.</p>
<p>The movie was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and the company's chiefs, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, wasted no time expressing their elation at the news:</p>
<p><em>We’re absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world. A Minecraft Movie’s decade-long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP’s Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.</em></p>
<p>The film was directed by Jared Hess and features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel House, and Jemaine Clement. Jack Black plays Steve, who is the default player character skin in the game.</p>
<p>The success of A Minecraft Movie will likely spur even more videogame adaptations across film and TV. That said, it's worth remembering that Minecraft is the best-selling game ever, with over 350 million copies sold to date. As such, this adaptation's successful release is not necessarily indicative of other intellectual properties.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Japanese Gaming Companies’ Shares Tank Due to US Tariffs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/japanese-gaming-companies-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-gaming-companies%E2%80%99-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs.1156893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/japanese-gaming-companies-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The burden of the US tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump is taking a heavy toll on the shares of Japanese gaming companies today. Sony was hit the hardest, losing just over 10% of its market value in a single session. Nintendo isn't far off, losing 7.85% today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Big N is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. Pre-orders were supposed to go live on Wednesday, April 9; however, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> in the United States precisely because of the aforementioned tariffs, and now users fear the console and its accessories might get even pricier. Needless to say, investors aren't keen on the impact this might have on the console's success, either.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo, known for Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, and Atelier among others, is losing 7.63%. Bandai Namco, publisher of franchises like Ace Combat, Dark Souls, Dragon Ball, and Tekken just to name a few, is losing 7.37%. SEGA Sammy, the legendary publisher of franchises like Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, Like a Dragon, Sonic, and Total War, is close by with -7.29%. CAPCOM, another revered Japanese gaming company (Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, etc.), loses 6.61%. Square Enix (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean) loses 5.62%. Lastly, KONAMI is currently down 'only' 5.19%. The latter company has relied less on videogaming for some time, although that is changing rapidly with the revival of beloved franchises such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the tariffs will probably hit Western game companies just as hard as they are doing with Japanese ones. However, due to the timezone, this is the first glimpse we have at how the industry (which is already ailing due to increased budgets and stifled growth) is reacting to the application of the US tariffs. It's not looking good, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>
