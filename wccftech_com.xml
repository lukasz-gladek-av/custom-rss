						<h5>AceZone A-Spire Wireless</h5><p><span>May 3rd, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone may not be among the most popular gaming headset brands, but it has been making a name for itself for some time by producing headsets for eSports tournaments, focusing on features tailored for this specific use case. In the past few years, however, the company entered the domestic headset market with some headsets, including the A-Spire and the A-Rise headsets, which brought some of these features, such as excellent noise canceling with Active Noise Control built for gaming, fast in-game response and more. The A-Spire model was later updated with some additional features, becoming the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which is among the best headsets for eSports aficionados who want to step up their performance while also providing enough to to be enticing for those looking for a versatile headset that delivers great audio quality for single-player games and music playback.</p>
<p>At a glance, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which comes with a hard carry case, looks almost like a non-gaming headset, featuring a rather simple color scheme, black with some metallic grey highlights, with no other standout element. On the back of the left earpad are the power button and the Active Noise Cancelation button, while on the right are the volume control and pause/play buttons. On the side of the left earpad is also the microphone, which, sadly, cannot be removed from the headset (but this was to be expected for a headset tailored for eSports and competitive play). Disabling the microphone, however, is extremely simple, as it only has to be brought to a vertical position where it can easily held in place and secured.</p>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless design may be unremarkable, the headset shows its qualities right from the very first use. The excellent build quality, and its light weight, which makes the headset very comfortable to use even after 3+ hours in conjunction with the high-quality earpad foam, are only the beginning. Noise cancelling, as mentioned above, has always been one of the main focuses of AceZone for its headsets, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless definitely delivers on this front. The Advanced Hybrid ANC built for gaming does an excellent job providing complete immersion, and during the vast majority of my gaming sessions with the headsets, I wasn't able to hear anything outside of the game's audio, as every loud noise was effectively canceled. To test how far the headset's noise canceling could go, I tested it out in a definitely not intended use case while playing acoustic drums, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless still did an excellent job, as I could clearly hear the click and backing tracks clearly while playing some heavy music.</p>
<p>Pressing the dedicated ANC button on the left earpad also enables Transparency Mode, which amplifies ambient sound, allowing it to pass through the headset and let the user hear the outside world clearly without removing the headset.&nbsp; The AceZone A-Spire Wireless microphone noise canceling is possibly even more impressive, as the microphone works great and effectively only picks up the user's voice while filtering out even some pretty loud noises, although it has to be positioned slightly closer to the mouth than the vast majority of other headsets on the market to work properly, which may take some time to get used to.</p>
<p>The biggest update the AceZone A-Spire Wireless offers over the base model, not is its proper wireless capabilities. Included in the box is a USB dongle that is effectively plug-and-play, as the user does not have to do anything other than keep a button pressed on the dongle to pair the headset with it. Latency with the dongle is pretty much non-existent, although the 2.4 GHz connection could suffer from interference, which I didn't experience as all the devices I use with my PC are wired. The AceZone A-Spire Wireless can also be connected via a regular headphone jack, such as the one included with the headset, and via a regular Bluetooth connection, which works well, but not as well as with the dongle. Pairing and using the headset with a PlayStation 5 and an Android mobile phone was just as painless, and the Bluetooth connection worked great in both instances with no latency, although your experience may vary depending on interference from other devices.</p>
<p>All this wouldn't matter much if the AceZone A-Spire Wireless delivered poor audio quality, but that is most definitely not the case here. The contrary, actually, as the headset delivers great audio quality in the vast majority of scenarios, and some of the best audio quality in eSports games, where the headset, unsurprisingly, truly shines. The game's sound design really has to accommodate its unique features. In a game like Counter-Strike 2, for example, it is possible to clearly hear sounds like footsteps from further away than with other headsets and place them very accurately. In other competitive-focused games, however, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless may not help players level up their game a lot, as loud music or sound unrelated to the gameplay end up drowning sounds that could help the player understand where the opponents are and so on.</p>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless has been designed mostly for eSports, I have found the headset to be quite versatile, making it a worthwhile purchase even for those who aren't into competitive play. In games I have played for hundreds of hours and know extremely well, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Tales of Graces f, I was able to hear sounds I never noticed, such as environmental sounds that usually get lost in lower-quality headsets and audio systems, which, in conjunction with the excellent noise canceling, increased immersion considerably. In a game designed to be as immersive as possible, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the headset fared even better, allowing me to listen to all sorts of environmental sounds so clearly that I really felt like I was Henry from Skalitz, traveling in medieval Bohemia. Something similar happened when listening to music, as, for example, I was able to hear clearly drummers keeping time with the hi-hat pedal, which is usually a very soft sound that doesn't emerge in most mixes, especially in heavy music like Progressive and Extreme Metal.</p>
<p>The AceZone A-Spire Wireless tries to do something different even in regards to changing settings. All of the company's headsets are compatible with a free smart device app that allows the user to set up different equalization presets for both the headphones and the microphone, tweak Transparency, enable Outside Mode, which lowers wind noise when the headset is used outdoors, and Glasses Mode, which optimizes ANC damping performance when wearing them. The best thing about the app is that it saves settings straight into the headset so that even console players can tweak them with ease.</p>
<p>All the advanced features of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless are extremely good to have, but the real question for most will be if the headset is worth its somewhat high price. That strictly depends on the user. For eSport titles with the proper sound design, the headset truly shines, giving players the same tools the best players in the world use in tournaments, giving them the chance to improve their performance. For regular use with single-player gaming and for music playback, on the other hand, the value of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless' unique features is somewhat diminished, and a more affordable headset may be more enticing. Still, if one is not afraid to spend a little more than usual, they will find a great headset that may give them a greater appreciation of the sound design of their favorite games, regardless of the genre.</p>

			<p>The highly anticipated total conversion mod <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a> was once again showcased by the talented modders during a 40-minute live gameplay demo. During the stream, the creators also answered several questions from the fans.</p>
<p>In this recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion into Skyrim's engine, long-time players of the classic 2006 open world RPG will find some differences in character progression:</p>
<p><em>We've got the Oblivion attributes returning. We've adjusted the way they progress slightly. Rather than giving you points based on how you level up each skill per level, you just get a fixed number of points per level, similar to Fallout really. That helps alleviate a lot of the issues that Oblivion had with character progression, where if you didn't optimize your level up, you ended up with a character that was too weak for scaled enemies.</em></p>
<p><em>For the most part, our level up system is comparable to Skyrim in the way that the enemies scale with you. We've got someone going through now creating different tiers of enemies, so you won't just be going straight from imps straight to ogres. There will actually be different levels of power for each species, so that helps kind of balance things out a bit.</em></p>
<p>The new Skyblivion UI (user interface) allows players to easily keep track of all their stats and also all the factions they're a part of. Answering a question from a viewer, the team said there wouldn't be a Radiant Quest system like Skyrim's at launch. However, the content is set up in a way that creating a mod like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missives</a> should make it entirely possible to add the feature.</p>
<p>When asked whether Skyblivion would use sound effects from Oblivion, Skyrim, or original ones, they answered:</p>
<p><em>We'll be using a mix of all three. We'll create new sound effects; we've got a really great sound designer on the project. Also, where we can, we use Oblivion sounds because we can extract them from your Oblivion installation. There are certain effects, like skeletons, which come from Skyrim. And then there's small stuff like footsteps, which have been replaced and are a bit more specific for the type of ground you're walking on, and there's small little touches like that.</em></p>
<p><em>We should actually mention that the sound designer we have is the developer of the really popular Skyrim <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio Overhaul mod</a>, so a lot of people who have played modern Skyrim are probably quite familiar with the quality of work he does.</em></p>

<p>The Skyblivion team has been working on this project for a long time. We first covered it <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late 2016</a>, with the modders having started earlier that year. Nine years later, they are just about ready to launch, having reconfirmed in this latest video that the goal is to release it in 2025.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, though, insistent rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that Bethesda might be about to launch its own official remaster of Oblivion.</p>
