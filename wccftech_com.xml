			<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul, a new fighting game developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind the Guilty Gear series and Dragon Ball FighterZ, has been announced today for a release next year.</p>
<p>The game, which was revealed with a new trailer shown during today's State of Play presentation, will be the first tag fighting game to feature 4v4 fights, which promise to be intense and explosive, judging from the trailer.</p>

<p>Following the State of Play presentation, a blog post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">Official PlayStation Blog</a> provided some additional information on the game. Learning multiple characters in a fighting game can be a daunting task, but Arc System Works aimed from the very beginning to make a game that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. <em>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game,"</em> said Game Director and Lead Battle Designer, Kazuto Sekine. <em>"We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together – creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."</em></p>
<p>More information has also been provided on the Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul character roster and how each character was picked. According to Producer Takeshi Yamanaka, the team picked characters that could be considered as the face of Marvel and characters that could deliver a balanced variety of fighting styles. Despite featuring many popular characters, the game will also feature some characters who have never been playable in a fighting game before.</p>
<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul will launch on PC in 2026 via Steam and the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>Konami has announced that<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gets-new-trailer-details-and-pc-requirements/"> Silent Hill f</a> will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 25, 2025, with a new trailer showcasing a good chunk of gameplay during the PlayStation State of Play event for June 2025.</p>
<p>The new trailer showed more of the chilling atmosphere that Konami is creating in Silent Hill f, and some more combat, exploration, and, of course, a few of the terrifying creatures you'll have to face over the course of the story.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL f | Release Date Trailer (4K: EN/ESRB) | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lpf9LoIWylA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> also dug more into the story and the gameplay, and the different editions that'll be available when it launches in September, which is just a standard and a deluxe edition for now. The deluxe edition will include a digital artbook, soundtrack, and an additional cosmetic for Shimizu Hinako, the story's protagonist.</p>
<p>Notably, the blog&nbsp; post did point out that players on PS5 Pro will be able to take advantage of the Enhanced graphics mode that's only available on the Pro. It doesn't specify what the Enhanced mode will look like, just that Pro players will see that Silent Hill f "<em>retains graphical fidelity at a stable FPS</em>" when playing on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>When Silent Hill f was revealed, we were all still waiting for Silent Hill 2 Remake from Bloober Team. Now that the remake has come and gone, and Bloober Team largely knocked it out of the park, players are ready for more Silent Hill. Right now, Silent Hill f looks like it'll ramp up the momentum the remake kicked up. Hopefully, it delivers.</p>
