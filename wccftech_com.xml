			<p>A Steam Deck 2 powered by the newly announced AMD Ryzen Z2 is not in the works, a Valve employee confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the rumors that started circulating online after the announcement of the next-gen AMD APUs for future iterations of portable gaming systems which suggested that a Steam Deck 2 was in the works, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on Bluesky that there is and there won't be a Z2 Steam Deck, specifying how the slide that accompanied the APUs' announcement was just meant to highlight how they were meant for portable gaming systems, and they were not announcing anything specific.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fujt6oiklsacwfkoqyzwiu2z/app.bsky.feed.post/3lf36y66ggs2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigjmkrybod6dx43kordi2sff6iwzfq4xhquu67fo2chk5i3vs7cdy">
<p lang="en">There is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>

<p>While we won't see a Steam Deck 2 powered by any of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APUs</a> announced during CES 2025, it won't take long to see what the next-generation chips can bring to the portable gaming space. The first APUs will make their debut in the first quarter of the year, which will also likely be when the first portable systems powered by them will appear on the market.</p>
<p>With no Steam Deck 2 on the horizon, the OLED model featuring a much better screen and some light improvements over the base model will continue to be the go-to system for those wishing to enter the portable gaming space with Valve hardware. More information on the original system released back in 2022 can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5.1075797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A number of big NVIDIA ACE announcements were shared during the company's CES 2025 keynote. NVIDIA has expanded its ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine) technology, originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Computex 2023, in various ways. The improved tech will provide AI-powered allies and foes in multiple big PC games.</p>
<p>KRAFTON, for example, has gone all-in on NVIDIA ACE. Its leading product, PUBG, will add 'co-playable characters' through the so-called PUBG Ally feature. Powered by the Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-instruct small language model (SMM), PUBG Ally lets AI teammates communicate using game-specific lingo, provide strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and even fight other players.</p>
<p>KRAFTON CEO CH Kim said:</p>
<p><em>CES 2025 marks a significant milestone for KRAFTON and NVIDIA as we work together to unveil AI technology that will revolutionize the gaming industry. We plan to closely collaborate with NVIDIA to drive the transformation of the user experience with AI-powered innovation, such as CPC, that promises to redefine the future of gaming.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEKUSMqrbzQ?si=qI8HIZZ8b5iO51mj" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inZoi</a>, KRAFTON's upcoming life simulation game, is also using NVIDIA ACE with a spin of its own on the co-playable characters concept. The so-called 'Smart Zoi' will dynamically adapt to what's happening around them and react based on their personalities. For example, a Smart Zoi with a considerate personality could notice a hungry man on the street, go to the food store and grab him something to eat. In another instance, they might help a lost woman by giving them directions.</p>
<p>Kangwook Lee, Head of Deep Learning Division at KRAFTON, said:</p>
<p><em>PUBG IP Franchise's PUBG Ally and inZOI's Smart Zoi, rising as the world's first CPC (Co-Playable Character) built with NVIDIA ACE, are unlocking new and unique experiences. At KRAFTON, we’re excited by the possibilities of ACE autonomous game characters and how AI will enhance the way we create games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | inZOI - Create Simulated Cities with Co-Playable Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pk9z1upOj3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other developers are also implementing similar NVIDIA ACE powered features in their games. For example, NetEase has announced that AI teammates will be added to its highly successful free-to-play Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint. These NPCs will join the player's party, battle alongside them, find specific items that they might need, swap gear, offer suggestions on which skills to unlock, and fight smartly to help the player win.</p>
<p>Zhipeng Hu, Head of Thunder Fire BU and SVP of NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA enables game developers to push past expected boundaries with AI technology. NVIDIA ACE in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION allows us to create AI autonomous characters that allows us to create AI autonomous teammates running on the device locally that naturally assist the player in their epic battles.</em></p>
<p>The feature is coming in March to the mobile version of NARAKA: Bladepoint playable on PC, while the native PC version is getting it later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION - Introduces AI Powered Teammates" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I65tiaHQuFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the other hand, Korean developer Wemade is going to use it in its MIR5 MMORPG to power what they're calling the world's first AI boss, Asterion, Lord of the Void. MMORPG players know all too well that even the most complicated bosses are static and, therefore, predictable for humans. The goal here with NVIDIA ACE is to change all that forever.</p>
<p>The AI model enables Asterion to analyze the party, identify each player's unique skills, and determine who to attack first, such as the healer, traditionally the weakest character. Asterion also recalls past battles similar to the current situation and then determines the most probable course of action to achieve victory. The boss will also constantly adapt, attacking with unpredictable patterns so that it cannot be defeated twice with the same strategy.</p>
<p>Jung Soo Park, CEO of Wemade Next, said:</p>
<p><em>Together with NVIDIA, we have begun a new era of gaming with NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters. MIR5’s AI bosses are a milestone moment in gaming, enabling unique boss encounters with every play session. We’re excited to see how this technology transforms games.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | MIR5 - Wemade Introduces the First AI Boss" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8XeiZ4djKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA ACE is being utilized in many different ways by developers. For example, the upcoming murder mystery game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Meat</a> will use it to power its fully dynamic conversations locally. The game previously used LLMs via cloud, but at CES 2025, they showed locally generated dialogue running on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU.</p>
<p>Developer Meaning Machine integrated ACE and NVIDIA's Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-128K small language model (SLM), Eleven Labs' Text To Speech (TTS), and Open AI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) into its own Game Conscious AI system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | Dead Meat - Bringing AI Characters On Device" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFwIVnDU8KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>GoodAI's sandbox game AI People features AI-driven NPCs that interact autonomously with each other, their environment, and the player, creating a dynamic AI-generated narrative. The developer says these NPCs learn, experience emotions, pursue their goals, dream, talk,&nbsp;and create a dynamic story for the player. Built using extensive language and speech recognition models, AI People can now run locally on a GeForce RTX GPU in addition to the previous cloud option.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z98IdBAM4NM?si=uE2ulIT2RcYOyvKR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>TiGames, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f-i-s-t-forged-in-the-shadow-torch-grease-stained-furtasy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch</a>, has showcased a tech demo called ZooPunk where the combination of several AI technologies lets NPCs communicate naturally with the player. A speech model listens to their voice and translates the words to text, while a language model parses the text to understand the intention behind the sentence and generate the NPC's response. The NPC's voice is also AI-powered, and NVIDIA ACE provides lip synchronization with Audio2Face. Perhaps more interestingly, the demo shows the first use of on-device in-game Stable Diffusion image generation, where the player can simply ask the NPC to repaint the airship with new art. The ZooPunk demo also ran on the new GeForce RTX GPUs, not on the cloud.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | ZooPunk - TiGames Partner Spotlight - New Dimensions for In-Game Customizations" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEZAYvHIAgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, NVIDIA ACE's Audio2Face is also featured in the recently launched VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>. Moreover, Perfect World Games is using it for its Unreal Engine 5-powered MMORPG World of Jade Dynasty. Perfect World Games brought a showcase video at CES 2025 to demonstrate how Audio2Face allows them to animate their vast cast of characters in both Chinese and English.</p>
<p>The animations are dynamically adjusted based on various variables detected in the recorded voice acting. Of course, if any adjustments are needed, developers can intervene manually to make changes as they see fit, tailoring dialogue for specific scenes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant.1075794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2, the next evolution of the innovative tech used today in over 100 games to reduce latency, promises to further reduce latency by up to 75%.</p>
<p>As announced during CES 2025, NVIDIA Reflex 2 will combine Reflex Low Latency mode with a new Frame Warp technology that will further reduce latency by updating the rendered game frame based on the latest mouse input before it is sent to the display. This new technology was developed based on a study conducted by NVIDIA's esports research team four years ago which illustrated how players could complete aiming tasks faster when frames are updated after being rendered based on the more recent mouse input. As such, shifting or warping an existing frame to show the result of the action sooner could bring some significant improvements in terms of latency.</p>
<p>This is exactly what NVIDIA Reflex 2's Frame Warp tech does. As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline based on the player's input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU and warps the frame rendered by the GPU to the newer camera position, doing so at the very last moment to ensure the latest input is shown on screen. To prevent the small holes in the image created when the new camera position shows a new part of a scene, NVIDIA developed a latency-optimized predictive rendering algorithm that uses camera, color, and depth data from prior frames to fill these holes accurately, making players see the rendered frame with the updated camera position without any hole and with reduced latency for any action that caused the camera shift. All this will allow players to improve their aim and tracking of enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA Reflex 2 | Introducing New Frame Warp Technology" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpDxo2m6Sko?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Together with the explanation above, NVIDIA also showcased NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology in Embark Studio's The Finals, which will be among the first games to support it. Without Reflex, on an RTX 5070 GPU at 4K, max settings, latency is 56ms, which is reduced to 27ms with Reflex 1 and to 14ms with Reflex 2.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology will also provide significant improvements in CPU-limited scenarios. In VALORANT, which will also support the technology soon, on an RTX 5090 that can run the game at over 800 FPS on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-gpu-custom-models-roundup/">RTX 5090</a>, latency is reduced to an average of under 3ms with Frame Warp, which is extremely impressive.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 will debut together with the GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, with support for other RTX GPUs coming in the future. More information on the newly announced technology can be found on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-2-even-lower-latency-gameplay-with-frame-warp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>

			<p>NVIDIA did not forget about its GeForce NOW cloud platform during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big CES 2025 keynote</a>. First, it was confirmed that two highly anticipated PC games, the action RPG Avowed from Obsidian and the first-person shooter DOOM: The Dark Ages from id Software, will be available to play on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>Avowed is coming in a little over a month. Set for release on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, the game will provide fans of the Eora setting (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity franchise) with a brand new perspective on the vibrant fantasy world.&nbsp;I got to play a few hours of a demo build last month and shared these thoughts in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview article</a>:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't have a launch date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will support path tracing and DLSS 4</a>. While the GeForce NOW servers don't support the newly announced DLSS 4 yet, Ultimate tier users will be able to run DLSS 3 as usual.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced that GeForce NOW is officially coming to a series of new devices, such as Valve's Steam Deck. Truthfully, a beta installation method was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-can-now-be-installed-more-easily-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by NVIDIA last May. However, a native app will be available for download later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GeForce NOW | Full Support for Steam Deck Coming Soon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlK5UWuj9is?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming solution is also expanding to VR and MR devices like the Meta Quest 3 and 3S, Apple's Vision Pro, and Pico headsets. Starting later this month, VR and MR users will be able to use GeForce NOW on these devices by opening the browser <a href="http://play.geforcenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA is adding India to the list of supported GFN countries later in 2025 thanks to the opening of an RTX 4080-powered data center. Thailand should also be added soon via a local partnership with Brothers Pictures.</p>

			<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GeForce RTX Series GPUs</a> at CES 2025, NVIDIA has also unveiled a series of new or updated RTX technologies that will be in upcoming PC games, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>id Software's much anticipated medieval-themed first-person shooter game coming later this year will run on the latest version of the id Tech engine, powered by full path tracing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced DLSS 4</a> with support for Multi Frame Generation. It will also take advantage of the improved Ray Reconstruction for increased lighting stability and detail. You can take a peek at DOOM: The Dark Ages with the full suite of NVIDIA RTX technologies in the DLSS 4 medley video below. Needless to say, it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX.

<p>Billy Khan, Director of Engine Technology at id Software, has shared a comment:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4, we are stepping into a new era of gaming. The new ray reconstruction transformer model powers a historical leap in raytracing capabilities; not just accelerating performance but also enhancing visuals in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</em></p>
<p>The game doesn't have a fixed launch date yet. When it comes out, it will be playable on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 on day one.</p>
<p>Back on DLSS 4 and the newly announced or updated NVIDIA RTX technologies, they will, of course, be available at launch on other upcoming PC titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black State</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a>, all of which will support DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Kadir Demirden, CEO of Black State developer Motion Blur, said:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 are game-changing. We now have the power and technologies to realize the future of interactive storytelling with Black State.</em></p>

<p>But it's not just new games that will be updated. On top of the 75 games with day 0 support, more hit games from 2024 and 2023 will receive improvements, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Alan Wake 2. The former is being updated not only to add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models but also with a new RTX Hair technology. Jim Kjellin, CTO of Indiana Jones developer MachineGames, said:</p>
<p><em>With GeForce RTX 50 Series, players will be able to experience Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at its best. With elevated image quality, performance, and new neural rendering tech like NVIDIA RTX Hair introduces a new level of character realism, truly adding to the immersion of becoming Indy.</em></p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, RTX Hair features a new Linear-Swept Sphere rendering that runs faster, with improved image quality, whilst using less VRAM. You can preview the RTX Hair update in the comparison image below.</p>

<p>As for Alan Wake 2, Remedy's horror game will be updated to include the new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit#ido12x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry technology</a>, which is going to be available on all RTX GPUs and laptops. NVIDIA says it can accelerate BVH building for cluster-based geometry systems, enabling up to 100x more ray-traced triangles and better performance in heavily ray-traced scenes, reducing CPU overhead.</p>
<p>The game will also add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction transformer model. Additionally, NVIDIA unveiled that Remedy will introduce a new Ultra quality Ray Tracing preset featuring fully ray-traced refractions, fully ray-traced transparent reflections, and higher quality fully ray-traced indirect lighting. This will all be part of the next Alan Wake 2 update. Mika Vehkala, Chief Technology Officer at Remedy Entertainment, commented:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4 and GeForce RTX 50 Series we are seeing significant performance gains which enable us to create new game worlds larger and more detailed than ever.</em></p>

<p>Later this year, three more popular PC games will introduce support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, and NARAKA: Bladepoint. There's no ETA on the availability for the first game, while Marvel Rivals and NARAKA: Bladepoint are both getting the update next month.</p>

			<p>Despite being one of the longest-running JRPG series still active today, Falcom's Ys series started seeing some measure of success only recently, but this wasn't caused by an increase in the quality of newer entries in the series over the older ones, as Adol's adventures have always been extremely fun to play through and generally well-received by the dedicated fan base, with only a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is the third entry in the series, Wanderers from Ys, a game that wasn't as well received as the first two entries in the series due to the fact that it did away with the fast-paced top-down experience, replacing it with a side-scrolling experience similar to Zelda II which left something to be desired. As such, no one was surprised to see the original eventually getting completely remade with Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a well-realized remake that surpassed not only the original but almost every other entry in the series. Twenty years after the remake's original release, Western audiences on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch can now enjoy an enhanced version of the game with Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, which stands out as the definitive edition of the classic action role-playing game by Falcom.</p>

<p>The core features that made up the Ys: Oath in Felghana experience haven't changed much in Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, such as the story. Following their adventures in Esteria and Ys, the renowned red-haired adventurer Adol Christin and his new friend Dogi journey to Felghana, a region that has changed a lot since Dogi left his hometown of Redmont eight years prior. Everything that could go wrong is seemingly doing so, as the region is beset by monsters, a once dormant volcano has become active again, and the lord of the land is vexing the population and extorting money from them, with the apparent involvement of Dogi's childhood friend Chester. Not capable of turning the other way, Adol decides to help the people of Felghana and his friend Dogi, eventually discovering that there is much more at work than some tyrannical lord out to take money from the poor people he was supposed to guide and protect.</p>
<p>Those who got into the series only recently with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-viii-lacrimosa-dana-wonderful-adventure/">Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-the-night-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Ys X: Nordics</a> may find this story a little on the straightforward side, lacking a huge cast of well-developed characters or plot twists, but in more than a few ways, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana in 2025 feels quite refreshing, as the game does its absolute best to keep players into the action, keeping the story elements to the minimum. This is not to say that the story is in any way bad. The contrary, actually: the sense of adventure that permeates the series is in full show here, just in a more condensed form that serves the experience in the best of ways.</p>

<p>Much like for the story and characters, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana for the first time after experiencing more recent entries in the series may feel at first like taking a few steps back, as the experience is considerably more straightforward than in pretty much every game that came after the 2005 original. There are no multiple playable characters nor deep character customization here, only Adol, his sword, and the three special elemental attacks obtained during the course of the adventure that add a little complexity to the intense but basic hack-and-slash combat system together with Boost Mode, which can be used to temporarily power-up Adol once a specific meter is full. While combat doesn't evolve much during the course of the game, it doesn't overstay its welcome with its short 12-hour duration, the clever enemy design and the fast pace of the action make it enjoyable for the whole length of the game. As usual for the entire series, boss battles are among the highlights of the experience which push the limits of the combat system and player's skill to the maximum, even at lower difficulty settings.</p>
<p>While combat is a clear previous iteration of mechanics that are still present in the latest entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana feels like a markedly different game from titles like Lacrimosa of Dana or Nordics when it comes to exploration. Instead of featuring a variety of bigger locations that provide plenty of opportunities to stray off the beaten path in search of secrets, The Oath in Felghana is a much more compact and linear experience, as players don't get the opportunity to roam around almost freely, as each location is explored only when the story dictates. There are still plenty of secrets and alternate paths to find, but most definitely not in the same way as the latest entries in the series. What makes traversal nonetheless enjoyable are the platform game mechanics, which require a little bit of skill from the player in using certain abilities to reach normally inaccessible areas and so on. If you have played Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim or Ys Origins, you will find yourself right at home in this regard, as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana employs similar mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Battle_03.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While those who have played through the original PSP release will find a very familiar experience, there are some new additions and quality-of-life improvements that enhance the experience, some lifted from the PC release, others completely new. For example, at the Very Easy difficulty, it is possible to completely skip the Clock Tower segment, which is among the most challenging of the game, if not the most challenging. Turbo Mode is both a quality-of-life improvement and a feature that can up the challenge, as it speeds up the whole game and can make Inferno difficulty even more challenging. Rounding up the new additions are new narrated sequences that better tie the game with the rest of the series, making it feel more like a page in Adol's chronicles like more recent games, newly recorded voice acting for Adol, high-quality character illustrations, which can be switched with the original versions at any time, and enhanced visuals sporting higher quality textures and sprites. These visual improvements, however, are minor and are essentially a resolution bump, so if you already have played the PC version of the game, you shouldn't expect Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana to look any better. Nor sound any better, as the game features three soundtrack options (Original, PC-8801, X68000), which were included in previous versions of the game. Still, it is a great soundtrack featuring some blood-pumping pieces that go extremely well with the game's no-holding-back fast pace.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was mostly meant to free the original game from the PSP prison it was stuck in, regarding consoles, while offering a bunch of new features and enhancements to make it more enticing, and in this regard, the game definitely doesn't disappointing. Those looking for some old-school Ys action will be quite happy to return to Felghana with Adol and Dogi, while those who never had the chance to play the game will find a fast-paced adventure that does not disappointing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was clearly designed to bring the remake of the third entry in the Falcom series to modern consoles, and in this regard, it fully succeeds. The game delivers a fast-paced, no-frills experience that remains engaging from start to finish, enhanced by new features, improved visuals and quality-of-life improvements. However, compared to more recent entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana is a more straightforward game with a relatively simple story and combat system, which may not appeal to those who were introduced to the series through its modern installments.</p>
