			<p>This morning, Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its CEO of nine years, Tero Virtala, will step down from the position, although he will continue to work for the Finnish developer while the studio finds a new leader. Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Markus Mäki has already assumed the temporary position of interim CEO. In a statement, Mäki (who acted as the Chairman of the Board until his new appointment and has now been replaced in that role by Henri Österlund) said:</p>



<p><em>I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.</em></p>



<p>The brief press release does not mention why Virtala stepped down, but this is likely related to the financial disaster that was the launch of FBC: Firebreak. Remedy attempted to break into the cooperative multiplayer segment for the first time but failed spectacularly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review</a>, we had already noted that the game quickly became repetitive and just couldn't keep the players interested for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>In August, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that the game was underperforming compared to the studio's expectations. The developers tried to stage a comeback <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a big free update called Breakpoint</a>, but it wasn't nearly enough. Earlier this month, the Finnish developer had to issue a warning to investors about the lower long-term sales that are now expected from the game. Additionally, they recognized a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million, representing most of the game’s capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights. Consequently, they had to adjust the 2025 operating profit to be negative and below that of 2024.</p>



<p>Remedy will post the full Q3 2025 Business Review in exactly a week, on Wednesday, October 29. Hopefully, the studio won't have to resort to layoffs. Alan Wake 2, although critically acclaimed, also did not sell a lot of copies. The studio's next projects include Control 2 (which is being done <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) and the Max Payne remakes for Rockstar. </p>

			<p>Yesterday, modder mstewart401 uploaded UnrealRTX, a remaster of the classic 1998 first-person shooter game powered by NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unrealrtx/downloads/unrealrtx-full-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on ModDB</a>.</p>



<p>UnrealRTX allows players to experience the full single player campaign (no multiplayer, unfortunately) with fully ray-traced global illumination, dynamic shadows, volumetric lighting and stunning emissive effects that, according to the modder, bring a whole new atmosphere to every level.</p>



<p>The addition of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials means that the surfaces now respond to light with realistic metallics, roughness, subsurface scattering and depth. Specific world geometry and props have also been replaced to enhance fidelity.</p>



<p>The modder revealed that most of the texture replacements were generated using RTX Remix's AI tools. They also used NVIDIA assets from NVIDIA Omniverse to replace the vegetation and add grass to outdoor areas. To do that, they extensively used UnrealED to insert dummy objects, which were later replaced with custom grass models. UnrealED was also used to place new light sources where the original maps had unmotivated lighting. As RTX Remix generally replaces assets globally, mstewart401 used UnrealED to create texture variants that enabled the implementation of emissive lights with different colours and properties to achieve the same in-game texture variation. The modder said that nearly all the emissive maps and around 90% of the height maps were crafted manually in MS Paint by blacking out non-emissive pixels and outlining textures.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The UnrealRTX modder admits the file size (currently at 48.29 GB) is a bit much. The goal is to reduce it by using lower resolution roughness and normal maps, as both are currently set to 8K each, which is probably overkill.</p>



<p>More and more PC classics are being remastered with RTX Remix. Just recently, we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ndt-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA IV</a> (although the latter is still not available to the public).</p>
