			<p>The PS5 Pro update for No Man's Sky actually went stealthily live with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-gets-creepy-the-cursed-halloween-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cursed Halloween update</a>, but back then, no one from the public had access to the console yet. That's changed now, with several teardowns already published. As part of its fresh press release about the new Cross-Save update, the British developer (which had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-absolutely-rocks-says-no-mans-sky-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised</a> Sony's upcoming console) has shared more details about the PS5 Pro patch.</p>
<p>The game will offer a 4K@60FPS mode where the graphics settings have been enhanced compared to the PS5 and even an 8K@30FPS mode. This is largely thanks to the PSSR, which they also praised while labeling the hardware as a whole an 'incredible feat of engineering.' Last but not least, the improvements are also coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-fractal-update-psvr2-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS VR2 version of No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>PlayStation 5 Pro releases today and is an incredible feat of engineering. We were so excited to get our hands on it from the early days of development. We couldn’t wait to see what was possible in No Man’s Sky with so much power at our disposal! </em><em>We're excited to be able to share an enhanced version of No Man's Sky for PS5 Pro with players at launch, bringing even more detail and higher image quality than ever possible on console before.</em></p>
<p><em>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) allows for incredible upscaling to provide crisp 4K resolution at 60fps. No Man's Sky will also be an early supporter of 8K resolution, with the universe looking incredible in 8K at 30fps.</em></p>
<p><em>As well as a much sharper resolution at higher frame rates, the increased power of the PlayStation 5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board. Players on PS5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. </em><em>Not only this, but all of these improvements also come to PSVR2, with our most stunning virtual reality imagery offering an even more immersive experience for Travellers amongst the stars.</em></p>

			<p>Today, Hello Games has released a long-awaited feature for No Man's Sky: cross-save. The small developer said it was a huge undertaking, but it was one of the most requested features from the community.</p>
<p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server was particularly challenging for No Man's Sky, as the workload increases with each platform supported and the length of time people have been playing. Hello Games found that many players had accumulated thousands of hours in their saves, which inevitably made it more complicated for them to implement this feature. For these reasons, they have slowly worked on the technology needed for the cross-save update for over six months.</p>
<p>The rollout begins now with a small number of players. Starting today, all No Man's Sky players can link their different accounts <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. A subset of players will then be able to select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. Over the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks to cross-save, players can play on their console from the comfort of their sofa, continue one of the game's Expeditions on the move with the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their powerful PC rig, and then view it in incredibly immersive virtual reality. No Man's Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save across the following platforms: PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2 and PC VR.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/No-Mans-Sky-Normany-Screen-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's not all, as today's update marks the return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-comes-to-no-mans-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with BioWare's Mass Effect franchise</a> on N7 Day. Starting today and for the next two weeks, No Man's Sky players are getting another chance to meet the SSV Normandy SR1 in a reworked version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-looks-glorious-with-ray-tracing-reality-redemption-and-other-mods-in-new-8k-video.1029558/</guid>

			<p>The recently released PC version of Red Dead Redemption doesn't feature any significant improvement over the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports, but thankfully, modders are already coming to the rescue, turning the new version of the glorious open-world game by Rockstar Games into the definitive edition of the game.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video put together by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Digital Dreams</a> shows how much mods like<a href="https://wccftech.com/reality-redemption-overhaul-mod-is-now-available-for-rdr-pc/"> Reality Redemption</a> and ReShade ray tracing can improve the game's visuals and make it feel closer to the proper modern remaster the game deserved but that Rockstar Games did not provide.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K100] Red Dead Redemption remastered with Mods and RAYTRACING | BeyondallLimits gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhufsG0gXd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially being the same game as the one released almost 15 years ago on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Red Dead Redemption, at the very least, runs extremely well on PC. An <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">RTX 4070 GPU</a>, which is far from being a high-range GPU, for example, has no trouble running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, so any other mod coming in the future making big visual changes to the game shouldn't compromise performance even on lower-end machines.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven’t seen Kojima’s vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what’s actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what’s come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director’s Cut, there’s little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima’s vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
