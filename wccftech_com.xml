			<p>Starfield will reportedly launch on PlayStation 5 sometime next year, along with the game's second expansion and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>According to what unspecified sources have told MP1st, the Xbox Series X|S console exclusive from Bethesda will not launch this year on PlayStation 5 as previously rumored, but only in 2026, in part due to the low sales of the first expansion, Shattered Space. At this time, Microsoft is leaning toward releasing Starfield during Spring 2026, together with the second yet-to-be-revealed expansiom and some quality of life improvements. The announcement timeline also doesn't seem to be clear, but it's unlikely the new version of the game will be revealed later this month during this year's Gamescom, nor will it be shadowdropped like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Oblivion Remastered</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>It's not really surprising to learn that Starfield: Shattered Space isn't selling well. While the expansion's tight narrative elements and its atmosphere that borders space horror are very well done, the expansion doesn't offer anything different from the base game. The asking price also doesn't help, as it is too high for what the expansion has to offer, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the base game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 01/08/2025:</strong> Though Nintendo stated it would wait until Sunday, August 3, 2025, to unveil the new prices for the Nintendo Switch and a few specific Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, it seems that the US retailer Target has let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-switch-in-the-us-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, according to <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=nintendo+switch&amp;ignoreBrandExactness=true&amp;Nao=0&amp;facetedValue=551qz">Target's website</a>, the new prices for Nintendo Switch consoles have all increased by at least $30. The new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $339.99 USD ($40 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $229 USD ($30 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $399 USD ($50 up from previous price)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Following a similar announcement at the end of June for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorKwcamh1Em9gwHD9rlcQ7-SZ-YwKnhp8OmOX208TEZnYW1R9bQ">Canada</a>, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">announced </a>that it will change the price of the Nintendo Switch and its "<em>family of systems and products</em>," including the base Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and accessories. Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, will stay the same for now, as will pricing for its peripherals and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced the news on its official website, with a short message that doesn't specifically say how the prices will be altered, but it's unfortunately doubtful that the prices will be decreased. Just as Nintendo did for its Canada announcement, Nintendo says these changes are being made "<em>based on market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>It's also clearly a price increase because while the US price changes will be announced in just a few days on August 3, 2025, Canadians had to wait from June 30, 2025, until today, to find out what the new prices would be. To no one's surprise, they're all price increases.</p>



<p>Before today, the price of a Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite in Canada was:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $399 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $259 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $449 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, everything has been bumped up by at least $20, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/hardware/">the new prices are</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $419 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $279 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $489 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>So expect the cost of getting a Nintendo Switch console in the US to be a little more expensive when these prices go live in a few days. As a reminder, here's what the Nintendo Switch family of systems costs in the US today, before the price increases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $299 USD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $199 USD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $349 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>Nintendo also clarified that while the Nintendo Switch 2 console and most of its peripherals would not be getting a price alteration, some Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like the Alarmo clock and certain Amiibo, will get price adjustments. </p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't getting a price change now, it's a little concerning that the previous generation is getting a price bump. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling extremely</a> well so far, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs</a> potentially behind these price increases, and the Switch 2 proving that players are hungry to jump from their eight-year-old Nintendo Switch console, it makes you wonder when Nintendo will pull the lever on increasing prices for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>In its statement on price changes coming after this weekend, after stipulating that Switch 2 prices are not impacted in the changes announced today, Nintendo says, "<em>However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-system-works-showcases-new-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-in-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide.1259607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls being playable at <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-debuts-at-evo-2025/">EVO 2025</a>, developer Arc System Works has showcased our first extended look at gameplay through a beginner's guide, a fitting delivery method for anyone who plans to be at EVO this year and wants to jump into the ring with at least some knowledge of how things work. </p>



<p>Announced last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, this new fighter from Arc System Works is a new 4v4 fighting game, and while we're sure to see plenty of gameplay when members of the public are able to get their hands on it, this video diving into the basics is the most we've seen of the game so far.</p>



<p>The only unfortunate thing about it is that it's a relatively slow showcase of gameplay, and we see more of only one character, Captain America, than we do of the other fighters that'll be available at launch. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>That said, it's a very thorough guide, and if you are going to EVO with the intent of waiting in line to check out Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, then you could call this video required viewing to ensure you're ready for the fight.</p>



<p>While players will be able to see even more of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls at EVO 2025, and get to play it, they won't get to try it out with PlayStation's new fight stick, which we recently learned is officially called <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a>. The FlexStrike will be at EVO, but behind glass cages for players to look and not touch.</p>
