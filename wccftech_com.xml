			<p>Today, Rockstar has released the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V PC update</a>, which the developer dubbed GTA V Enhanced. This free update is effectively a new version of the game, as you can check in your Steam or Epic Games Store library, where the previous version is now labeled as GTA V Legacy. The distinction makes sense, as the new version has much higher system requirements compared to the original version.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 10 (latest service pack)<br>
Processor: Intel Core i7-4770 | AMD FX-9590<br>
Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 (4GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6400 (4GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: DirectX 10 Compatible<br>
Additional Notes: SSD Required |*Compatible PC and/or device required. 3D Audio via Windows Spatial Sound compatible audio systems</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 11<br>
Processor: Intel Core i5-9600K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600<br>
Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6600XT (8GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: Windows Spatial Sound-compatible audio system; solution containing Dolby Atmos support required for a Dolby Atmos experience<br>
Additional Notes: SSD with DirectStorage compatibility</p>
<p>It's also important to make sure your configuration is up for it since progress can be copied from the Legacy version once, and while you will be able to continue playing from where you left off in GTA V Legacy, progress cannot be copied back. This goes for both Story Mode and GTA Online progress, including Characters, GTA$, Progression, Stats, Vehicles, Properties, Weapons, Clothing, and Player-Created Jobs.</p>
<p>Let's review the bulk of the new features available in GTA V Enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing support, including reflections and shadows (previously released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) and the PC-exclusive global illumination and ambient occlusion</li>
<li>Upscaling support for AMD FSR 1 and 3 and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster load times powered by DirectStorage support</li>
<li>Enhanced 3D audio with support for Dolby Atmos (for those with compatible sound systems) and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers feature, which is enabled to let the player feel directional damage, weather effects, rough road surfaces, explosions, and more</li>
<li>General optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>First things first. Rockstar still didn't add support for High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) displays, which is underwhelming in 2025. The NVIDIA App does not recognize the new version yet, and therefore, tweaking the ApplicationStorage.json file to implement the new DLSS 4 transformer models is not possible. At least Rockstar added built-in support for DLAA, which can be selected directly in-game.</p>
<p>Each ray tracing setting (shadows, reflections, global illumination, and ambient occlusion) can be individually enabled and set up to Ultra. There's also an extra setting called Scene BVH Quality, which maxes out at Very High. Those are the only new settings in the graphics menu. For the testing on my rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition), I pushed every setting to the max, including High-Resolution Shadows and Extended Shadows Distance.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA V Enhanced 4K DLAA RT Maxed Gameplay - RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cMF8tgUvrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After jumping into the game, the visual upgrade over the vanilla version of Grand Theft Auto V was immediately clear. By far the two most impactful enhancements are ray traced global illumination and reflections, which literally elevate the graphics of most scenes to an entirely new level of fidelity. Of course, when you look closely, you can still see that the models and textures are from a relatively old game. For that, you'll need to use mods, though that might only fly for the single-player mode now that Rockstar has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the kernel-level anti-cheat BattlEye to combat cheating in GTA Online.</p>
<p>Still, there's no doubt that GTA V Enhanced is the best the game has ever looked. On the aforementioned rig, the game also runs smoothly, even without Frame Generation (which should be added in a future update, said Rockstar), reaching 123 average frames per second in a free-roaming session of around 20 minutes. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation could potentially triple this result. I would be particularly interested in bumping these 1% low and 0.1% Low to get a more consistent experience, though.</p>

<p>GTA V Enhanced is definitely a way to entice players to get back into the game just as GTA VI looms on the horizon, but one could also take it as a positive sign for the next game's PC version, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch sooner than expected in early 2026. Support for modern features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS/AMD FSR (and soon Frame Generation), Dolby Atmos, and the DualSense controller is a step in the right direction for a developer that has too often relegated PC users to second-class citizens, as evidenced by the huge delay of this 'Next-Gen' update compared to consoles.</p>
<p>However, there's still work to do. For example, whether you own the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store, you still need to pass through the dreaded Rockstar Games Launcher and this affects the DLSS version, too, since the Launcher replaces the DLSS file with the default version if you've updated it to a newer one. Thankfully, there's already a mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/1199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on the Nexus</a> that monitors the GTA V Enhanced process and replaces the DLSS file automatically when the game is started, restoring it to the original upon quitting the game. This is exactly the kind of stuff that annoys PC gamers; Rockstar should take note for GTA VI.</p>

			<p>Acclaim was once an incredibly important company within the games industry, and it soon became legendary after being founded in 1987 for helping to publish titles such as Mortal Kombat, Turok, and NBA Jam. After more than two decades, Acclaim is making a return and has come back with a bold and brave mission in the face of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">tumultuous industry</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher is making a comeback with a focus on supporting indie developers, as well as helping to reignite beloved classic franchises. In this, Acclaim will provide the necessary resources which includes funding, marketing and PR support to independent studios that otherwise wouldn't have been given the opportunity to do so in a highly saturated and chaotic market.</p>
<p>One of the main goals Acclaim will have going forward is to resurrect some classic IP out there that has been enjoyed over the years by a global audience. To be able to make this work, Acclaim has assembled an advisory board with some of the most esteemed industry leaders, such as Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p>
<p>To ensure the longevity of the company going forward, Acclaim has key partners in Phil Toronto, Partner at VaynerFund, and Eric Vogel, Partner at JET Management, which will help the publishing company foster a healthy investment environment for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," says two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarret. "From my early involvement with the publisher's 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>In addition to these industry legends, Alex Josef is spearheading the relaunch of Acclaim as CEO, an industry veteran who has over two decades of experience in marketing and game publishing across PC, console, and mobile.</p>
<p>"It's an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Alex Josef. "We're fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we've already signed some incredible indie titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
<p>The website for Acclaim has its missions at the forefront, as well as a tab for <a href="https://playacclaim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>, which will be coming soon.</p>
