			<p>Reliable insider billbil-kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 should launch on November 14, echoing the previous rumor shared by TheGhostofHope last month on X. Billbil-kun however added that there won't be a version of the Nintendo Switch 2, and there is no information on whether Activision Blizzard plans a later port of the game for the console.</p>



<p>The question arose within the Call of Duty community because back in February 2023, Microsoft, during its efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a ten-year deal with Nintendo to bring the popular first-person shooter franchise to the Switch platforms. So far, no Call of Duty game has been released on Nintendo consoles. With the release of the Switch 2, it should certainly be easier to bring new titles to the freshly released hardware; after all, Black Ops 7 is also coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it's been established that the Switch 2 is more powerful than Sony's and Microsoft's previous generation consoles. Still, there are clearly some hurdles to be overcome first.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will also be released in physical editions on consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X) at the price of â‚¬79.99. According to billbil-kun, pre-orders will be opened on Wednesday, August 20, right after Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live event. </p>



<p>The game itself is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software. The campaign follows the events seen in 2012's Black Ops II. Ten years later, David Mason (voiced once again by Milo Ventimiglia) and his team of agents will pursue "a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else". Of course, there will also be plenty of multiplayer modes, including a round-based cooperative Zombies mode. When it comes to gameplay, the developers promised an evolution of the omnimovement system seen in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
