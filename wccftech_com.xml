			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch lineup mainly consists of existing games ported to the new console, with very few exceptions, and one of them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-will-run-at-4k60-with-hdr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST FUSION</a>.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity racing game series made by Munich-based developer Shin'en Multimedia is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. The first installment, FAST RACING LEAGUE, debuted on the Wii in May 2011. FAST RACING NEO then launched on the Wii U in 2015, and an enhanced version of that game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fast-rmx-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST RMX</a> debuted as a launch title for the Switch in March 2017.</p>
<p>FAST FUSION is also a launch title. However, this time around, it's a brand new installment with new features like Hyperjumps and Vehicle Fusion. As usual, it'll also be a technical showcase, and the studio has already shared that it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with High Dynamic Range support. Jack Merluzzi, the announcer known for his work on F-Zero GX, is returning from FAST RACING NEO.</p>
<p>We sent Shin'en Multimedia a few questions to learn more about their new game and discuss their experience with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you start working on your Nintendo Switch 2 game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We have been working since 2024 on the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Wow, that's not long at all. Were you really able to make FAST FUSION in just one year, or was it in development before?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The game wasn't in development before, but as we work on our own tools and engine and had done several FAST games before, we were able to speed up development a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>After some time with the new hardware, what was the most impressive&nbsp;new feature for you and why?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The new GPU features are, of course, most interesting to us from a developer's perspective. Having an HDR compatible display now makes quite a big difference in our game's look.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? How are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the new HD rumble is very impressive. We use it in many places in FAST FUSION and it intensifies the action quite a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What are the main improvements that players will notice in FAST FUSION over the previous installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>First of all, players will of course notice the much more detailed, alive and vibrant tracks, but the new core elements like Vehicle Fusion and Hyperjumps are what take Fast Fusion to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How will the Vehicle Fusion feature work?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can use any vehicles you acquired in the game for Fusion (just by playing, we have no microtransactions). With Vehicle Fusion, you bring together two vehicles of your liking to create a hybrid of both. So you can, for instance, fuse a fast vehicle with low acceleration with a heavy vehicle that has fast acceleration. The new vehicle will combine the best of both worlds. Also, the looks of both vehicles will be merged into a totally new one.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Very interesting. Can't wait to try it. Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025 globally. Nintendo won't be providing pre-release review units and codes to the press, but look forward to our reviews of the new hardware and some of the launch games later in June.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-main-story-hook-may-not-be-widely-appreciated-%E2%80%93-rumor.1197351/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>HLX, the game rumored to be the long-anticipated Half-Life 3, will feature a main story hook that may not be widely appreciated, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life subreddit</a>, known leaker GabeFollower commented on the game's main hook during a livestream of another known Valve leaker, Tyler McVicker, saying that he thinks people may not like it. As leakers have been avoiding revealing story details, which are reportedly being discussed online in some circles, no other comment was provided, but it will be very interesting to see why this story hook may prove to be divisive, considering Valve's known rigorous playtesting process.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ks6nbi/gabefollower_claims_that_people_might_not_like/">GabeFollower claims that people might not like the story of HLX (rumored Half-Life 3)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Evol-Chan/">u/Evol-Chan</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/">HalfLife</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even if the main story hook of the game ends up being as divisive as suggested by GabeFollower's recent comment, there's no doubt that it probably wouldn't be a massive problem for a game like Half-Life 3 that many have been waiting for decades. Thankfully, it shouldn't take too long to learn more about this HLX project, rumored to be the third main entry in the series, as the game is undergoing playtesting for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">possible Summer reveal and Winter release</a>. Development is reportedly also close to completion, as the game is playable from beginning to end and the development team is focusing on optimization and polish, with content and mechanics already likely locked.</p>
<p>HLX - Half-Life 3 isn't the only gaming project in development at Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-new-project-tf/">Earlier this month</a>, we learned that another project codenamed Tf is in the works, but being in a very early stage of development, it is impossible to learn what this project will be about.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-9-began-development-as-an-open-world-multiplayer-game-%E2%80%93-rumor.1197336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil 9 began development as an open-world multiplayer game, and though the game was rebooted, the current version retains some of its original premise.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1925562211206103333#m">X</a>, well-known CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem commented on the latest rumors on the yet-to-be-revealed new entry in the survival horror series, revealing that the game started development back in 2017 and was originally meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, an open-world multiplayer game starring Leon Kenney and Jill Valentine set on a fictional island based off Singapore. The reason why CAPCOM was going with such a game was due to Resident Evil VII: Biohazard underperforming at the time, and the desire to make something that was the exact opposite of a game that was not meeting sales expectations. Resident Evil 9, however, didn't remain an open-world game for long. Development was rebooted around 2021 when Resident Evil Village came out, and most of its premise changed, although some elements remain the same, as well as Leon being the protagonist.</p>
<p>Besides revealing these interesting Resident Evil 9 tidbits, Dusk Golem provided a minor update on other series projects in the works. The Resident Evil Zero remake underwent some significant changes around half a year ago, and he believes what another leaker said regarding its reveal timing, which should be soon. In addition, Revelations 3, which was revealed a few years ago via a massive leak, was canceled in 2022.</p>
<p>Very little is known about Resident Evil 9 at the moment, other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. Despite the silence, however, the game is reportedly still set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">a 2025 reveal and a 2026 launch</a>. With plenty of showcases and events in the next few weeks, the wait may finally be over to see how the game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a>, which is reportedly why it is taking so long to release.</p>

			<p>Diablo IV Season 9 will introduce plenty of new content, including new activities, powers, and the return of Astaroth as an endgame fight.</p>
<p>As revealed during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZvEKK9UE_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campfire Chat</a> with members of the development team, Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, will introduce a new endgame activity called Escalating Nightmares, a series of three Nightmare Dungeons where each dungeon's affixes stack with the next one. Awaiting the end of the third dungeon is an Exalted version of Astaroth that will surely provide an excellent challenge. To take part in the Escalating Nightmares activity, players will need to use Escalation Sigils, which can only be found inside Horadic caches found in Horadric Strongrooms, small dungeons found in Nightmare Dungeons. Another reward available for completing Horadric Strongrooms is Horadric Attunement, which can be exchanged for rewards. Every Horadric Strongroom allows players to choose between different challenges, providing a decent level of variety.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Season 9 will also feature the introduction of Horadric Spellcraft. This system allows users to create spells by combining three elements - Catalysts, Infusions, and Arcana. The first will determine the base, unmodified power, while the second and the third change the elemental property and enhance the base power of the spell. This system feels like a new variant of systems seen in previous seasons, so those who have been playing the game for a while and have engaged with its seasonal content shouldn't have too many problems getting to grips with it.</p>
<p>Beyond the new content coming with Season 9, the Diablo IV developers also outlined some of the changes coming to dungeons of both the Seasonal and Eternal Realms variety. In the new season, players can activate Nightmare Sigils from inside Nightmare Dungeons once complete, allowing them to go through a completed dungeon without having to exit it first. Nightmer Dungeons affixes are also getting expanded, and the new affixes will be available in both Seasonal and Eternal Realms Dungeons. All the new content and the changes outlined above will become available for testing next week on May 27th, when the 2.3.0 PTR patch goes live.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
