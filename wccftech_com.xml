			<p>EA Sports FC 26 arrived <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">last month on September 26, 2025</a>, and in less than two weeks from its arrival on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, according to a report from <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/alineaanalytics/p/septembers-top-playstation-games?r=1h8120&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">Alinea Analytics</a>, the latest iteration of EA's annual football game has already sold <strong>10 million copies</strong> across all platforms in less than two weeks.</p>



<p>That's the kind of start you can't exactly scoff at, even for a title like EA Sports FC, which is expected to hit these kinds of sales numbers, and more, every year. According to the report, 60% of those 10 million copies sold came from PlayStation players. </p>



<p>Beyond EA Sports FC, Alinea Analytics also reports that September was a sports-focused month, with NBA 2K26 being the other top-selling game for the month, hitting over 6 million copies since its debut, with 2 million of those coming from PlayStation players in September.</p>



<p>In the number three spot, below EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26 for September's best-selling games on PlayStation, is where Borderlands 4 landed, while Hollow Knight Silksong came in at the number four spot. Other notable inclusions in the top-10 best-selling games on PlayStation for September 2025 include Silent Hill f at number 10, Dying Light: The Beast at number eight, EA Sports FC 25 at number seven, and Grand Theft Auto V at number five.</p>



<p>Of those titles, Wccftech reviewed Dying Light: The Beast and Silent Hill f. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">the former, we wrote that</a>, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>



<p>And <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">for the latter, we wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

			<p>To say that Bungie has had a bad couple of years would be an understatement, in many ways. Despite the small boost that came along with Destiny 2: The Final Shape,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/"> layoffs</a>, scandals <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">around stolen work</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">reports of poor and greedy leadership</a> overshadow anything positive the studio has going on.</p>



<p>The latest negative tally to add to the pile comes from a report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-steam-franchise-history-bungie-trust/">The Game Post</a>, which points to Destiny 2's <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660#1m">Steam Chart numbers</a>, which hit an all-time low for the game since its release on Steam in 2019. It should be said that Steam numbers aren't everything, but it's still not necessarily a good look for Destiny 2 to be in such a low place <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">after the recent launch of its Edge of Fate expansion</a>, and ahead of a very major <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">Star Wars expansion called Renegades</a>, which is due out this coming December.</p>



<p>Per the Steam Charts, Destiny 2's monthly average was 18,349 players when The Game Post published its report. At the time of this writing, the average is listed at 18,100 players for the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Is a Star Wars expansion the medicine Bungie needs for Destiny 2 to turn player counts like this around? It could be. Technically, anything is possible. Whether it will is an entirely different question. Even if the idea of wielding a lightsaber gets players to pick Destiny 2 back up, or even to try it for the first time, one of the game's lasting issues has been how obtuse it is to get into or get back into, even if you are a returning player.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, the studio just yesterday announced that it is hosting <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">a closed technical test for Marathon that players can sign up for</a>, and Pete Parsons, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">who was at the studio's helm for years, has left his role and retired</a>. </p>
