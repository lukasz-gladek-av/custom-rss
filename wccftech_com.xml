			<p>As any PC gamer who played some Battlefield 6 during the recent beta test weekends will have already noticed, there is no trace of ray tracing options whatsoever in the graphics settings. That, alongside the complete absence of any mention from the developers, was already more than telling. However, just to be absolutely certain, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook.com</a> got the chance to ask Christian Buhl, who is the Studio Technical Director at Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA, the team working primarily on the Portal mode). Buhl confirmed that ray tracing was not considered and is probably not making it into the game in the near future, either.</p>



<p><em>No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either. That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as optimized as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, it does feel a bit of a downgrade when you consider that Battlefield V was one of the first PC games to support ray tracing back in 2018, specifically for the reflections. Three years later, the ill-fated Battlefield 2042 offered ray traced ambient occlusion. However, Buhl is definitely right that a competitive multiplayer shooter should focus first and foremost on performance.</p>



<p>Players have clearly appreciated that, turning the Battlefield 6 beta into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest ever registered for this franchise</a>. GeForce users can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further accelerate performance</a> with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. AMD users can enable FSR 3 with FSR Frame Generation, and Intel users can select Intel XeSS with XeSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10.</p>
