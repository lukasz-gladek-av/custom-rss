			<p>The Game Awards 2025 might've received <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999330579041730881">a 'D' grade from viewers who voted in the poll</a> that the show's host and creator, Geoff Keighley, puts up on X (formerly Twitter) every year, but that didn't get people to turn away from the show. Keighley and his Game Awards team have, as they do every year, reported the viewership numbers from this year's show. Just like last year, it's another record-breaking year.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 was the most-watched Game Awards ever, with 171 million livestreams of the entire show across the globe. Viewership was up 11% compared to last year, conversation about the show on X (formerly Twitter) was up 12% compared to last year, and there were 23,000 co-streams of the show across Twitch and YouTube, which is more than a 50% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p>And all of that doesn't even include the viewership numbers from Amazon Prime Video, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">as the show made its Prime Video debut this year</a> as one of the streamer's live events. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for making 2025 the most-watched <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> ever.</p><p>📈 Viewership up 11% YoY<br>🌍 171M+ global livestreams of the full show<br>💬 Conversation on X up 12% YoY<br>🎥 23,000 co-streams on Twitch &amp; YouTube (+50% YoY) <a href="https://t.co/8ZL95TIsPS">pic.twitter.com/8ZL95TIsPS</a></p></div>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/2001382103880249581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The show is undeniably the biggest event of the year within the video games industry, even if it's not the most impactful to the industry, and it has continuously grown exponentially for years now. It's a credit to Keighley and his team that they are able to improve on the show's viewership and reach every year, even if the content of the show itself fluctuates far more than anyone would like to see.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">At Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Playground Games and Turn10 announced its next installment in its series of Forza games with Forza Horizon 6, which will be set in Japan and will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2026. Now that we know what the studios have lined up next, they confirmed the inevitable, though still disappointing news for players, that Forza Motorsport will no longer receive new content updates.</p>



<p>The news was buried in <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-year-in-review-2025">a lengthy blog post on the official Forza website</a>, which provided a recap for the year with some community highlights and a look back at what was added to Forza Horizon 5 and Forza Motorsport.</p>



<p>Shifting to focus on Forza Horizon 6's development was the reason cited by the studios, writing, "<em>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime</em>."</p>



<p>At least players can still look forward to competitions in the new year and will get the chance to grab reward cars they may have missed the first time they came around. Forza Motorsport has always offered more of a simulation-based experience compared to a slightly more arcade-y feel in Forza Horizon, so it's good to know that servers and in-game events aren't going away for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Turn10 and Playground Games have to try and ensure they live up to the expectations players have for Forza Horizon 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/">and the expectations they're setting for themselves</a>. According to a recent rumour, we'll be able to see if Forza Horizon 6 hits its mark <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">when it arrives sometime in the first half of 2026</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Physical Video Game and Hardware Sales In November In the US Were The Worst They’ve Been Since November 1995]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/</link>
            <guid>1386439</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>December might be home to Christmas, Boxing Day, and the rush to buy presents for loved ones for a significant portion of the world, but November is no slouch, particularly because of Black Friday. This year, however, November was not a booming and bustling month for game sales in the US, at least for physical game sales and hardware sales, according to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">latest Circana report from executive director Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, physical game sales and hardware sales were the lowest they've been in the US since November 1995, as total spending across video games, hardware, and accessories came in at $5.9 billion, a 4% drop compared to November 2024.</p>



<p>Hardware spending specifically dropped to $695 million, a 27% drop compared to last year. November 2025 is now the second-lowest spending total for video game hardware in the US since November 2005, when the total spend on hardware was $455 million.</p>



<p>The number of hardware units was also down to 1.6 million for the month, with the only lower unit total coming from November 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. When it comes to specific consoles, sales for <strong>Xbox Series X/S consoles are down 70%</strong> compared to November 2024. <strong>PlayStation 5 console sales were down 40%</strong>, while Nintendo Switch console sales were down 10%, and that's even including the fact that the Switch 2 is now available.</p>



<p>Spending on accessories also fell to $327 million, a 13% drop compared to November 2024, with spending on controllers specifically dropping 19% compared to last year. Content, which encapsulates actual video game sales, DLC, etc., was the only area that actually went up compared to November 2024, with a 1% growth overall.</p>



<p>That said, physical game sales were down 14% compared to last year, another "<em>all-time low for a November month since tracking began in 1995</em>," Piscatella wrote.</p>







<p>So, what happened to make video game spending drop so much with regard to hardware, accessories, and physical video game sales? Well, according to Piscatella in a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">IGN</a>, it's the fact that the cost of everything, including video games, has skyrocketed in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okay-dont-panic-but-hdd-prices-are-rising-faster-than-they-have-in-years/">and with rising RAM prices</a>, things don't look good for the future.</p>



<p>"<em>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella gave a presentation at Summer Game Fest</a>, where he outlined how the rising cost of essentials in the US would likely impact video game market sales, because consumers would simply have less money to spend on video games when they're worried about paying rent and buying food.</p>



<p>Now, as Piscatella points out, it's not just the rising price of essentials that people need to live on that is driving down video game spending, but the cost of the games and the hardware themselves. In November 2019, the average cost of a console was $239. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">as console prices have risen</a>, not dropped, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">since the new generation launched</a>, even for<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/"> what is now officially previous-gen consoles</a>, the average price for a console in the US is $439.  </p>



<p>It's still too early to tell if this is a one-off bad month or if this is the beginning of a growing trend. We won't know how the December 2025 numbers look until January 2026. That said, these numbers aren't exactly inspiring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-is-now-rumored-to-reduce-the-production-of-rtx-50-gpus/">as memory shortages continue to turn the entire tech industry upside down</a>, it doesn't look like prices will stabilize anytime soon. Unless everyone starts getting paid more, the majority of consumers will continue to be priced out of buying the latest tech, in video games or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Lastly, an update on the best-selling games of 2025 in the US, a figure that we've been tracking most of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/">For October 2025, it was Battlefield 6 that stood at the top</a> of both the monthly charts and the year-to-date charts. </p>



<p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the US for November 2025, it doesn't even crack the top five for the year-to-date premium game sales charts, with Battlefield 6 still atop that list. Battlefield 6 was also the second-best-selling game for the month of November 2025, a clear sign that it has not slowed down its sales momentum in the US.</p>







<p>It's still early to call it, but perhaps Battlefield 6, not Call of Duty, will be the best-selling first-person shooter in the US at the end of 2025. We'll find out next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Larian Said They Were Doing Something Absolutely Everyone Is Doing and Got an Insanely Crazy Sh*tstorm’ – KCD 2 Dev Talks ‘AI Hysteria’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/</link>
            <guid>1386361</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian's admission that they are using generative AI in specific tasks (concept art, placeholder text, and PowerPoint presentations) while making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Divinity game</a> turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive controversy</a>, between the backlash of many fans who swear they won't touch their games unless they backtrack and the studio's own rebuttal and clarification that no AI-made content will reach the final game and no human will lose their job because of it.</p>



<p>Now, the founder and creative director of a fellow RPG developer, Daniel Vávra of Warhorse (the makers of Kingdom Come: Deliverance), has <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001335767499669728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his own thoughts on the topic</a>. Vávra is not one to mince words (see <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his recent open criticism of Obsidian for The Outer Worlds 2</a>), and he went all-out in this case, stating that Larian has just voiced what literally every developer is doing and adding that AI is, at this point, a reality we can't really come back from, despite a hysteria that he likened to people 'smashing steam engines' back at the time of the industrial revolution.</p>



<p><em>This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm. I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't know anything about it, except that I used Topaz Labs to upscale some of the AI elements from KCD1 and some of the old low-res textures.</em> <em>I'm no fan of AI generated art, but anyway, it's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is.</em></p>



<p>Vávra then went on to say that he hates how long it takes, not to mention how many people and how much money are needed, to make videogames nowadays. </p>



<p><em>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I'm all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won't have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they'll have to focus on the essentials. I have ideas for lots of games, but I'm fifty years old and so far it's taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I'm all for it.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially what Larian and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other developers</a> want to use it for. The gaming industry faces a significant challenge with rising budgets and increasingly long development timeframes, and the only viable solution is to smartly apply AI-powered tools where possible to reduce time spent on tedious, repetitive tasks. There is another potential course of action, of course: to greatly reduce either scope, quality, or both. For obvious reasons, none of the developers or publishers believe this would be a winning formula.</p>



<p>In his lengthy X post, the Game Director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance also mentioned other potential use cases of generative AI in gaming, such as RPGs allowing players to ask certain NPCs anything (like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Skyrim mod powered by Inworld AI technology</a>) within the context of that game world. Moreover, he notes that soon AI will do the programming in games, with software architects overseeing that work, and 'resisting this is probably as meaningful as resisting the use of sewing machines in the textile industry.'</p>



<p>Vávra concludes noting that AI may well ultimately bring about the demise of humanity as foreseen in Terminator, but it could also mean that virtually 'anyone, at a fraction of the current cost, will be able to implement virtually any grand idea. Making a game will be as easy as writing a book.' Either way, he says, there's no stopping it.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is the hottest topic not only in gaming but across most industries. Larian's reveal only served to bring it to the forefront of discussion, given their status as a revered developer after Baldur's Gate 3 (though a new attack on the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just came in from several writers who criticized their hiring practices</a>).
