			<p><strong>Kurt Kuhlmann</strong> worked at <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> as a designer for two decades, during which time he was the co-lead designer on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></strong>, a game that could potentially go down in history as the studio's biggest hit ever. He was also known as the series "<em>loremaster</em>," and though he's no longer with Bethesda, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Kuhlmann claims he was in line to lead up <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>, and if he had it his way, we'd be looking at a major <strong>Star Wars</strong>-inspired style of game for the long-awaited entry in the Elder Scrolls series.</p>



<p>Kuhlmann was never officially offered the job of lead designer on The Elder Scrolls VI, but according to him, Bethesda boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">Todd Howard</a></strong> had verbally offered him the role following the completion of Skyrim. In fact, according to Kuhlmann, if not for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a></strong>, we would've gotten The Elder Scrolls VI a lot sooner.</p>



<p>"<em>Of course, after <strong>Fallout 4</strong> we didn't go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then we didn't make TES6, we made Starfield," </em>said Kuhlmann<em>, "which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I've been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience. <strong>Bruce [Nesmith]</strong> and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim</em>," Kuhlmann continued, "<em>I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen</em>. <em>And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead.</em>"</p>



<p>Not being given the lead was what stamped home the reality for Kuhlmann that "<em>what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point</em>," when it finally came to pass that the studio would focus on The Elder Scrolls VI. That, alongside the fact that Bethesda had grown to a point where it functioned in a way that wasn't compatible with how he preferred to operate, contributed to his leaving in 2023.</p>



<p>But if he had been given the lead, and if he had it his way? The story we would've gotten in his version of the game would've been the "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment for The Elder Scrolls. </p>



<p>"<em>I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</em>," said Kuhlmann. By the end of it, the Thalmor, the elven supremacists who were on the fringes of Skyrim's story, would've seemed to have won, save for the player doing something at the very end of the story to leave a hopeful, cliffhanger ending that would lead into The Elder Scrolls VII. "<em>So you've preserved hope for the future, but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march</em>."</p>



<p>Kuhlmann admits that he doesn't believe his idea would've gone far with the rest of the team. Making a game is not like making a movie. After waiting more than a decade for The Elder Scrolls VI, if it ended with evil winning, and a cliffhanger for good potentially succeeding in the next game, which could very well be another decade away, players might not have appreciated it as much as Kuhlmann. "<em>That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years</em>," Kuhlmann said.</p>



<p>Still, it's interesting to hear Kuhlmann's side of the story, and to hear a little more insight into The Elder Scrolls VI, which we've not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">since its far-too-early reveal back in <strong>2018</strong></a>. Now that Starfield is out of the way, at least we know the studio is working on it, as Todd Howard and other Bethesda executives <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">can say nothing more than "<em>it's going</em>"</a> and that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">the game is still "<em>a long way off</em>"</a> when it comes to the game's development progress.</p>



<p>And while Kuhlmann may be right that players wouldn't have loved his Empire Strikes Back, the reality is that no matter what Bethesda does, it won't be able to live up to expectations, as former Bethesda artist <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>Nate Purkeypile</strong> rightly calls the game a "<em>no-win</em>" situation</a>. </p>

			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gryphline-announces-arknights-endfield-pc-beta-test-system-requirements-revealed/">After multiple beta tests</a>, publisher <strong>Gryphline</strong> and developer <strong>Mountain Contour's</strong> action RPG and factory management game, <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, is finally due to launch globally next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> and over <strong>35 million players are pre-registered</strong> and ready for its arrival.</p>



<p>The news came along with a new launch trailer that you can see below, which, based on its comments, is more than successful at getting players hyped up for next week's launch. While the release date was initially revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a></strong> with a live performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xm45NwWOlo">from <strong>One Republic</strong> performing the song featured in the trailer below,</a> at the time of that performance, the game only had 30 million players pre-registered.</p>



<p>This means the game received another <strong>5 million</strong> pre-registrations over the holiday period, which also unlocked the final tier of community rewards for players, <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us#milestone">per the game's official website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the hype trailer above, Gryphline and Mountain Contour also released two more trailers. An Operator story trailer titled "<em>The Five: Sparks that Shatter the Darkness</em>," and a gameplay trailer that shows off a bit of the action and environments players can expect when they jump into the free-to-play action RPG next week. Here's the story trailer:</p>

<p>After Arknights: Endfield's last beta test, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto not only got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming action RPG, but he also got to speak with the game's lead designer and producer. In his preview, Kai wrote, "<em>Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition</em>."</p>
