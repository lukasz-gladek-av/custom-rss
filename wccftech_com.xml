			<p>Today, South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the third and final <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> overview video. While the previous overviews were focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-second-features-overview-combat-depth-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combat</a>, this time the footage puts the spotlight on the game's non-combat activities.</p>



<p>The heart of the player's journey in Crimson Desert will be <strong>in the Greymane Camp</strong>. After losing their homeland, Paelun, to the Black Bears, the faction established this stretch of land in Hernand as their new base of operations.</p>



<p>Although the camp has humble beginnings, owing to the ragged state of the Greymane band at the beginning of the game, it is designed to evolve. <strong>Players can invest the funds and resources they gather on their travels to upgrade the camp's facilities over time</strong>. It is not just a resting point, either, but also a survival hub. Players can cook meals to maintain health, purchase provisions, and engage in farming and ranching to produce essential resources when the wilds of Pywel are unable to provide them. Cooking was also presented in the video as an essential activity rather than a sideline: <strong>hearty meals cooked at the bonfire provide crucial health, spirit, and stamina buffs</strong>.</p>



<p>Perhaps most intriguing of all is the Companion System. As the camp grows, scattered Greymanes (some actively recruited by the players, others arriving on their own) will join to regroup. <strong>These are not static NPCs, according to the developers; they can be assigned roles or deployed on missions across the continent</strong>. Whether gathering wood and ore or thinning enemy ranks in distant, blockaded regions, <strong>these companions actively contribute to the war effort</strong>, even when the player character is miles away.</p>



<p>The villages and cities of Pywel teem with activity. As well as the usual blacksmiths forging weapons and tailors outfitting players for their travels, these hubs offer a glimpse into the region's daily life. <strong>Residents will offer commissions ranging from delivering goods and tracking missing persons to providing protection against bandits</strong>.</p>

<p>We also learn from the overview video that <strong>Crimson Desert features a robust crime system</strong>. Harmful actions against innocents can turn both residents and guards hostile, so layers who choose the life of an outlaw may find themselves forced to fight their way out of towns, pay hefty fines, or even serve time in jail.</p>



<p>We're now exactly one month and one week away from the <strong>March 19</strong> release date.

			<p>Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the new sales milestone of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> also just revealed the final launch date of the <strong>Gothic remake</strong>. The game will need a little more polishing time, the group said, and is now set to ship globally <strong>on June 5, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, a public demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released six years ago</a> as a test to gauge interest in the remake. The reception was positive, despite some criticism of certain aspects of the demo, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>led the Embracer Group to found Alkimia Interactive</strong></a>, which has been working on the Gothic remake ever since.</p>



<p>More than a simple HD "Remaster Plus", <strong>this should be considered a complete reimagining</strong>. The studio recently shared several stories from the development trenches in a "Making Of" series. For example, they faced a fundamental challenge from the start: determining which elements should remain unchanged and which needed expansion or modernization. The original Gothic's strengths, such as immersive open-world design, memorable characters, and systemic interactions, had to coexist with solutions to plot holes, inconsistencies, and unfinished content. To help with that, <strong>Alkimia hired Mattias Filler, a writer from the original Gothic games</strong>, to provide an authentic perspective and tackle those longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Here's an overview of how the folks at Alkimia overhauled the original Gothic in each of the game's main areas:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="art-new-content">Art Direction and New Content</h2>



<p>Early in development, the team <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alkimia-interactive-delves-into-its-approach-to-art-in-the-gothic-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against creating an HD version of the original's art style</a></strong>, instead pursuing believable, realistic visuals, albeit with a dark fantasy edge. The art direction also<strong> draws heavily from Baroque painting across multiple eras</strong>. References cited by Alkimia include <strong>Caravaggio's chiaroscuro</strong>, Spanish tenebrism of Velázquez, the landscape work of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, Flemish Baroque color contrasts from David Teniers the Younger, and Hubert Robert's atmospheric ruins. The team also incorporated influences from the nocturnal scenes of Romantic painter Petrus van Schendel.</p>



<p>The Gothic remake <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes approximately 20-25% new side quest content</a></strong> while expanding original quests with additional options and solutions. Previously empty or underutilized locations received new content, dungeons have been made more interesting, and hidden paths to Gomez's castle offer alternative entry points. <strong>Cut content from the original game is being restored and reimagined where appropriate</strong>.</p>



<p>The writing <strong>maintains Gothic's signature rough, conversational tone</strong>. It's dialogue written the way people actually talk in pub discussions or pen-and-paper RPG sessions, rather than formal medieval speech. The English localization received particular attention because previous versions failed to capture the iconic tone of the German, Polish, and Russian translations.</p>



<p><strong>The narrative has also grown significantly</strong>, with the team working to fix the aforementioned plot holes, improve pacing in later chapters, and give more depth to storylines that felt rushed in the original. <strong>One major expansion involves Orc culture and player interaction with it</strong>. Where the original treated Orcs primarily as enemies to kill after brief story interactions with Ur-Shak and Tarrok, the remake explores their role more deeply, recognizing that the Orc War is the entire reason the prison colony and magical barrier exist in the first place.</p>



<p>The team even <strong>developed a complete Orcish language for the game</strong>, designed to sound harsh and aggressive with trilled "Rs," "ch," and "tz" sounds. The language's grammar was inspired by East Asian languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, keeping words short (one to three syllables) and avoiding articles, grammatical gender, tense markers, and plurals.</p>



<h2 id="simulation-systems">Simulation Systems</h2>



<p><strong>Major story moments now trigger visible changes in the world</strong>, including altered environments and updated NPC routines that reflect the narrative shifts. This addresses one of the original game's problems, where monumental events had very little impact on daily life. Alkimia also said that the Gothic remake <strong>addresses the original's diminishing player freedom in later chapters</strong>. The developers have strived to ensure that multiple paths and choices remain available throughout the game, rather than funneling into a linear conclusion, which would be quite contrary to the game's overall design goals.</p>



<p>The game <strong>employs a full-world daily routine simulation that runs constantly</strong>, even when the player isn't nearby. When approaching NPCs (non-playable characters), <strong>they spawn exactly where they would be based on their schedules</strong>, so players can now encounter templars traveling between the Sect Camp and Old Mine, something impossible in the original.</p>



<p>NPCs also <strong>react systemically to player actions, witnessing crimes, responding to trespassing, and interacting with thrown objects</strong>. New dynamic events include Baal Parvez preaching in the Old Camp to recruit for the Swamp Camp, with nearby diggers stopping their tasks to listen. Characters carry objects, react to weather, and discuss recent events and rumors among themselves.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay-evolution">Gameplay Evolution</h2>



<p>The armor system in the Gothic remake moves away from fixed guild armor sets to a customizable upgrade path. <strong>Players can improve camp-specific armor with different visual elements and defensive properties</strong>, for example adding wolf fur for arrow defense or mobility enhancements while maintaining the aesthetic of their chosen faction.</p>



<p>New abilities expand exploration possibilities beyond the original. <strong>Climbing functions similarly to The Legend of Zelda</strong>, but is limited to specific areas. <strong>Diving is now a proper skill that improves with practice</strong>, allowing players to interact with underwater objects, pick up loot, and explore extensive submerged areas.</p>



<p>The developers emphasized the game's difficulty, <strong>encouraging players to consume items through challenging encounters rather than hoarding resources</strong>. Combat remains unforgiving like in the original, and players can still attempt "silly things" like fighting powerful enemies from the start, staying true to Gothic's philosophy of not holding the player's hand.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration emphasizes the feeling of being lost</strong>, especially at night when darkness becomes oppressive even with torches and light spells. The conversation camera system uses preset shots with environmental checks to avoid clipping through walls or characters, with fully planned cinematography for important scenes.</p>



<p><strong>The Gothic remake implements a dynamic trading system in which merchants passively trade items among themselves</strong>, converting goods into ore to maintain market liquidity. This prevents the player from becoming the central bank and controls material abundance. The studio's economic designer analyzed the original game's patterns to understand its intended progression, identifying where the economy broke down in later chapters. The goal was to delay economic collapse until chapter six through active management, though complete stability is impossible in a closed economy with the player as the only active agent. <strong>Crafting recipes will evolve with player investment</strong>, and the act of crafting itself provides value by converting excess materials into ore while reducing inventory clutter.</p>



<p>The dynamic weather system includes <strong>varying sun intensity and color, cloud cover, rain with fluctuating intensity, storm probabilities, growing waves during storms, lightning illuminating the night sky, and lingering post-storm fog</strong>. The music system uses layers and cues that change based on in-game events rather than a single master track, ensuring players don't tire of the soundtrack during extended play sessions. The composer approached each scene as painting pictures, assigning instruments to visual elements and experimenting with melodies and harmonies to convey specific emotions.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the whole Making Of series is the claim that they've consciously created an art style and systems <strong>"not just for one game, but for an entire new series within the Gothic franchise"</strong>. It definitely sounds like they'd like it to serve as a foundation for future entries beyond this remake, although of course, the necessary requirement will be the successful release of the first one. </p>



<p>It won't be long until we can find out for ourselves. Stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Has Sold 5 Million Units in Its First Year]]></title>

			<p>This morning, during the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>'s <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-528-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 FY 2025/26 report</a> (October-December 2025), it was revealed that <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> game has sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> <strong>in its first year on the market</strong>.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II originally debuted on <strong>February 4, 2025</strong>, so it's been roughly a year and eight days since its release. The historical first-person open world action roleplaying game enjoyed an excellent reception; on Wccftech, reviewer Chris Wray <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded it a rare perfect score</a></strong> and waxed plenty of praise upon the latest work of the Czech studio:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<p>The game also <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to beat Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> in the Best RPG category of the Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, with our staff and readers aligning on this view.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>was updated with free patches and three premium DLCs</strong>, the last of which, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a></strong>, did particularly well, helping the game perform <strong>"well ahead" of the Embracer Group's expectations</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the financial report, the <strong>Dead Island</strong> and <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> IPs also performed better than estimates in the quarter. Even so, net sales <strong>decreased by 26%</strong> year-over-year, and organic growth <strong>also decreased by 8%</strong>. This decline was primarily driven by negative foreign exchange effects and the divestment of Easybrain within the Mobile segment. </p>



<p>Still, Embracer Group CEO <strong>Phil Rogers</strong> stressed that the company is going in the right direction: focusing on its core IPs (Tomb Raider, Dead Island, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and, of course, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a></strong>) while targeting a reduction in both opex and capex and completing its consolidation goals (they recently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</a></strong>). Let's just hope this doesn't mean new layoffs.</p>
