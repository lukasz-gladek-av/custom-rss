			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may get a new story DLC early next year from the studio that's working on the remake of the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1l9gnje/new_witcher_3_dlc_may_be_coming_in_2026_before/">PC Gaming subreddit,</a>&nbsp;well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed during a recent podcast hosted by Remigiusz Maciaszek that the third entry in the series by CD Projekt Red may get an additional story DLC that is being developed by Fool's Theory, the studio that is working on the remake of the first entry in the series, early next year. According to the commentator, this could be the unspecified project from the studio that was mentioned during one of CDPR's earnings calls. Unfortunately, no other information is currently available on this potential story DLC, so it could be a single additional questline, similar to that released for free to celebrate the launch of the horrendous, in my humble opinion, Netflix show, or a longer, paid expansion.</p>

<p>Even if The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt won't get any more content from CDPR, some amazing modding projects in the works will allow players to return to the Continent to experience more stories, or to play through some of the most important events in the life of Geralt of Rivia, before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a>. Among these projects is The Last Wish project, which aims to recreate the book written by Andrzej Sapkowski that includes some fantastic stories, such as the titular The Last Wish. The project's alpha is now available for <a href="https://www.thelastwishproject.com/">download</a>, allowing players to experience the first video game adaptation of The Lesser Evil story and learn why Geralt is called The Butcher of Blaviken. You can check out the alpha before downloading in the video put together by xLetalis.</p>
