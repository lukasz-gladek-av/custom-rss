			<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for its open-world MMO racing game, The Crew, on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855">March 31, 2024</a>. It was unfortunate news, but not particularly surprising in today's modern age of online games having an expiration date of 'whenever the developer decides it can't/won't pay for the servers anymore.' But while the occurrence of online games being shuttered is now commonplace, The Crew's shutdown sparked something more.</p>



<p>It not only sparked a lawsuit that made players more aware than ever that they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">always been buying a license to play a game</a>, instead of a copy of a game. It sparked enough backlash that Ubisoft committed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. It caused enough uproar that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">Valve added a warning to Steam purchases</a>, making it clear to players they're buying a license to play a game, instead of a copy of the game. And, perhaps most significantly, it was the match that lit the flame under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">Stop Killing Games Initiative</a>.</p>



<p>While the Stop Killing Games and the Stop Destroying Videogames initiatives and petitions continue, and the lawsuit two Californian The Crew fans began is still underway, a group called <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">The Crew Unlimited (TCU)</a> has been working hard to bring The Crew back the old-fashioned way, by creating an emulator to run the servers on.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-tcu-release">TCU realized its goal</a>, and players with a copy of the game can jump back into The Crew thanks to their hard work.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you own a copy of The Crew on PC, then you should be able to set TCU up for yourself to continue playing a game that's shutdown seems to have had more of an impact on the videogame industry than it did when it was still being distributed by Ubisoft.</p>

			<p>A couple of hours ago, <span>Initiative Studio Head Darrell Gallagher announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373350179040714752/" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;that he's leaving Xbox. He expressed his pride in the work done by the development team on the Perfect Dark remake</span> despite its final cancellation by Microsoft.</p>



<p><em>After an incredible journey, my time at Xbox has come to a close with the wind-down of Perfect Dark and The Initiative. I couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead. Together, we set out to reimagine an iconic franchise and poured creativity, craft, and dedication into every step of the way. The public reception and excitement for what we were building has been inspiring and deeply appreciated by all of us.</em></p>



<p><em>While this chapter is ending sooner than hoped, the spirit, talent, and achievements of the team will live on well beyond the project. I’m grateful to Xbox for the opportunity, to our partners for their support, and to the community for their belief in what we were creating. I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em></p>



<p>The Perfect Dark project was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> over two months ago, but Gallagher is only formally announcing his departure from The Initiative now because, as Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> earlier this month, there was a last-ditch attempt to save the project by selling the game rights to Take-Two Interactive. Unfortunately, no agreement was ever reached between Take-Two and Microsoft, who could not find common ground on who would remain the long-term owner of the storied franchise.</p>



<p>Gallagher was Studio Head of The Initiative for seven and a half years. Before that, his career includes tenures at Sony, Rockstar, THQ, and Crystal Dynamics, where he began as Director of Art and was then promoted to Studio Head, leading the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, which is the main reason he was picked to reboot Perfect Dark. Between Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative, he worked for two years at Activision as Senior VP and Head of Development. He is credited for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Remastered, Call of Duty: WWII, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Destiny 2, Skylanders: Imaginators, and Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy.</p>
