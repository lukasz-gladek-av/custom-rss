			<p>Publisher HyperTrain Digital and developer Ice-Pick Lodge have announced that Pathologic 3 will arrive on PC this coming January 9, 2026, though if you can't wait until then, there's a demo available to check out now as part of October's Steam Next Fest, which kicked off today and runs until October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>If you're worried about Pathologic 3 potentially being delayed, no need, as Ice-Pick Lodge makes it clear that its January release date is as set in stone as can be in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">a post on the game's Steam page</a>. "<em>That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isn’t moving</em>," the studio writes.</p>



<p>Ice-Pick Lodge also debuted a new trailer for Pathologic 3 as part of the demo's arrival and the announcement of its "<em>nailed down, screwed in</em>" release date. This trailer does its best to show the many sides of Pathologic 3, to try and give players an understanding of the game's complexities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The demo is a small slice from the beginning of the game, with Daniil Dankovsky arriving in the City-on-Gorkhon, looking for an immortal man.</p>



<p>Pathologic 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/">announced in October 2024 with a 2025 release window</a>, though today's news reveals that Ice-Pick Lodge will just slightly miss that release window by nine days. It's also not the only game with a Steam Next Fest demo, as you can also find demos for <a href="https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/">games like Ash and Steel</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">Lovecraftian survival horror shooter Beneath</a> during the festival. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cloud Imperium Games delivered big news to Star Citizen fans this weekend during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9bXJnkgBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CitizenCon Direct 2025 livestreamed event</a>. The game's third explorable system, Nyx, will launch next month with the Alpha Update 4.4. The system features a hazardous, asteroid-dense environment, the Glacian Belt, with distinctive cold lighting and nebulae. Entry into Nyx will be possible from both the existing star systems: Stanton and Pyro.</p>



<p>According to the backstory developed by CIG, Nyx was initially disregarded by the Empire as unsuitable for terraforming/mining and subsequently became a haven for the revolutionary “People's Alliance.” Levki, its main outpost, mixes frontier spirit with a struggle to survive outside UEE oversight. It returns as a fully explorable social and economic hub, rebuilt with improved interiors, external EVA access, cargo operations, a refinery, a hospital (the Mercy), new markets and shops (Teachers for ships and parts, Cordies for armor, Conscientious Objects for weapons, and Cafe Muse for the social area), and significant visual improvements. While roaming Levki, players will encounter the prominent Anthony Tanaka statue, symbolizing resistance against the oppressive Messer regime.</p>



<p>Two major storylines will be rolled out: Pyro Burn and Science Runner Muk. The latter involves the Empire's regen crisis and the exposure of shady corporate activities, culminating in new missions and mysteries. With the Nyx update, players will also find new mission arcs, such as an urgent investigation of illegal tech and derelict QV Planet Services facilities, featuring combat and narrative branches. The mission structure now includes non-linear missions, social choices (helping NPCs, bugging out, etc.), and persistent replayability. Player exploration will be encouraged to an even greater degree with loot and clues scattered throughout. Moreover, Star Citizen players will fight alien Vanduul ships in the persistent universe for the first time ever, encountering new ship classes like the Vanduul Stinger.</p>



<p>During CitizenCon Direct 2025, CIG also introduced the Genesis group of technologies for planetary and biome generation, shifting from artist-driven placement to physical data-based procedural content (relating to humidity, geology, temperature, seasons, etc.). According to the developers, this change results in much more realistic worlds because terrain, cliffs, biomes, and vegetation are generated following natural criteria, with visible geological logic. This also means instant orbital-to-ground visual authenticity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Citizen | CitizenCon Direct: October 11, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n9bXJnkgBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nyx will also premiere a new resource, medium tiles, which balances high-fidelity detail with scale and rationalizes the placement of rocks, minerals, and obstacles. This is especially relevant for land vehicle operators and miners. CIG shared plans to apply this technology to rework the Stanton and Pyro systems in future patches.</p>



<p>Throughout 2026, Nyx will be expanded further, with more locations, system-specific features, and ongoing incremental updates. New gameplay loops and content will roll out in an episodic fashion, organically shaping narrative and discovery in the new Star Citizen system.</p>



<p>Just in case you were wondering, no, there were no mentions at all of version 1.0. In August, Game Director Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the space simulation game could launch in 2027 or 2028. The single player campaign, Squadron 42, is currently targeting a 2026 release, although Content Director Jared Huckaby candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that, as with any game, there's always a chance of a delay.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In what's become a very extended waiting period for Crimson Desert <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">after its earliest 2019 reveals</a>, now that we have a release date to look forward to, we seem to keep getting new gameplay looks at the coming open-world action-adventure title.</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfaon2NhA9k">IGN First preview series</a>, the latest gameplay showcase puts another boss fight on display, though this one isn't with a towering knight or angry spirit. This nine-minute gameplay showcase features a boss fight against a giant mechanical dragon.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Crimson Desert: Golden Star Quest Gameplay - IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfaon2NhA9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Crimson Desert was first announced, it was intended to be a new MMORPG. Then, at the 2020 Game Awards, Pearl Abyss revealed a change in direction for the game: it would now be an open-world action-adventure title instead. Following that, the game's first major delay was announced in 2021, with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/">being delayed "<em>indefinitely</em>" at the time</a>. </p>



<p>It was then supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">arrive sometime in Fall 2025</a>, but it was delayed again and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">pushed into 2026</a>. In the meantime, the game kept appearing at annual shows like Gamescom (<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's event</a>) with new gameplay showcases, but no release date news. That didn't arrive until last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">when Pearl Abyss finally confirmed a release date</a> for Crimson Desert, with the game arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 19, 2026.</p>



<p>It'll have been a seven-year wait for players to get their hands on Crimson Desert from its reveal to its arrival. So long as it's not delayed again, that is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Old-School Open World Fantasy RPG Of Ash and Steel Gets New Demo and November 6 Launch Date]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-new-demo-and-november-6-launch-date.1323769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Fire &amp; Frost and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date of the old-school fantasy open world fantasy roleplaying game Of Ash and Steel. The game will be released for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_ash_and_steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a> on November 6.</p>



<p>Today, though, fans can play the new Steam demo, which features the beginning of Tristan's journey. Players will be able to spend several hours freely exploring the starting region of the game, following the main story and tackling numerous side quests. They can experiment with skill trees and professions, explore the area around the lumberjack camp, and help the lumberjacks with their hard labor. Finally, they can team up with Fox to investigate an abandoned village and find their way to the harbor.</p>



<p>The demo also features Arena Master Mode, where seasoned action RPG players can test their skills and Of Ash and Steel's combat system. This mode features fast-paced arena battles where Tristan can earn experience, gold, and fame. Players should upgrade their weapons and armor, master new techniques, and prove that they are worthy of being called the greatest gladiator in Grayshaft.</p>



<p>Our Francesco De Meo played the previous demo in July, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-a-very-long-journey-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his experience wasn't exactly great</a>, and he noted that Fire &amp; Frost would need a lot of work to make the game noteworthy:</p>



<p><em>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable experience</em>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping that Fire &amp; Frost managed to significantly improve the experience in a short time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox showed up to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">PAX Australia this year to show off some more details</a> about Borderlands 4 and what's up next for the game, with a few new details about its post-launch roadmap, including a teaser reveal for the first Bounty Pack coming to Borderlands 4: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</p>



<p>How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is a paid DLC drop that will arrive on November 20, 2025, which is just in time for its holiday and snow-filled aesthetic. It follows Rush trying to fix his own case of homesickness and restore some holiday cheer in his life by celebrating Mercenary Day, only to have those plans thwarted by Screw, the minister of culture for the Timekeeper. Unsurprisingly, that doesn't sit too well with Rush, and he goes on a hunt to save Mercenary Day and keep his holiday cheerful.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5FY6q7qdkY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This first Bounty Pack will also include new cosmetics for players, from weapon skins to Echo attachments and skins, Vault Hunter skins, and vehicle skins. It also adds four new legendary weapons, and a new vehicle. If you already own the Deluxe or Super Deluxe edition of Borderlands 4, then this Bounty Pack will arrive as an update for you on November 20. If not, you'll have to either purchase the Bounty Pack individually or as part of the Bounty Pack bundle.</p>



<p>With regards to upcoming free content, the Horrors of Kairos seasonal mini event is set to kick off on October 23, just in time for Halloween. It'll include the chance to grab a legendary assault rifle, the Murmur, and a legendary grenade called 'Skully.' Gearbox is also adding a new challenge for players to take on with Bloomreaper the Invincible, a new raid boss that will enter the fray at some point in December 2025.</p>



<p>These new bits of DLC and seasonal events cover the rest of what's to come to Borderlands 4 in 2025, with the game's first major story expansion currently set to arrive sometime in Q1 2026. You can see the newly updated roadmap below</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4 2025 Post-Launch Roadmap. Image credit: Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully, by then, Gearbox will be able to iron out most of the major issues Borderlands 4 launched with. The last patch from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-patch-fixes-performance-degradation-pc-introduces-vault-hunter-buffs/">studio arrived earlier this month</a>, addressing more performance issues as well as introducing new balancing tweaks for Vault Hunters. </p>



<p>Maybe we'll even have some news on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">which was indefinitely delayed shortly after the game's poor technical launch on PC and current-gen consoles</a>. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-now-bundled-base-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-is-now-bundled-with-the-base-game-to-celebrate-season-10-launch.1323727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, alongside the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 10: Nighthaven</a>, Amazon Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/521978797993492570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the New World DLC Rise of the Angry Earth is now free for all players.</p>



<p>Rise of the Angry Earth originally launched in October 2023 and has remained priced at $29.99, save for discount periods. It added a level cap increase, a new gear rarity, an endgame Expedition, a Heartrune ability, though its capstone feature was undoubtedly the addition of player mounts. Before that, players were forced to roam the vast world of Aeternum on their feet. This DLC did not encounter widespread adoption, though, and to this day it had remained a barrier to new and returning players, who wished to access mounts (and the rest of the content) without having to pay such a steep price.</p>



<p>Given the positive vibe around Season 10: Nighthaven, Amazon Games rightfully thought to remove this barrier for all those interested in playing New World. Of course, there's the issue of those who recently purchased Rise of the Angry Earth, but Amazon prepared a FAQ for that scenario:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>How can I get access to the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>For PC players who have purchased the New World base game but have not previously purchased the expansion, you should automatically receive the expansion. This will not require a separate download. Once the Season 10 update has been downloaded, players will be able to play all of the content in New World: Aeternum.</li>



<li><strong>What if I recently purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion? Can I get a refund?</strong></li>



<li>Any PC player who purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion in the past 30 days will receive a refund on their purchase. Steam will automatically process refunds. Players should not have to take action to get a refund. For eligible players, please allow up to 72 hours to receive your refund.</li>



<li><strong>If I’ve purchased New World: Aeternum, do I need the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>No. The expansion is only for PC players who purchased the original base game on Steam prior to New World: Aeternum’s release in 2024. All the content from the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion is already included in the New World: Aeternum game.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New footage reportedly showing the Leon campaign in Resident Evil Requiem may have already been released, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who, despite a mixed track record, <span>has proven to have access to insider information regarding the survival horror series by CAPCOM in the past</span>, Leon is already in the&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem first trailer&nbsp;in two small ways. According to the insider, they are minor but more obvious when looking back.</p>



<p>Besides discussing Leon's small appearance in the Resident Evil Requiem first trailer, Dusk Golem also mentioned that, from what they understand, most players will play as Leon. This seems to suggest the game won't have separate campaigns for Grace and Leon but a single, larger campaign featuring both characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon is in the first trailer, in two small ways, but they're minor and be more obvious when looking back.<br>While this is subjective, I believe with how the game is structured that more of the game will be played as Leon by most players from how I understand it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1976775421728637017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As there's still no official indication that Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem, we have to take what Dusk Golem said with a massive grain of salt. However, there could be some truth to the insider's latest statements. On X, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Persian">@RE_Persian</a> took a good look at what could be one of the sequences where footage lifted from the Leon campaign is shown. The footage strongly suggests the cutscene is from a first-person point of view that is not Grace's, as what seems to be her hair appears on one side of the screen, which wouldn't happen if it were her POV.</p>

			<p>Beneath, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593230/Beneath/?curator_clanid=34817714">Lovecraftian-themed survival horror shooter</a> from developer Camel 101 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/">publisher Wired Productions</a>, finally has release dates set for its arrival on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. It'll arrive on PC on Steam this coming October 27, 2025, with its console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 coming the following day on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>Players would recognize Camel 101 from previous games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/715380/Those_Who_Remain/">Those Who Remain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/409320/Syndrome/?curator_clanid=34817714">Syndrome</a>, the former of which was also published by Wired Productions. Alongside the news of the game's full release, Camel 101 has also released a demo for the game on Steam as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">October Steam Next Fest</a>, which officially kicks off today, October 13, and runs until October 20.</p>



<p>Camel 101 also debuted a new launch trailer for Beneath, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>Beneath is a single-player shooter that sees you step into the shoes of Noah Quinn, a veteran diver who finds himself trapped under the ocean on what should have been a routine dive. Now, he has to contend with all sorts of horrors with whatever weapons and ammo he can find in this survival horror adventure.</p>



<p>With the third iteration of Steam Next Fest set to kick off today, Beneath isn't the only game you'll find with new demos available on Steam starting today. Also, don't be too concerned if you miss the festival, since several of the demos, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">including ones that we checked out back in June</a>, often aren't taken down once the festival is officially over. So if you know you won't have a moment over the next seven days to sit down and play some demos, mark what looks interesting and come back later - it will likely still be available to play and check out. </p>
