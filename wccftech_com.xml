			<p>Tomorrow, Bethesda Game Studios will open up the gates of the Fallout 76 PTS (Public Test Server) to allow fans to play as a Ghoul for the first time in the franchise, likely in response to the massive acclaim enjoyed by the TV show's Cooper Howard character played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they shared a few details with the press. Playing as a Ghoul (with customizable design and even skin texture) is an endgame experience, as the related quest only starts at level 50. Ghouls will have 'dozens of alternate ways' to specialize their character, according to the developers.</p>
<p>To begin with, they are not only immune to radiation; it actually heals them. If your character is hurt, standing on top of some radioactive material will start healing them. Moreover, once fully healed, the excess radiation will build up into a new resource called Glow. Depending on how the player character is specialized, Glow can provide various effects. Ghouls can also utilize 32 exclusive perk cards on top of those already available for human characters, providing great variety when it comes to character progression.</p>
<p>Ghouls do not feel hunger or thirst in Fallout 76. However, they must manage a feral meter instead. If a character turns full feral, they'll suffer from drawbacks like reduced hit points and worse accuracy with weapons, but they'll also get a boost in hand-to-hand combat, potentially unlocking a berserker type of playstyle.</p>

<p>Many NPCs (non-player characters) and factions will interact differently with player ghouls, such as the Brotherhood of Steel, who do not take kindly to ghouls. You won't be blocked from their stories, though; instead, this will reportedly open up new narrative paths to experience. Bethesda also said there will be in-world ways to disguise your being a Ghoul. Last but not least, player Ghouls will have the ability to revert to human form, though you will only be able to do this once for free.</p>
<p>There's no final release date for this update yet, although the developers aim to launch it sometime in early 2025. As a reminder, Fallout 76 was recently updated with a brand new raid experience called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMO-style endgame dungeon</a> where a party of four players must go through five tough encounters to obtain the new four-star legendary weapons.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED did a veritable press tour for The Witcher IV reveal after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer's debut at The Game Awards 2024</a>. After talking about Ciri as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protagonist</a>, revealing her new voice <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>, and confirming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwent</a>, the developers stopped by for an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel Skill Up</a>. Here, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba discussed the game's scope, which is said to be similar to The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p><em> I'll give you guys an anecdote first before I answer the question. I remember when we were thinking about how many hours you would need to, let's say, finish The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. When we threw the numbers, we were like, maybe 5 or 10 hours for Heart of Stone and maybe 10 or 15 hours for Blood and Wine, and we ended up with 30 hours. Of course, empirically, we have so much knowledge regarding the structure of The Witcher 1, 2, 3, the structure of Cyberpunk 2077 and all the expansions, so we use this data. But we look at the scale a little differently. We don't want to be servants to the numbers. </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the map of The Witcher IV is definitely more or less the same when it comes to the size.</em> <em>The amount of quests is also more or less the same, but again, the game is going to be big, but also, the ambition of the entire team is huge. First and foremost, we want to deliver a super compelling experience. So, again, quality over quantity. But definitely, what we can promise is that, yes, this game is going to be pretty big. It's going to be comparable to everything we've done so far, but I cannot tell you if it will be 90%, 85%, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>For the record, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is definitely a huge game. The main story alone can take over 50 hours, and with all the side content, it goes easily above a hundred hours, even if you don't want to complete every single hunt and Easter egg. Still, Kalemba emphasized the studio's focus on quality.</p>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated addendum, the Game Director of The Witcher IV also stressed that this is not the beginning of the game's marketing campaign. It was simply a reveal of the title and the new protagonist. The game entered full production earlier this year, so there's still a long wait ahead for fans - probably a couple of years, if not more.</p>
