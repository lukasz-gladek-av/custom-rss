            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <strong>Amazon</strong> killed <strong>New World Aeternum</strong> by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game</a>, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/">delisting the game</a></strong> as of today, <strong>January 15, 2026</strong>. Second, by announcing that the game will go <strong>offline on January 31, 2027.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">A blog post on the official New World website</a> begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "<em>provide transparency on where the game goes from here.</em>" Which, essentially, is nowhere. "<em></em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. </p>



<p>If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until <strong>July 20, 2026</strong>; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that <strong>refunds will not be available</strong> for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life.</p>



<p>New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon's mass <strong>14,000+ company-wide</strong> layoff last year</a>. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising.</p>



<p>It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-has-hit-100000-concurrent-players-regularly-since-launch-of-fresh-start-servers/">huge player numbers</a></strong>, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion</em>," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "<em>We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been our pleasure to work on </em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days after renowned game designer <strong>Chris Avellone</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that <strong>Bethesda</strong> didn't truly understand the <strong>Fallout</strong> franchise, the lead developer of <strong>Team FOLON</strong> (the studio that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched <strong>Fallout London</strong> in July 2024</a>), <strong>Dean Carter</strong>, <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/industry/fallout-london-creator-bethesda-elder-scrolls-vi-fallout-5-gta-london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Esports.net</a> that he feels Bethesda should sell off their IPs (Fallout and also <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>). His dissatisfaction stems mainly from the writing of the most recent games and from the release of Fallout 76, which obviously didn't cater to single player fans.</p>



<p><em>With the greatest respect to Bethesda, I feel like they’ve probably gone one game too far, if I’m honest. I feel like it’s time to go off into the sunset and look at selling off your IP because people like the franchise, I’m just honestly not sure it’s in the right hands, and it really hurts me to say that because I love Bethesda.</em> <em><strong>The writing has just gone downhill</strong>. I know as a company, they have to try new things, but Fallout 76 caters to an audience, but it doesn’t cater to the people who want to play a single-player Fallout game. </em></p>



<p>However, Carter does add that if Bethesda could add some talented writers to their team, their next games could still be great.</p>



<p><em>I think if they’re gonna stay on board, they can stay with what they’ve got. I don’t think Skyrim is the best game of all time, like some people. It’s a very, very good game. I just feel like they need to improve the writing, I really do. <strong>I reckon if they could inject in the quality of some good writers, then the next Elder Scrolls game will be great and the next Fallout game will be great</strong>, but they need better writers, honestly.</em></p>



<p>The TEAM FOLON lead then said he's 'worried' Bethesda will keep using the <strong>Creation Engine</strong> in future games, although he clarifies it's not actually a bad engine:</p>



<p><em>I understand that it is proprietary. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of pluses to it. I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine. It could be better, yes, but it’s not a bad engine but I do think it started to show its age. It needs to be overhauled somewhat.</em></p>



<p><em>If they can overhaul it, then there’s no reason why they couldn’t push its limits and start adding things like drivable cars, maybe even metro systems like what we built in Fallout: London. I mean, if we found a way, I’m sure they could bring some of this stuff back into Fallout 5.</em></p>



<p>After the successful release of Fallout London, Team FOLON has registered as an official game developer and is now working on a new indie project built on <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>. However, they'll still release the last two planned Fallout London DLCs: Last Orders and Wildcard.</p>



<p>As for Bethesda, in a recent Fallout 3 retrospective, Studio and Production Director at Bethesda Game Studios <strong>Angela Browder</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-dev-speaks-fallout-3-pre-release-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the pre-release skepticism following their acquisition of the IP was, to some degree, freeing. Needless to say, the team has absolutely no plans to follow Carter's suggestion <span>to sell their prized franchises and is instead doubling down on them, with <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>&nbsp;next in</span> the pipeline. Given the studio's track record and the fact that their previous game, <strong>Starfield</strong>, launched in September 2023, a debut between late 2027 and 2028 seems likely. </p>

			<p>Right at the end of 2025, as <strong>Amazon's</strong> second season of its successful <strong>Fallout TV show </strong>adaptation was airing, a report appeared to identify the next TV show adaptation Amazon would be pulling out of the Fallout franchise: <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show/">a reality TV show competition based on <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong></a>. Well, that report has been proven true, as Amazon confirmed today that it is developing a reality TV competition show based on Fallout Shelter, where contestants will test their nuclear apocalypse survival skills for a cash prize.</p>



<p>The news was revealed in a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a>, which confirmed that the series will begin with <strong>10 episodes</strong> and that <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting for the series has officially opened</a>. According to the show's logline, this new reality TV competition show is "<em>Set inside Vault-Tec’s bomb-proof vaults, ‘Fallout Shelter’ drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games’ signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling. Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork, and resilience as they compete for safety, power, and ultimately a huge cash prize</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers!

</div></figure>



<p>The casting page for the show adds that contestants will be tested on challenges all to do with seven core attributes players can upgrade in the games: Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). </p>



<p>"<em>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances</em>," the casting page reads. "<em>It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?</em>"</p>



<p>The report adds that the show will feature "<em>deeply social, psychological, and narrative-driven gameplay</em>," to match the "<em>choice-driven ethos</em>" of the games. Bethesda's <strong>James Altman</strong> and <strong>Todd Howard</strong> are both signed on as executive producers on the show, alongside Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, Jack Burgess, Toni Ireland, Stephen Yemoh, Stephen Lovelock and Amina Badresingh from Studio Lambert.</p>
