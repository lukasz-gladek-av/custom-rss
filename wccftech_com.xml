			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/08/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-1/">confirmed the next batch of games</a> coming to Xbox Game Pass for October 2025, which is also the first batch of titles to come in under the new changes Microsoft and Xbox recently made to the service, specifically <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">the fact that prices were raised by 50% for a Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>Twelve games will join the now more expensive subscription service over the course of October, with three titles set to exit the service; as the cycle is always that with new games entering, old games leave. Some of the highlights for games entering this month include Ninja Gaiden 4, the first new entry in the Ninja Gaiden series in years, which is also launching into the service for those subscribed to the top Ultimate tier of Game Pass.</p>



<p>Ball x Pit is another of the 12 games that is launching into the service on day one, with Double Fine Productions' new game, Keeper, rounding out the three games launching into Xbox Game Pass this month.</p>



<p>Other titles not launching day one into the service, but still notable, include the return of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Evil West, Pax Dei, Eternal Strands, and a preview for RPG auto-battler, He Is Coming.</p>



<p>Here's a list of all the games arriving in Game Pass this month, the dates they'll come, where they're playable, and which tiers they'll be available for, since each tier now only gets access to a certain number of games. </p>



<ul>
<li>Supermarket Simulator - October 8 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers </li>



<li>Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Editions - October 9 - PC - All tiers</li>



<li>The Casting of Frank Stone - October 14 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Ball x Pit - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Eternal Strands - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>He Is Coming (Game Preview) - October 15 - PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>Pax Dei - October 16 - PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Keeper - October 17 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Evil West - October 21 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden 4 - October 21 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the game's leaving the service this month, as of October 15, Game Pass subscribers can say goodbye to Coccon, Core Keeper, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Day 2025 Broadcast Announced for October 23]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-day-2025-broadcast-announced-october-23/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-day-2025-broadcast-announced-for-october-23.1319962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios announced that the Fallout Day 2025 broadcast would be streamed live on October 23, 2025, at 1 PM Eastern Time via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>, and Steam. Bethesda said fans can tune in to learn new information and announcements about 'existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events'. October 23 is no random date: it's when the two-hour-long nuclear exchange between the United States and China led to the post-nuclear setting of Fallout.</p>



<p>When Bethesda mentions existing games, the mind immediately goes to Fallout 76, since it's the only franchise game that gets regular updates. However, Fallout 76 just got a major reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the deep dive of the Burning Springs update</a>. In December, Bethesda Game Studios will release a major land expansion, bringing Fallout players to Ohio for the first time in the franchise. The new region draws heavily on Fallout 3 and New Vegas aesthetics, aiming to recapture the feel of a harsh, depraved wasteland seen in those games. </p>



<p>Then there's the introduction of The Ghoul, the character played by Walton Goggins in the TV show, who is coming to the game and will introduce the bounty hunting feature with tiered contracts (grunt and head hunts). Bethesda hopes this will create ongoing, repeatable content that encourages both solo and cooperative play. The randomization of contract locations and the public event nature of head hunts foster community interaction and provide a robust source of rewards, addressing players’ desires for challenging but rewarding activities. </p>



<p>There might be some additional tidbits about the Burning Springs update to be shared in the upcoming Fallout Day broadcast, but by and large, the reveal for Fallout 76 already happened. As such, franchise fans are already hoping to hear something about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-3-oblivion-remasters-xbox-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster</a>, as that might fall under 'existing Fallout games'. Of course, it's always possible that Bethesda has just found a new platform to launch Fallout 4 on, like the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has been significantly improved on Nintendo Switch 2 by a new patch that went live this week.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64">a new report shared on X by SuperMetalDave64</a>, the 1.4 update introduces significant visual improvements, including improved texture quality, LOD draw distance, and lighting and fog with less light bleed. Even at a glance, these visual improvements are easily spottable and bring the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game closer to the other console versions of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The newest update 1.4 to Cronos: The New Dawn on Switch 2 is the biggest yet for graphical improvements:</p><p>-Textures Noticeably Improved<br>-LOD Draw Distance Improved<br>-Lighting/Fog Improved (less light bleed)<br>-Item Pick Up Highlight Effect Fixed <br>-Time Reversal Effect Fixed <a href="https://t.co/yxBq2SSrEG">pic.twitter.com/yxBq2SSrEG</a></p></div>— SuperMetalDave64 (@SMetaldave64) <a href="https://twitter.com/SMetaldave64/status/1975335969537860057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>SuperMetalDave64 also shared a quick comparison between the 1.3 version, the new 1.4 version and the max settings PC version of Cronos: The New Dawn. This side-by-side comparison clearly highlights the improvements which make the Switch 2 version a more palatable choice than at launch.</p>

These along with LOD textures/objects were fixed to look more like the PC version: <a href="https://t.co/w9UHQwMkbg">pic.twitter.com/w9UHQwMkbg</a></p></div>— SuperMetalDave64 (@SMetaldave64) <a href="https://twitter.com/SMetaldave64/status/1975428139485700335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn leverages a lot on its visuals to create the haunting experience that defines the game, so the improvements introduced in the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game effectively improve the whole game on the system. You can learn more about how the game's atmosphere makes for one of Bloober Team's best games by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">my review</a>.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
