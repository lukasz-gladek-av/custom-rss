			<p>Arrowhead Games has announced that the previously PlayStation-console exclusive, Helldivers 2, is finally making its way across the aisle to team green, and will launch on Xbox Series X/S later this summer on <strong>August 26, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by Arrowhead's chief creative officer, Johan Pilestedt, during a short livestream where Arrowhead revealed the trailer for Helldivers 2 coming to Xbox, followed by Pilestedt briefly speaking about how players have been requesting backup since Helldivers 2 launched, and the best way for Arrowhead to accommodate those requests in the fight for democracy, was to add a new platform to the mix. </p>



<p>Pre-orders for Helldivers 2 on Xbox are already live for those who want to make sure they can join the fight right when the game goes live on August 26. Helldivers 2 will also not be launching on Xbox Series consoles directly into Xbox Game Pass. </p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, game director on Helldivers 2, Mikael Eriksson added "<em>We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years - and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.</em>"</p>



<p>Despite the fact that players have been asking for Helldivers 2 to come to Xbox since the game first released on PlayStation and PC, it wouldn't have been the biggest shock if it never happened, considering the fact that PlayStation did publish the game. Arrowhead isn't a PlayStation first-party studio, but as the game's publisher, it still held strong sway over where the game ended up. Fortunately for Xbox players, a deal was reached, and now those with naught but a Series X/S at home can join the fight for Super Earth. </p>



<p>And just in time too, since Xbox players need something to take their minds off the week that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">Xbox and Microsoft have had</a>. Yesterday, news of mass layoffs at Microsoft started to trickle out, with more than 9,000 people laid off across all of Microsoft, a not insignificant amount of those coming from the Gaming division. Multiple projects were cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, the latter of which saw the studio shut down. <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG was canned</a>, along with several other unannounced projects. <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">Romero Studios had the funding for their game cut</a>, and there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">still more details coming</a> regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">just how many people are losing their jobs</a>. And the week isn't even over yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Romero Games, the studio founded ten years ago by DOOM series creator John Romero and his weife Brenda, confirmed its next unannounced project is no longer in the works, and the project's cancellation is related to the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">wave of Xbox layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>In a new message shared on <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">X</a>, the studio confirmed that their unnamed publisher has canceled funding for their game alongside several other unannounced projects at other studios. This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher and above the studio's visibility and control. The decision to cancel the project, the message continues, does not in any way reflect the team's work, performance, or quality of the project. Development was reportedly proceeding well, but this wasn't enough to avoid the project from being canned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Romero Games' message doesn't mention the publisher's name, a message shared on X by the studio's former hard surface artist, Christoph Redl, confirms that the project's cancellation is a consequence of the recent wave of Xbox layoffs.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I’ve lost my position at Romero Games.</p><p>I’m now actively looking for new opportunities as a Prop Artist, Hard Surface Artist, or 3D Artist.<br>I'm open to both in-house and remote roles and excited to bring my skills to a new team. <a href="https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b">https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b</a></p></div>— Christoph Redl (@christophredl94) <a href="https://twitter.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the message above, Romero Games' new project is not the only one that has been canceled as a result of this week's Xbox layoffs, and a lot of studios have been impacted, from Forza Motorsport series developer<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/"> Turn 10</a>, which was hit hard with over 70 employees having been laid off, to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Zenimax Online</a>, whose new MMORPG has been canceled, and Perfect Dark's developer The Initiative, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">shut down</a> following the cancellation of its highly anticipated project.</p>

			<p>Proper usage of the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler can make the Nintendo Switch 2 punch well above its weight in terms of image quality and even surpass the Xbox Series S, as highlighted by the excellent work CAPCOM has done with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> port.</p>



<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series which debuted on PC and consoles two years back, highlighting how NVIDIA DLSS does a great job upscaling the image to 1080p in docked mode from the low base resolution of 540p. Though there are some issues like visible aliasing and flicker when characters reveal the background, the end results are considered better in terms of sharpness and image stability than those produced by CAPCOM's in-house upscaler used in the Xbox Series S version, which renders at native 1080 but doesn't handle image noise well. The Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game also beats the Xbox Series S release in terms of texture quality, despite the minor 1 GB differences in available RAM in favor of the Nintendo system. In other cases, however, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is closer to the PlayStation 4 release with no screen space reflections in Fighting Ground matches, missing depth of field, background NPC counts restricted to the standard setting, and non-interactive physics-based particles. In handheld mode, with a lower 360p base resolution upscaled to 720p and additional graphics cutbacks to keep the 60 FPS target, the game is even closer to the PlayStation 4 version, which is still rather impressive, for a handheld.</p>

<p>Though obviously more powerful than its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving with some of its launch titles and upgrades to original Switch games what it is capable of achieving. The Splatoon 3 upgrade is particularly impressive, as it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">increases resolution by five to six times</a> in certain scenarios while keeping the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, making playing the third entry in the series on the system the way to go to enjoy it at its very best.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
