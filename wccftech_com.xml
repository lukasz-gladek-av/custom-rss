			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launched on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC three weeks ago, and according to data from Circana, it has been the best-selling game in the US each of those weeks.</p>
<p>Executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana Mat Piscatella took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24">BlueSky</a> on Monday and announced that Shadows has stayed in the top spot for weekly game sales in the United States since it launched on March 20, 2025.</p>
<p>Piscatella also confirmed that Assassin's Creed Shadows is now the second-best-selling game in the United States for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's smash success to start the year, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>"<em>Here's a fun one...Assassin's Creed: Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market, according to Circana's Retail Tracking Service (dollar sales, latest data through April 5th)</em>," Piscatella wrote on BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em>Currently ranks #2 year-to-date trailing only Monster Hunter: Wilds</em>."</p>
<p>Just two days after launching, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed Shadows had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/">surpassed 2 million players worldwide</a>&nbsp;after it broke <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/">one million copies sold</a> on launch day. A week after it launched, Ubisoft confirmed it had gone even further and blown past <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/">3 million players</a>.</p>
<p>These milestones and financial achievements are enormous wins for Ubisoft, a company that desperately needed a win after 2024 was filled with major financial misses. Both of Ubisoft's big-budget games for 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>,&nbsp;missed the mark in several ways, including commercially, which made the cloud above the company only grow darker&nbsp;as more and more pressure weighed on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows success.</p>
<p>Ubisoft recently underwent a significant structural change, with its biggest series, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, all being moved to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/"> a new subsidiary</a> in which Tencent is a minority partner.</p>
<p>Plans for this new subsidiary are still unclear, with a<a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/"> recently leaked internal memo</a> including hints that layoffs could still very well be coming as the company adjusts to its new structure. We can only hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows's major success helps alleviate some of the losses, should they still occur.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bit-reactors-tactical-star-wars-game-star-wars-zero-company-will-be-revealed-this-saturday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This coming Saturday, April 19, 2025, EA and Bit Reactor will reveal the previously announced single-player Star Wars turn-based tactics game, which we now know is officially titled Star Wars Zero Company.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company was one of EA's last few remaining Star Wars games after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/">unannounced shooter from Respawn</a> was canceled earlier this year. We're also still waiting for news on the third installment in Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series, though that seems to be further off considering Star Wars Jedi: Survivor only released two years ago now.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company will be showcased during the Star Wars Celebration this weekend. The celebration officially kicks off on Friday, April 18, and runs until Sunday, April 20. Zero Company will be unveiled during a <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/en-us/explore-the-event/panels.html#/event/bit-reactor-developer-panel-featuring-respawn-entertainment-and-lucasfilm-games">one-hour panel</a> with EA, Respawn,&nbsp;and Bit Reactor that will kick off at <strong>1:30 pm PT /4:30 pm ET/9:30 pm BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of a turn-based tactics game set in the Star Wars universe has had many speculating that this will be a Star Wars-skinned take on XCOM, though this coming Saturday's reveal will be the first time we see if that's the case or not.</p>
<p>At the very least, Star Wars Zero Company will be a different kind of Star Wars game than we've been getting in recent years. Star Wars Outlaws might not have featured any Jedi, but it was still a third-person action-adventure game, like Respawn's Jedi series. As far as other different or new Star Wars games are concerned, we're still waiting to hear about Star Wars Eclipse, which seems to be delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/">beyond 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, if that even is still in production.</p>
