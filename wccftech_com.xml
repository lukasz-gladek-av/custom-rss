			<p>Nacon has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/538859942242681786?l=english">announced</a> the Year 2 roadmap for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, detailing the highlights that will be a part of each season, including this week's Season 4, all the way up to Season 8, which will debut in July 2026. </p>



<p>KT Racing and Nacon put together an hour-long developer update that digs into what's to come, along with a short retrospective on how things have gone since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> launched last September.</p>

<p>Starting with what's to come in the short term, Season 4 is launching this coming Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and with it five new cars, new content like Casino, a new currency for players to earn called Diamonds, and other enhancements to the game. </p>



<p>There's also a key community feature that's live from now until August 4, 2025, which is that players will be able to vote on which new mission type will be added to Solar Crown. Detective, Delivery, Photography, and Adrenaline are the four types players can choose from, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">you can submit your vote until August 4th at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Season 5 will arrive in October of this year, which is also when Year 2 will officially kick off. That's when taxi missions will be making their return, and when a new online store will be introduced. There will also be re-balances to the in-game economy, new vehicles, and a bevy of performance and graphical boosts that'll be directly from the KT Engine getting its own upgrade. </p>



<p>Season 6 kicks off January 2026, and it's also when the mission players voted for will be added to the game, among the other usual features like new cars and improvements to the game.</p>



<p>Season 7 arrives in April 2026, bringing along with it the introduction of Official Racing Centers, dedicated racing venues for Hong Kong Island and Ibiza City, and a revamping of live events and the premium Solar Pass. Finally, Season 8 arrives as previously mentioned in July 2026, which will be highlighted by the return of Housing and Real Estate, two elements missing from Solar Crown that players loved in the first two Test Drive Unlimited games. It'll also add Extreme missions and Passenger mode, along with the rest of the usual suspects. </p>



<p>Beyond Season 8, Nacon and KT Racing are committed to continuing to update and improve Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, as the team is already considering adding elements like bikes and yachts.</p>

			<p>Rematch has surpassed 5 million unique players across all platforms, developer Sloclap announced. It's a strong milestone for the game, just one month after launch, even with it missing key features like crossplay support, which it will continue to miss for another 6-9 weeks, according to Sloclap.</p>



<p>Sloclap announced the milestone with a <a href="https://x.com/sloclap/status/1947325700681159130">post on its official account on X</a>, where it thanked players for the support and reiterated its commitment to "<em>make Rematch better</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like any live game, that process is going to take time, but it's perhaps taking longer than players would have expected, with crossplay support being the hot-button topic, due in part to how Sloclap handled the lack of crossplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Hours before it was set to launch</a>, Sloclap let players know that Rematch would be launching without crossplay. Sloclap had tried to prepare it for launch but decided far too late to let players know that it wasn't going to happen. Later, Sloclap apologized for the error, as Rematch also launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">bevy of bugs and matchmaking issues</a> that it was focused on fixing, but made sure to emphasize that crossplay functionality was at the top of its priority list.</p>



<p>In the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">latest developer update</a>, Sloclap went over a number of features it is working on based on player feedback, while also apologizing for the problems some players continue to face, even as the game is in a much better state than it was a month ago.</p>



<p>In the short-term future, Rematch is getting a patch sometime this week that will enable players to remap controls while playing with a controller, add colorblindness options as an accessibility update, and fix a number of bugs. There's also netcode fixes to come, though there's no exact timeline as to when all these updates will arrive. Best to keep an eye on the game's social accounts if you want to know exactly when everything goes live.</p>



<p>New ranked queues, improvements to keyboard and mouse controls, the ability to report toxic players, regional server fixes, and overall upgrades to matchmaking and its ranking system are also all under review from Sloclap as it continues to work on Rematch. It doesn't seem like there's a specific timeline for any of this, but some of the issues players are reporting, such as complaints about the structure of the current ranking system, take time and experimentation to be fixed, and even then, it still won't please everyone.</p>



<p>Needless to say, while it's great for Sloclap that Rematch has had such a strong launch month, with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">1 million copies sold</a> and now more than 5 million players having checked out the game with more than 60 million hours played across the globe, that will all be for nothing if it can't stay on top of its issues. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, it was clear to me that the gameplay was very tight and highly polished, something that didn't really come as a huge surprise from the team that made such a solid melee fighter in Sifu. But its technical issues and structural issues beyond what happens on the pitch are what bring it down. I've still been playing a game of Rematch every day or so, but it would be nice to have a gameplay session where I don't lose a game because my tackle didn't register and the opposing team was able to score. Or one where we didn't have to scramble to protect our net because suddenly the keeper couldn't pick up the ball.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll start to see these fixes come in soon, and for the sake of the player base and matchmaking, crossplay will arrive closer to that six-week mark than nine weeks. </p>
