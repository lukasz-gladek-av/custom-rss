			<p>Nintendo will live stream its Mario Kart World Direct tomorrow morning, <strong>April 17, 2025</strong>, at <strong>6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The direct was announced when Nintendo first showcased Mario Kart World during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> at the beginning of the month as the next chance we'd get to learn more about it. With the live stream placeholder now up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, we know that it will only be a 15-minute presentation in which Nintendo says we'll get an "<em>in-depth</em>" look at the new kart racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo shows in this direct, but, of course, we've seen a lot about Mario Kart World since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this month. A big part of the conversation has been around the fact that Mario Kart World is one of the few Nintendo Switch 2 games that will cost $80.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World is worth the increased price.</a> Bowser even highlighted tomorrow's direct, telling players with doubts to tune in and see what Nintendo shows off.</p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to</em> <em>discover</em>." Bowser told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fmario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fswitch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=a8794423f20c06ce869d8877c3daa0d3&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">IGN</a>. "<em>And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.</em>"</p>
<p>Wccftech's own Nathan Birch had the chance to play Mario Kart World during a recent Nintendo event, and while he admits to having fun with the game, it also didn't blow him away. That said, there's still a lot of potential that can't be seen in a short 20-minute demo. We'll see how much tomorrow's 15-minute direct adds to that.</p>
<p>"<em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times."</em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Birch wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em>"</p>

			<p>Today marks the official launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-has-finally-been-launched-heres-where-you-can-get-it-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics card</a> (available in 8 and 16GB models), and NVIDIA has also released the related Game Ready driver (version 576.02).</p>
<p>The driver is also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-squad-no-more-room-in-hell-2-and-exfil-now-support-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new slate of NVIDIA DLSS 4 games</a>, chiefly Black Myth: Wukong. The highly successful game created by Game Science runs at nearly 250 frames per second on an RTX 5090 GPU with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (output at 4K resolution) and full ray tracing enabled. The RTX 5080 stops at an average of 160 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti at 138 FPS, and the RTX 5070 at 112 FPS.</p>
<p>This new Game Ready driver also adds support for 19 new G-SYNC Compatible displays and 6 new Optimal Playable Settings profiles for Deadlock, Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced, Half-Life 2 with RTX, inZOI, Monster Hunter Wilds, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>

			<p>The stunning NVIDIA Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo shown last month is now available for download, giving users the chance to experience neural rendering, which NVIDIA itself described as the future of graphics.</p>
<p>The new demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/zorah/ZorahSample_UE5_Source_1.0.0.7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is powered by the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch and features plenty of cutting-edge tech, so performance is likely to be unstable on the vast majority of system configurations. Still, it provides an early look at how next-generation games will look with enhanced real-time path tracing and every other improvement offered by Neural Rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX Neural Rendering support in DirectX was announced last month during<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/"> GDC 2025</a>, when NVIDIA also provided an overview of how Neural Rendering can be used, such as RTX Neural Texture Compression, which can create a neural representation of thousands of textures in a very short time, saving up to seven times the VRAM and RAM compared to regular compression tech, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache, which can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting from just one or two bounces to optimize performance and visuals.</p>
<p>More information on the RTX Neural Rendering features found in the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo can be found on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>
