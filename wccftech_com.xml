			<p>During Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, publishers Paradox Interactive and White Wolf and developer The Chinese Room announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The news will certainly come as a relief to long-time fans, after all the issues with Hardsuit Labs and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switch to The Chinese Room</a>.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open, with customers able to choose from three editions: the basic one, the Deluxe One, and the Premium one. The latter is particularly interesting because it includes access to two clans for the main character, Lasombra and Toreador, who are otherwise locked during character creation. This decision may well prove controversial among fans.</p>



<p>Here's the full lowdown:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Deluxe Edition includes Santa Monica Memories, a cosmetic pack featuring decor items inspired by the original cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines to adorn Phyre’s in-game apartment. Santa Monica Memories can also be purchased separately for $11.99 USD.</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Premium Edition includes both the Santa Monica Memories and Shadows and Silk DLC. The latter, as mentioned above, enables players to choose the Lasombra or Toreador clans for Phyre. Each clan offers unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits. Shadows and Silk can also be purchased separately for $21.99 USD.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those who pre-order any Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 edition will receive the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox, an in-game decor item featuring original music by iconic Bloodlines 1 composer Rik Schaffer.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/silent-hill-f-everything-we-know-brand-new-chapter-konami-horror/">Silent Hill f</a> was another one of the games we knew we'd get a new look at during <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and just like every showing of the game so far, Silent Hill f continues to look more terrifying than the last time we saw it.</p>



<p>The new trailer shows off more of the gameplay and combat that players will experience when the game launches this coming September, and delves more into the horrifying story and mystery that players will navigate in Silent Hill f.</p>

<p>Silent Hill f puts you in the shoes of Hinako Shimizu, who has to figure out what happened to her town when a thick fog covers every inch of it, and monsters begin to roam the streets. It's both the most exciting and mysterious of the Silent Hill games Konami has lined up in its portfolio. </p>



<p>There's a lot we've heard about how this new adventure in the Silent Hill series came together, about how it's core design concept is to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-silent-hill-f-deep-dive-digs-into-how-konamis-core-design-concept-of-find-the-beauty-in-terror-drove-the-games-development/">"<em>find the beauty in horror</em>"</a> and why the team wanted to bring the series out of the United States and into Japan, but there's still plenty that's unclear about Hinako Shimizu's story, and what exactly is plaguing her and her town.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we don't have to wait too much longer to find out, as the game is due to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this coming September 25, 2025. For more Silent Hill after this game's release next month, fans of the series have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake of the original game from Bloober Team to look forward to</a>.</p>
