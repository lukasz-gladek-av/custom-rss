			<p>EA studio Codemasters had two major announcements for players, one to do with the WRC and DiRT games, and the other with <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/">F1 25</a>.</p>
<p>F1 25 fans get the 'good news' end of the deal, with Codemasters showing off the first gameplay for F1 25, highlighting the reversed tracks, the improvements players will enjoy in F1 25 due to <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">LIDAR scanning</span>, and all the little details in these tracks being rebuilt to really add that extra layer of realism for players keen to jump behind the wheel.</p>
<p>WRC and DiRT fans aren't as lucky, with the confirmation that the 2024 season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2023 is the last expansion from the team, and Codemasters is officially pausing development on future rally racing titles.</p>
<p>"<em>After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion. For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players,</em>" Codemasters wrote in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">blog post</a> on the EA Sports WRC website.</p>
<p>"<em>Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge...Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.</em>"</p>
<p>Back to F1 25, the new gameplay trailer showcases four of the five updated circuits and digs into the improvements made in this iteration.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The tech behind LIDAR gives players unprecedented levels of detail, bringing them closer to each race weekend,</span></em>" creative director at Codemasters Gavin Cooper said in a press release. "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Also, weâ€™ve carefully selected the three reverse circuits to provide a unique and engaging experience for our players that feels polished, authentic, and fun. The process includes reworking DRS zones, retraining AI, recalibrating sector boundaries, repositioning the starting grid and pit lanes, and more, delivering new thrills and</span></em> <em>challenges</em>."</p>
