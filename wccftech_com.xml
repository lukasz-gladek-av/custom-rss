			<p>Bethesda's new update for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/6KFC705KG7qmVTfEfG7Txl/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-steam-beta-update-1-1">update 1.1</a>, is now available on all platforms, after initially being available only for Steam Beta users when it launched on June 5.</p>
<p>The update addresses several issues, from bugs that were causing the game to crash or freeze at different points, to VFX and gameplay animation issues. Notably, it also fixes a number of quest issues that would have soft-locked players from being able to complete the quests and progress further.</p>
<p>This is the first of two major patches that Bethesda is working on for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the second of which will also be out first through Steam Beta, before being made available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. There's currently no word from Bethesda as to when the next update will arrive, with the studio simply saying in the patch notes that it will be live "<em>in the coming weeks</em>."</p>
<p>While Oblivion Remastered launched with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">significant performance issues</a>, that hasn't stopped it from being a top seller since it launched. It was part of Xbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">US game sales dominance in April 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">according to Newzoo, Oblivion IV Remastered is</a> "<em>a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively</em>."</p>
<p>Though, if you disagree with Newzoo, and Bethesda isn't fixing the issues you're having with Oblivion Remastered fast enough, plenty of modders are already putting in the work to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-anti-stutter-improvement/">fix the game's problems themselves, with varying degrees of success.</a></p>
<p>Barring performance issues, returning to Oblivion has been a treat for many fans of The Elder Scrolls series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo scored the remaster very highly</a> when it was shadow-dropped earlier this year, and praised Bethesda for bringing the game into the modern gaming landscape in all the best ways.</p>
<p>"<em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda's classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>5 million copies sold</strong>, Capcom announced in a <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">post on the game's official X account</a>.</p>
<p>The milestone comes two years after the latest entry into Capcom's long-running fighting series launched. It's almost two years to the date since Street Fighter 6 launched on June 2, 2023.</p>
<p>"<em>Street Fighter 6 has now sold over 5 million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!</em>" Capcom wrote announcing the news.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is the latest event in Capcom's continued stellar performance in recent years, and it's also less than a year since Street Fighter 6 reached its last major sales milestone of <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/">4 million units sold.</a></p>
<p>Hitting 5 million in just two years also puts SF6 perfectly in position to be the best-selling game in the entire Street Fighter series. The current top spot is held by Street Fighter 5, which is sitting at over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-street-fighter-v-i-sold-7-million-copies-in-7-years">7 million copies</a> sold since it launched in 2016. It could be the case that Capcom is celebrating SF6's three year anniversary with the news that it's also now the best-selling game in the entire franchise.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">announced</a> the Year 3 roster of fighters that'll be joining Street Fighter 6 between this summer and spring 2026. At some point this summer, Sagat will join the roster, followed by C. Viper joining in fall 2025, then Alex joining in early spring 2026, and Ingrid shortly after in late spring 2026.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-fbc-firebreak-battlefield-2042-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-and-more/">announced</a> the nine games that are being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for June 2025, with the two biggest titles being Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, the latter of which is launching into the service on June 17, 2025.</p>
<p>Along with Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, other notable titles PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can play beginning on June 17, 2025, include Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2, and We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. PS Plus Premium subscribers will also be able to dive back into the world of Deus Ex, with Deus Ex: The Conspiracy being the lone addition to the PS Plus Premium Classic's Catalog for June 2025.</p>
<p>Here's the full list for all nine games that'll be available to subscribers on June 17:</p>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wilds (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak are arguably the two major games added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs this month, having Battlefield in this month's batch of games won't feel like much of anything for subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-march-2023-battlefield-2042-extra-premium-uncharted-ghostwire/">In March 2023,</a> Battlefield 2042 was the headlining game for the PS Plus Essential's tier three monthly games. Anyone who is subscribed to PS Plus at all, without needing to go to the higher tiers, likely already has Battlefield 2042 in their library of games they got through PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>This also makes for two straight months of Battlefield games being added to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalog, because<a href="https://wccftech.com/sandland-battlefield-v-and-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-included-in-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-may-2025/"> May 2025's additions included Battlefield V</a>. Another game which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-may-2021-games-godfall-disco-elysium-battlefield-v/">previously been one of the three free games offered for Essential tier subscribers</a>, even before PlayStation officially switched to its new tiered PlayStation Plus structure.</p>
<p>At least FBC: Firebreak is an entirely new addition for subscribers to enjoy this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">Remedy also just detailed</a> what Firebreak players will be getting in two major free updates coming to the game post-launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25.1215768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes revealed that the next large Warframe update called Isleweaver will be released on all platforms on June 25.</p>
<p>Players who have completed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> quest 'The Hex' will have access to an expanded Kingdom of Duviri. They will face Major Rusalka once again in the emotionally turbulent Kingdom of Duviri, alongside new threats to this region such as The Murmur and the looming presence of The Indifference. Activities include collecting lore fragments to reveal narrative secrets, discovering the new island of Scholar’s Landing and unraveling the mystery behind Rusalka’s reign, before facing off against the latest Warframe, Oraxia, in a new mini-boss battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isleweaver introduces Operation: Eight Claw. Here, players partner with Dominus Thrax to earn exclusive event rewards by reclaiming Scholar’s Landing and Duviri’s throne from Major Rusalka and the Murmur in a new Clan Operation. Search the area for lore fragments to learn more about Rusalka's story and the current state of Duviri's kingdom. During Operation: Eight Claw, previous Clan Operation rewards will be available to earn again until Wednesday, 16 July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Isleweaver Official Teaser - Coming in June!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBsQROfuf0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All players will have access to Oraxia, the 61st Warframe, known as the mistress of fear. Oraxia can isolate and execute weakened foes, poison enemies, imbibe marked enemies for buffs and summon spiderling swarms like a good broodmother would from the corpses of the fallen. Two new weapons will be added to the Warframe arsenal alongside Oraxia: the Scyotid barb cluster throwing weapon and the Spinnerex poison whip.</p>
<p>There are also new Deluxe Cosmetics and TennoGen. Explore new facets of Citrine with the latest Deluxe Collection, including the Citrine Aphrodita Skin, the Corazon Syandana and other bejewelled cosmetics, all of which have been given a new look. Players can also take their Fashion Frame game to the next level and collect new TennoGen cosmetics to adorn their Warframes, weapons and operators with new, community-designed customisations when Isleweaver launches.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also reiterated its commitment to refining Warframe's first impressions for new players this year with the launch of Isleweaver. A revamped onboarding tutorial has been introduced in one of the first quests, Vor's Prize, which modernizes the boss fight. Players may also experiment with a rework of Valkyr’s gameplay, which changes her ability kit to allow for a faster, more aggressive playstyle that caters to her melee-focused kit.</p>
<p>More announcements will be made during <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TennoCon</a>, which will take place on July 18-19 in London, Ontario, Canada. It should be a special event, given that it's the tenth year of the fan-focused Warframe convention.</p>
