			<p>The Bloodborne PC Remaster project received a new update this week, further refining the visual overhaul project with new fixes and improvements.</p>



<p>The 0.89.6 version of the project introduces fixes for objects being in the wrong color or having the wrong lighting, makes some additions to parallax and fixes some remaining bugs found in previous versions. The new version of the project was released alongside a new Reshade Preset, which includes a different type of temporal anti-aliasing that the project creator, fromsoftserve, finds works better in the game. Both the new version of the project and the Reshade preset can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">downloaded from Nexus mods</a>.</p>



<p>Together with the launch of the new version of the Bloodborne PC Remaster Project, developer fromsoftserve shared a new video detailing the improvements introduced by the mod, which can be found below. The most notable of them continue to be dynamic shadows, which required the removal of the game's baked lighting and quite a lot of work to get right. The modder's hard work was completely worth it, as the game looks closer to later games developed by FromSoftware with this crucial change.</p>

<p>As the beloved PS4 exclusive developed by FromSoftware has never received an official PC port, the Bloodborne PC Remaster mod is only compatible with the emulated version of the game played via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">ShadPS4 emulator</a>. You can learn more about the emulator that made the wish of many come true on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

			<p>Big changes are rumored to be on the horizon for Xbox Game Pass, including changes to PC Game Pass, a price increase for the Ultimate subscription and cheaper, ad-supported tiers.</p>



<p>The rumors originated on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-big-changes-to-gamepass-including-a-free-cheaper-tier-with-ads.1313263/">ResetERA forums</a> from moderator Slayven, who claimed to have information from an unspecified source that has proved reliable in the past. The timing for all these changes is unclear, although some are reportedly coming next year.</p>



<p>The first big change will be the sunsetting of PC Game Pass, presumably leaving the Ultimate tier as the only way to access the Game Pass library on PC. The price of the Ultimate tier is reportedly increasing to $25 in the United States, although the timing is uncertain, as this price increase could be delayed to 2026.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard subscription tiers are reportedly not getting any major change. The two subscription tiers are rumored to be renamed to Game Pass Essential and Game Pass Premium, mirroring the naming for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus subscription tiers</a>, which sounds like a good marketing move.</p>



<p>The biggest change to Xbox Game Pass, reportedly coming in 2026, however, is the addition of an ad-supported subscription tier. This tier, which could also be offered for free, will be time-based with forced ads.</p>



<p>As there's no way to verify the information revealed in today's report, we have to take these Xbox Game Pass changes with a massive grain of salt. Considering how the gaming market continues to change, however, and how Microsoft has been making changes to the service in recent times, there's a solid chance that something may indeed be brewing as today's rumors suggest.</p>



<p>Discussion regarding Xbox Game Pass has always been heated since the service's launch in 2017, as if these changes are indeed coming, it will only get more heated. Although Microsoft has never disclosed the performance of the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">it reportedly seems to have been doing well</a>. As such, it's no surprise the company will continue to focus on it for the foreseeable future, as head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, confirmed not only that the service is popular among partners, but also that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">2025 has marked the company's largest investment in Game Pass to date.</a></p>



<p>More information on Xbox Game Pass, its subscription tiers and the current game library can be found on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games">service's official website.</a></p>
