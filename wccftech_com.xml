			<p>As regular readers of gaming news know all too well, <strong>Wedbush Securities</strong> Strategic Advisor <strong>Michael Pachter</strong> is not one to mince words, always speaking his mind regardless. In 2018, he famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/pachter-loot-boxes-consumers-are-stupid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>loot boxes only existed because consumers were stupid</strong>. In 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized Sony</a> for <strong>vastly overpaying Bungie in the $3.6 billion acquisition</strong>, especially compared to <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> and <strong>Take-Two</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Zynga</strong>. </p>



<p>In the same year, he also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prophesied</a> that <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> active subscribers <strong>would blow up to 100 million when Activision Blizzard games were added,</strong> and literally doubled down on the prediction in 2024, when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>Game Pass could reach 200 million active subscribers in 10 years</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/the-internet-reacts-to-departure-of-phil-spencer-and-sarah-bond-from-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a brief conversation with GamesBeat</a> (available only to GB Max users) following the leadership change at <strong>Microsoft</strong>, Pachter has now completely modified his stance. To begin with, <strong>he wasn't positive at all about the next Xbox console</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is currently targeting a tentative 2027 launch</a>), and that's precisely because of Game Pass.</p>



<p><em>I think the console is dead. I think they’ve already blown it with the console by embracing Game Pass.</em></p>



<p>Wasn't Pachter pro-Game Pass? He was, but he appears to have changed his mind following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Game Pass restructuring</a> (and price increase), <strong>which he strongly believes is the wrong model</strong>.</p>



<p><em>The problem with Game Pass was it was all or nothing. Give me 30 bucks a month or f*** you. You aren’t playing my games. Why wouldn’t you sell EA Sports FC to the 100 million people who would like to play it but don’t want to buy a console? Of course you should. I think that’s the ultimate solution, leveraging Microsoft’s game library, live ops understanding and cloud infrastructure to be like Steam, but for connectivity.</em></p>



<p><em>If they ever did that, I think it would work. I think the all-in on $30 a month subscription was the wrong way to go. The price should be $10 a month, all you can eat. Who’s going to pay for a buffet knowing it’s five times the cost of a meal? How can you make a business charging people $360 a year up front when a game costs only $70? They should have run it like a cafeteria. That’s their mistake.</em></p>



<p>He does have a point: <strong>Microsoft likely cannot have its cake and eat it, too</strong>. By pushing so heavily on Game Pass and the multiplatform strategy, <strong>they have decreased the value of owning an Xbox console</strong>, as shown by the console's hardware sales over the last three or four years. But now, with the Game Pass price increase, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they've also lost many subscribers</a> who believe paying that much for the service isn't really worth it anymore</strong>. </p>



<p>According to recent rumors, Microsoft <strong>might be looking to add more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party</a> and/or <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-adding-wow-subscription-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-party</a> services to make Game Pass Ultimate a more attractive proposition at $30</strong>, but it might already be too late to turn the ship. </p>
