			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/electronic-arts/">EA</a> has announced the release dates for both Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports College Football 26, and confirmed that there will be no Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of both games, leaving behind the last-gen versions five years after the launch of the current generation.</p>
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 will launch on&nbsp;<strong>July 10, 2025</strong> and will be available three days earlier for players who purchase early access through the Deluxe Edition, while Madden NFL 26 will arrive on <strong>August 14, 2025,</strong> and will also be available three days earlier for those who grab the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>If you were already planning on grabbing both games, EA has a<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/bundles/mvp-bundle/buy"> bundle</a> you can grab that'll get you both games when they release.</p>

<p>The Deluxe Edition for Madden NFL 26 nabs you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 Madden Points</li>
<li>Season 1 Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Cover Athlete Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Superstar Legendary XP Boost</li>
<li>Franchise Coach ability points</li>
<li>Player card exclusive item</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition for EA Sports College Football 26 gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 College Football Points</li>
<li>Top Prospect Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>All Hands Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>Dynasty Coach Points</li>
<li>Road to Glory Skill Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVP Bundle, which is what you'll want to get if you were getting both games anyway, gets you all of the above along with a few bundle exclusive items for either game. If you pre-order the bundle ahead of April 29, 2025, you'll always get the Travis Hunter 99 OVR player item in both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> was a smash-success for EA last year, with the series returning after being on hiatus for a decade. It'll be interesting to see if that same success can be repeated, or even surpassed this year. Sports games are a consistent seller every year, and it's doubtful that the same fans who flooded to buy the first official college football video game in 10 years are satiated by just one new release.</p>
