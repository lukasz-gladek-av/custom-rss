			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-legend-of-the-nomad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resumed</a> publishing developer diaries for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The new entry is solely dedicated to the protagonist, the enigmatic <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-protagonist-phyre-unveiled-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elder vampire Phyre</a>, and their so-called Nomad's legacy. According to the narrative's background, Phyre is really old and left a big mark on history, creating all sorts of legends that various characters in Seattle will have heard of.&nbsp;During multiple conversations, players will have the opportunity to shape their character's legacy, as outlined by Senior Narrative Designer and Writer Sarah Longthorne:</p>
<p><em>Importantly, we have chosen not to do this up-front in the style of Bloodlines 1, because this history is a choice as much as any other in the game, and a choice is most effective once you know the stakes. It should make you umm and ahh, maybe even agonise a little: What will happen to X if I choose Y? As such, it was important to us to have these choices occur once play has already begun, once you have started to feel your way around Seattle and its various dangers. These will come in waves — some ‘golden path’, others optional (for instance, if you choose to spend more time with and open up to certain characters) — each tackling a different aspect of your legacy which, tapestried together, suggest a more bespoke story.</em></p>
<p><em>The first thing we establish is the theme. Who does the Nomad say they are? A legendary warrior? A curious traveler? Or a desperate survivor, fleeing disaster to disaster to avoid their foes? Once this is chosen, we branch out into further options — each unique to that choice — which both refine roleplay and drill further into that initial theme with your motivation. These sub-choices layer in more texture, allowing your mind to play it all out like a movie and start filling in the details. Later, you’ll have other opportunities to further fill out this narrative, even (if you wish) touching on details that preceded or even caused your embrace.</em></p>

<p>The player's choices in Bloodlines 2 will trickle down to following conversations, possibly even much later in the story. Moreover, they will influence the endings, which will be shown through stylized cinematics that mix images of Seattle with character shapes, inspired by True Detective. According to the developers, there are nearly 40 images for all the different finales in the game. A map of all the endings had to be made so that they could see how they connected, and the concept team used this to create a series of storyboards and choose the right images for each ending shot.</p>
<p>The next Bloodlines 2 developer diary is slated to go live on the official website on January 29. The game still has no release window, although Paradox Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed hope</a> it would launch in the first half of the year, while also clarifying that a potential third installment would be licensed to a third party rather than developed in-house.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-gets-god-of-war-ragnarok-like-a-dragon-gaiden-atlas-fallen-reign-of-sand-and-more-in-january/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has just unveiled the PS Plus lineup for January 2025. It's looking like a great month for subscribers of the Premium and Extra tiers, who will obtain access to games like Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarök, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Deck13's Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand, among others.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest title of the bunch is God of War Ragnarök. A direct sequel to the 2018 masterpiece that redefined an already popular series, God of War Ragnarök successfully maintained the same narrative excellence of the previous installment while delivering a lot more content and new gameplay mechanics. It received a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>God of War Ragnarök is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.</em></p>
<p>The second big game on this month's PS Plus list is Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which Launched in November 2023 as a spin-off of the main series where original Yakuza protagonist Kazuma Kiryu embarked on a new adventure as a secret agent. Taking place roughly at the same time as Yakuza: Like a Dragon, it served as a bridge towards Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where Kazuma returned as a protagonist alongside Ichiban Kasuga. The game got a 7.8 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-what-is-dead-may-never-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name&nbsp;is a bite-sized appetizer meant to satisfy players' appetites for just a few more months until Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits global shores. That being said, Gaiden hits all the marks I want to see in the series: amusing side stories, an epic crime drama that spans multiple games, and all the knuckle shuffles one could ever want.</em></p>
<p>The third big-budget title featured in the January 2025 PS Plus lineup is Deck13's action RPG Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand. This one didn't exactly thrive at launch, though the developers kept working on the game and improved it a few months ago with a sizable update. Here's an excerpt from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-reign-of-sand-enhanced-and-improved-but-still-lacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our updated review (scored 7.3</a>):</p>
<p><em>With welcome improvements, quality of life changes, and new content, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand enhances the game developed by Deck13. However, the update mainly improves the game's existing strengths and fails to address the core issues with its combat system. As a result, the update delivers only partial improvements, leaving those dissatisfied with the game's floaty and unsatisfying combat still wanting more.</em></p>
<p>The remaining titles PS Plus subscribers are getting on January 21 are either indies or niche games, such as SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Sayonara Wild Hearts, ANNO: Mutationem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/orcs-must-die-3-reinforcing-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orcs Must Die 3</a>, Citizen Sleeper, and Poker Club. Lastly, the Premium tier is also being expanded with two classics: MediEvil II and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.</p>
