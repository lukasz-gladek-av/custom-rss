			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">reported</a> the July 2025 sales numbers for the United States based on dollar sales from physical and digital game and hardware sales, revealing that the Nintendo Switch 2 has hit a new sales milestone in the US, while EA Sports College Football 26, somewhat unsurprisingly, absolutely dominates the sales charts for premium game sales.</p>



<p>After Nintendo's last quarterly report showed the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling through 6 million units globally</a>, Piscatella reveals the console's latest regional milestone, that it has now gone beyond 2 million units sold in the US alone. It was also the best-selling piece of video game hardware for July 2025, both in dollar sales and units sold, and just as impressively, the Switch 2 is outpacing the Nintendo Switch by 75% in the US during the same window when the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017.</p>







<p>Moving onto software, EA Sports College Football 26 won in July, taking the top spot for premium game sales across all platforms in the US for the month. Though it was also a win for Madden NFL 26, even though that game only released earlier this month on August 14. EA offered players an MVP bundle which gets you both College Football 26 and Madden NFL 26, and the MVP bundle was the second-best-selling premium title, behind players just getting College Football 26.</p>







<p>In fact, the bundle sold so strongly, as did College Football 26, that both have joined the list of top-20 best-selling games in the US for 2025, with College Football 26 shooting all the way up to third place behind Oblivion Remastered and Monster Hunter Wilds. The MVP bundle made the list in the number 12 spot.</p>







<p>Other notable entries on the software charts include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which was able to grab third place for game sales in the US in July 2025, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, which came in at fourth place.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">Grounded 2</a> was also able to make the charts, but in eighth place when you're looking at premium sales on all platforms. It had a much more impressive top spot when you silo everything down to just PC game sales in the US for July, where it overtook Elden Ring Nightreign, though Nightreign remained at number two.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still has a ways to go if it is going to hit the <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">15 million units sold number that analysts predict it'll reach before 2025 is over</a>, but having already surpassed 6 million globally, 2 million of that being in the US alone, and it's not even holiday season, all point to it at least getting close. We'll see how the rest of the year unfolds. </p>
