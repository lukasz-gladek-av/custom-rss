			<p>It's been confirmed on the official website for Forza Horizon 5 that this previously Xbox-exclusive title will now be coming to PlayStation 5. This is a huge deal for those who were previously unable to play this game due to it only being on Xbox and PC. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/">rumors were circulating</a> months prior, fans will now be able to dive into this game on PlayStation 5 in the Spring.</p>
<p>Since the game was released, it has received over 40 thematic updates, with two expansions and other content added into the game to keep it fresh for the Forza Horizon fans. Now that it's coming to PlayStation 5, players will have access to the nearly 900 cars available in the game, where they will finally be able to drive along Mexico's roads and experience the Horizon Festival.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news post</a> on the Forza website, it was stated that the PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon 5 was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games. For those who may be worried about missing out on content, fear not. The game will come with all of the same content as the Xbox and PC versions of the title. Additionally, Car Packs and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will be available for PlayStation 5 users to purchase should they want to.</p>
<p>The news post also announced that there will be a special free update being added to the game across all platforms, titled Horizon Realms. Realm will allow players to explore a curated collection of the community's favorite previously released Evolving Worlds. There will also be "some other surprises," with details to be released in the future.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist on the PlayStation Store</a> today, where players will be able to get updates about when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be cross-play for all Forza Horizon 5 players across Xbox consoles, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>With Xbox deciding to do away with console exclusives, it will be interesting to see what further Xbox exclusives are revealed to be making their way over to PlayStation 5 in the future. Whether this means PlayStation will see titles like Halo or Senua's Saga: Hellblade II remains to be seen, but we can only hope they will be ported over in the future.</p>

			<p>The official reveal trailer has dropped for The Directorate: Novitiate, revealing a new narrative-driven single-player game that will be a third-person action RPG, with the game taking place in Los Angeles. This title is being developed and published by Nesting Games.</p>
<p>The year is 2006, and the world is magic-infused. In this game, you'll be playing as Mercury, where you will get to use a mixture of guns and magic to fight off supernatural threats and chase down a serial killer across Los Angeles. To see what you can expect from The Directorate: Novitiate, make sure to check out the official reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Directorate: Novitiate â€“ Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XH0XEYavkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for this game has been released, revealing the base features you need to know about the game. If you liked<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-trademarks-fbc-firebreak/"> Control</a> or Alan Wake, then this may be a game you want to keep an eye on. It has very similar themes and styles of combat, from what is seen in the GIFs on Steam.</p>
<p>Kana Luna (Mercury) finds her life turned upside down as she becomes involved with the Costa Muerta, a Dark Syndicate of the Directorate. Because of this, she now needs to hone her skills, where you'll help her rise up from the rank of Novitiate.</p>
<p>It will be much more than just guns and magic, as there will be a high-stakes story to go along with it. While you will get to experience the traditional third-person shooter mechanics, there will also be magic spells that you can utilize, as well as the ability to upgrade your skills and perform finishing moves that add flare and style to the scene.</p>
<p>As with any high-stakes story, there will also be important player decisions to be made, where your choices will impact the story later down the line. You have to make the decision on whether you want to remain loyal to the Edicts of the Directorate or choose to stay in the real world. However, this will all have consequences for friends, foes, and more.</p>
<p>At the moment, the game doesn't have a planned release date, with more details to come in the future and a release period to be confirmed at a later date.</p>
<p>Will you be playing The Directorate: Novitiate when it releases?</p>
