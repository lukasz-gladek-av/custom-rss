			<p>The Steam publishing guidelines have been recently updated with a new clause that  prevents the release of certain types of content on the platform if they violet payment processors and banks rules.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/">Automaton</a>, the Rules and Guidelines section of the Steamworks Documentation has been recently updated with a new clause that prohibits the publication of "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steamâ€™s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers." The clause clarifies that this refers to certain kinds of adult-only content, of which there's a lot on the Valve platform. A few hours ago, SteamDB confirmed that several games that are definitely in violation of this new rule have been removed from the store, although it's still unconfirmed if their removal has anything to do with the new publishing guidelines clause.</p>



<p>As payment processors and card networks have very strict rules regarding adult content, it was only a matter of time before adult content on Steam would be impacted. Hopefully, the clause will only impact content that's in clear violation of the rule and won't be used to further limit what can be published on Steam, regardless of the presence of what is deemed adult content by a third party.</p>



<p>Besides the addition of the new clause, the rest of the Steam publishing Rules and Guidelines haven't been changed. You can check them out by going <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">here.</a></p>
