			<p>Later today, <strong>Battlefield 6 Season 2</strong> will kick off in earnest on all platforms. The second season of the military first-person shooter's live service was famously <strong>delayed for about a month</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing outrage in the game's community</a>.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, producer <strong>Phil Girette</strong> has explained why that happened, while also suggesting it won't happen again following changes made internally across the various departments at <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> (which comprises DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio).</p>



<p><em>We came out of the launch from Battlefield 6, and we don't have the best of track records for launches, but it went pretty smooth this time around, so we're happy for that one. But that launch also takes a lot of work and time. We saw the content we had planned for Battlefield 6 Season 2 and we wanted just to give that a little bit more time in the oven to polish things and make sure we hit the expectations that players have.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, once you plan out seasons, there's a lot of things that come with that like the marketing work behind it, making sure the timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things. Future seasons as well. Absolutely, we need to make sure those hit as expected and we have taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly music for the ears of active players, although they may be more concerned with Battlefield 6 Season 2 itself. Our David <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a couple of hours of the new content in advance</a></strong> during a press preview event, and <strong>he wasn't exactly thrilled with what he saw</strong>:</p>



<p><em>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</em></p>



<p><em>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Battlefield 6 Season 2 right now.</em></p>

			<p>Cyanide's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx</em> series may not be a household name for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stealth games</strong>, but it still managed to carve out a niche for itself thanks to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid gameplay</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">personable protagonist</strong>, a rogue goblin called Styx who's never afraid to voice his mind. No one would probably call <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Master of Shadows</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong></a></em> the most accomplished of games, but, at the same time, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">no one would deny how both games have plenty of heart.</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">For nine years</strong>, Styx and his begrudging companions, including the former goblin hunter Helledryn and the dark elf Djarak, have been <strong>away</strong> from our screens, and for their return, Cyanide planned <strong>something big</strong>. Since the launch of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, <strong>video games have changed a lot</strong>, and <strong>a linear stealth experience wouldn't have cut it</strong>. </p>



<p>As such, <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> overhauls the series' formula with a more&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/">complex world design</a></strong>,&nbsp;sandbox features, and a more open-ended structure that make the experience feel quite modern. Though still a <strong>little rough around the edges</strong>, the game delivers an <strong>engaging stealth experience</strong> without sacrificing the heart that has always characterized the series.</p>

<p>Following the end of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Shards of Darkness</em>, Styx returns in a new adventure where he is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hunting for Quartz</strong>, a magical resource that is as powerful as it is dangerous for any who can absorb it. This time around, Styx doesn't have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rely solely on his wit and caustic humor</strong>. Alongside Helledryn and Djarak, the rogue goblin <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">assembles a crew</strong> to help him secure the Quartz while staying one step ahead of the Inquisition. Their journey provides a front-row seat to the onset of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Great War</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">eventual formation of the Black Hand</strong>, the legendary mercenary group first seen in <em>Of Orcs and Men</em>.</p>



<p>Although <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">does not attempt to do anything revolutionary</strong> with its characters and fantasy settings, there's no denying that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx remains a compelling protagonist</strong> and the most interesting member of the cast. His trademark <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">caustic humor</strong> is intact, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">his remarks</strong> on anything that happens around him make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adventure memorable</strong>. On the other hand, the game provides <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a slightly deeper look</strong> at the goblin: every time he absorbs a fragment of Quartz, Styx is confronted by a mysterious entity called the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Flux</strong>, which not only plays an important role in the story, but also offers the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> chance to delve deper into the goblin's personality and motivations</strong>, painting a slightly more rounded picture of the character.</p>

<p>While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">supporting cast lacks Styx’s magnetic cynicism</strong>, they are fleshed out enough to feel like functional parts of the machine rather than mere set dressing. Generally,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> there really isn't anything so memorable aside from Styx</strong> that would get anyone to delve deeper into this fantasy world's lore, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">what is there is interesting enough</strong> to provide a decent enough motivation to push towards the next Quartz.</p>



<h2 id="h-just-a-goblin-in-an-open-world">Just a Goblin in an Open World</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed's sandbox experience is one of the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">developer Cyanide couldn't go with the same linear sort of stealth experience</strong> featured in the previous entry in the series for the new game. <strong>The stealth genre has greatly evolved</strong> since the days of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, with an emphasis on open-level design and sandbox mechanics that simply couldn't be ignored in<em> Styx: Blades of Greed.</em></p>



<p>In this regard,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> the new entry in the series delivers</strong>, for sure. <strong>Locations</strong> such as The Wall, the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn, and the Ruins of Akenash, the elven capital, are <strong>much more open than anything the series has featured to date</strong>, with an open-world sandbox flair that gives the adventure a very personable feel.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Even in the Prologue, this feeling is unmistakable. </strong>Reaching The Wall with their zeppelin, Styx and his gang find themselves stranded in a location filled with all sorts of dangers, ranging from gangs of thieves and marauders and the powerful Inquisition, and it will only be with the help of some new allies that they will be able to take it up to the skies again in search of Quartz. Although in this early segment of the game Styx will have to recruit a new dwarven pilot and save a specific individual from the Inquisition <strong>in a set order</strong>, the <strong>openness</strong> of the experience is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The pronounced vertical design elevates stealth gameplay considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These early objectives may be set, but the options are not</strong>: to infiltrate the tavern where the dwarf pilot resides, for example, players can scale the tavern itself to enter the dwarf's room from a window, or infiltrate it from the main entrances, creating all sorts of distractions for the enemies inside, and so on.</span> Right from the onset, the locations' <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">vertical design is remarkable</strong>, providing so many opportunities for stealth and concealament that make the experience <strong>very engaging from the get-go</strong>, even with the limited tools Styx has at his disposal in the first few hours, which will be later <strong>expanded</strong> via the game's progression system with new gadgets and special powers, including the ability to create clones, improved perception to spot enemies hidden by environmental elements and so on.</p>



<p>Once the first Quartz is absorbed and the crew takes to the skies again, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the training wheels come off</strong>, and it's here that the experience turns into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a full sandbox stealth game</strong>. With a compass in tow, Styx will have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">search for multiple Quartz fragments scattered all over locations in any order the player wishes</strong>, with a challenge that can be greater or lower depending on the unlocked upgrades, with only the occasional forced story quest acting as a progression threshold every now and then. These Quartz-hunting missions are also <strong>quite varied</strong> and are never as straightforward as simply reaching a location. Something unexpected always happens, forcing players to always be on their toes and never grow complacent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Varied mission design is another of Styx: Blades of Greed's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides featuring a solid vertical design, the<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Styx: Blades of Greed</em> maps have a marked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metroidvania feel</strong> centered on two of Styx's new tools: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Grappling Hook and the Glider</strong>. Unlocked a few hours into the adventure, both tools can be used to<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> access previously unaccesible locations</strong>, making not only the entire experience deeper with new stealth options, but also make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">progression more meaningful</strong> in a very tangible way, especially in light how many of core's upgrades to Styx's toolset are maybe unlocked a tad too slowly, often <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">requiring multiple Quartz shards</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blueprints</strong> to unlock via the game's skill trees. </p>



<p><span>Still, these unlocks are rather<strong>&nbsp;rewarding</strong>, especially the Quartz powers that give Styx some very powerful tools, such as <strong>Mind Control</strong>, moving at <strong>Super Speed</strong>, and unleashing a </span><strong><span>F</span>lux Blast</strong> to get rid of enemies. These, in combination with the <strong>passive abilities</strong> granted by Runes, give a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">build flexibility</strong> in a game that has no loot whatsoever.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-am-what-my-enemies-make-of-me">I Am What My Enemies Make of Me</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-enemies-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Enemy AI is not the best in Styx: Blades of Greed</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">core element</strong> that is required for a proper stealth experience is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid enemy AI</strong>, but it's here that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> starts to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some cracks</strong>. Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy variety is overall decent</strong>, with multiple human and non-human enemies, including stronger enemies that cannot be disposed of with a single stealth kill attempt and require more guile to eliminate, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">their AI leaves something to be desired at times.</strong> Their keen hearing forces players to proceed carefully to avoid tripping over chairs and other environmental elements, making noise, and their reasonable, decent sight, especially at long distances, forces a careful approach. However, there are times when the enemy doesn't see Styx even if he is located nearby and not exactly in concealment.</p>



<p>Thankfully, at the very least, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enemies are relentless when alerted</strong> and will hunt Styx until he manages to get away, so the experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains challenging</strong>, even if the AI sometimes falters. Unfortunately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it's </strong>during these frantic escapes that the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> roughness of the experience</strong> is felt the most: the basic control scheme is a little <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complicated</strong>, and doesn't feel very natural at the beginning, leading to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wrong action at the wrong time</strong>; <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">melee combat is terribly basic</strong>, limited to a dodge and dagger attack, and requires locking onto an enemy first, which is an unnatural setup for most third-person action games. In addition, there are too many times when Styx is <strong>stuck mid-jump in geometry elements</strong>, which can lead to some undeserved defeats in certain situations.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Enemies-02-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Though not the smartest enemies ever in stealth games, the Inquisition and Styx's other foes leave no stone unturned once alerted</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Luckily, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">any defeat is not the end of the world</strong>, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> allows players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">make quick saves at almost any time</strong>, even with a controller. This is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great quality-of-life inclusion</strong> that was essentially required, as the game does often rely on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">trial-and-error</strong>, especially at the beginning, and the experience would have been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">way too frustrating</strong> without it. Hardcore fans of the series can ignore this feature and even disable it altogether by playing the game at the <strong>highest difficulty level</strong>.</p>



<p>Weighing what the game does well, and what doesn't in gameplay terms, it's clear how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sits comfortably in the same space</strong> as its predecessors. It doesn't revolutionize stealth gameplay in any way, it's a little rough around the edges, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">lacking</strong> some quality-of-life features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a detailed map</strong> that would be essential for a sanbox experience like this (a few times too many I had to look around the map to find a fast travel point that would bring me to the airship), has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">imperfect enemy AI</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cumbersome controls</strong>, and maybe <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">too much trial-and-error</strong>, but it compensates this with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great level design</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a lot of heart</strong>, which is evident in its around <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">20 hours long experience</strong>. The total playtime can vary a lot depending on your stealth skills and how much you explore locations for optional items, and if you engage with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">character-focused side objectives</strong> that provide some light development to Styx's crew.</p>

<p>The convoluted controls, the main character sometimes getting stuck in environmental geometry, and the wider assortment of bugs (including being able to take down enemies by grabbing them through walls), unfortunately, are only the <strong>tip of the proverbial iceberg</strong> regarding <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>'s <strong>technical state</strong>. <strong>Given the level of visuals</strong> the game pushes, which are acceptable but far from groundbreaking, <strong>one would expect solid performance</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>that is not the case.</strong></p>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, on PC, the game suffers from the widely known <strong>traversal stuttering issues</strong>, for which nothing the<strong> shader pre-compilation step</strong> can do. They are not terribly frequent, but they happen often enough that it is impossible not to notice them. </p>

<p><strong>General performance does not fare well</strong>, either. On my high-end system (<strong>i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM</strong>)<span>, the game averaged&nbsp;<strong>55 FPS, 27 1% low</strong>, in a benchmark session conducted on The Wall map at&nbsp;<strong>4K resolution with DLSS in Balanced mode, high settings,</strong></span><strong> and no Frame Generation</strong>. Needless to say, the game would be essentially unplayable <strong>without upscaling</strong> on anything but the absolute top-end systems. </p>



<p>Thankfully,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> hitting close to 60 FPS without any frame generation tech</strong> made the game play relatively smoothly with either DLSS or FRS Frame Generation. As it isn't an intense action title that requires split-second reactions, this is generally more than enough to enjoy it, no matter how technically disappointing this level of performance is. However, since most players don't have a beefy system like mine, I'd suggest you wait for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">more tests on lower-end hardware before committing to a purchase on PC if you</strong> <strong>don't have a top-end machine</strong></p>

				<p>Styx: Blades of Greed is the definition of a solid 'AA' game. It struggles under the weight of its own ambition and some Unreal Engine 5 optimization woes, but its charming main character and quality of its sandbox level design make it a game that those looking for an almost pure stealth experience will love.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 16/02/2026 6:00pm ET:</strong> Following the publication of this story, a representative from <strong>Hasbro</strong> sent this statement to Wccftech:</p>



<p>"<em>The Snake Eyes game is <strong>not cancelled</strong>. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven't been finalized, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Original Story 16/02/2026 4:43pm ET:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Atomic Arcade</strong>, the <strong>Hasbro</strong> and <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>-owned studio that was making a game based on the iconic <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> character <strong>Snake Eyes</strong>, has reportedly been <strong>shut down</strong>. The news broke from one of the former team members, gameplay programmer <strong>Dominic Braun</strong>, shared on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-activity-7429184370877345793-37wz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> that he had been laid off following "<em>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast's decision to close Atomic Arcade</em>."</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no official word from Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or Atomic Arcade confirming the closure or the fate of the Snake Eyes game. We've reached out to Hasbro for comment and will update this article if/when we hear back or if an official statement is delivered through other verified channels.</p>



<p>We first heard about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-has-a-big-budget-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-in-the-works/1100-6506502/">back in 2022,</a> with Atomic Arcade seemingly being formed for the purpose of making this Snake Eyes game. While the studio was active in sharing notices that it was looking to grow its team between 2022 and 2025, with the last major update being a sneak peek at the Snake Eyes model from Atomic Arcade back in <a href="https://x.com/AtomicArcadeStu/status/1922305837042991257">May 2025.</a></p>



<p>It's the latest studio shutdown and mass layoff of the year, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> kicked off 2026 by embarking on a "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that included multiple studio shutdowns. We've also seen layoffs from <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Meta</strong> that ended <strong>Camouflaj's</strong> award-winning run of developing VR games</a>, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/">cutting nearly half of the <strong>2XKO</strong> development team shortly</a> after the game's 1.0 release, and most notably, <strong>Highguard</strong> developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">cutting "<em>most</em>" of its team</a>, barely two weeks after Highguard launched.</p>



<p>But at least in all of those cases, the studios impacted had gotten a game across the finish line. Atomic Arcade, seemingly, did not get the same chance, and now it seems like G.I. Joe and Snake Eyes fans who have been waiting for a major release based on the iconic ninja will have to wait a while longer.</p>



<p>It's also one less game coming from Hasbro's IPs, as we know that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">currently several games from Hasbro-owned IPs on their way</a>.</p>
