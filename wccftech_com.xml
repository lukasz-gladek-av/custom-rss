			<p>The Callisto Protocol PS5 Pro patch greatly enhanced image quality and performance while also introducing an 8K resolution mode that delivers a visual experience without compromise, according to a new analysis of the patch.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vez2JZxDYSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, Digital Foundry provided their own analysis of the PS5 Pro patch released for Striking Distance's game, highlighting how the patch improves Performance Mode considerably by adding the ray tracing features only available in Quality Mode on the base model while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. This is seemingly achieved by lowering the resolution, as on the mid-generation console, the pixel count hits 1440p and 1296p in areas where it is higher on the base model's Performance mode, although the image is definitely sharper on the new system. In addition, the game also achieves better performance on the new PlayStation 5 model by using TAAU instead of AMD FSR 2 or PSSR, as the artifacts that indicate that either are being used are nowhere to be seen. As such, it is not clear if Striking Distance simply used the additional GPU power of the system to brute force these improvements in some ways or had access to the PS5 Po exclusive features that can only be used with more recent SDK versions.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the 8K mode introduced in The Callisto Protocol with the PS5 Pro patch. This mode is not as impressive as the No Man's Sky 8K mode, as it features a slightly sharper image than the 4K resolution mode and not much else. As such, Digital Foundry theorizes that this mode employs a dynamic resolution range that hits up to 6K and then upscales the image to 8K.</p>

			<p>Activision and developer Treyarch have proudly <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1861092582257807478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the biggest entry in the already massive franchise one month after its release. That's counting figures like total players, hours played, and total matches. Interestingly, the actual numbers were not shared, but they must be massive, given the IP.</p>
<p>The news is not surprising, given the great <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start</a> in the game's first week. Black Ops 6 also registered new records for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet traffic in the UK</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Xbox players</a> checking out the game, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-games-consumer-spending-up-by-10-after-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove US spending on games up by 10%</a>. Certainly, the fact that this is the first time a new Call of Duty game has launched on Game Pass helped a lot with setting new total player, hour played, and total match records.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received Wccftech's seal of approval from Kai Tatsumoto's review, too. Here's what he had to say about the latest entry in the shooter series:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesnâ€™t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>
