			<p>Every edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> needs a headliner announcement, and this year, it was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Don’t recognize that name? You shouldn’t, it’s a new IP, but you will recognize the developer – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p>The first teaser trailer for Intergalactic is light on details, but we are introduced to Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who’s tracking a quarry to the dangerous planet of Sempiria. Most of the trailer is focused on showing off Jordan and Naughty Dog’s always-cutting-edge facial animation tech, but we do get a hint of what gameplay might be like at the end of the video as we see our hero taking on a robotic enemy with a laser sword. So, it looks like the focus is on melee combat and the inhospitable planet hints at perhaps survival elements. But enough of my preamble, take a look at Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Consider me intrigued! We’ve known for a while that The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann’s next thing would be a new sci-fi IP, and this is obviously it. We don’t know yet if Druckmann is actually writing and/or directing Intergalactic but his name is attached to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> that reveals a bit more info about the game…</p>
<p><em>“Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</em></p>
<p><em>Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line. Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game.”</em></p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet has been announced for PS5. A release window has yet to be revealed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/okami-is-getting-a-sequel-with-hideki-kamiya-once-again-taking-the-reigns.1060398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya made the surprising announcement that he was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the studio he co-founded, PlatinumGames</a>. At the time, we didn’t know what Kamiya’s next step might be, but now we do. Tonight at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> we got a first peek at a revival of another beloved Kamiya creation – Okami.</p>
<p>At present, the new game doesn’t have an official title, it’s simply being referred to as “Okami Sequel.” The brief teaser trailer shows Amaterasu running across a large open field, perhaps implying the new game’s world will be expanded compared to the original. While the visual style of the game has been updated somewhat, it still definitely has a “painted” look. And yes, at the end we get the words “Game Director Hideki Kamiya” so now we know why he left Platinum. The new game will be produced at Kamiya’s new studio Clovers, a revival of sort of Clover Studio, which created the original Okami. But enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Okami sequel - Project Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like most folks with good taste, I enjoyed Okami a lot, so I’m definitely excited to see a new one. Here’s hoping Kamiya has another classic in him. Here's a bit more information about the project, directly from Capcom...</p>
<p><em>"The Okami sequel project is underway!! Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hideki Kamiya, director of the original Okami, will be the director of this project, which is being co-developed between studios that include various staff members of the original Okami: M-TWO Inc., Machine Head Works Inc., and CLOVERS Inc., which Hideki Kamiya is a member of.</em></p>
<p><em>What will the new adventures of Amaterasu and company be like? It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project."</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release date for the Okami Sequel have yet to be announced. What do you think? Excited to break out the paintbrush again?</p>
