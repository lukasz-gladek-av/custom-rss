			<p>Yesterday, we got <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> from Circana (formerly NPD) that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered performed very well in the United States last month, managing to outperform the original's 15-month sales in a single month.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo</a> has doubled down on the praise with its own global report on engagement and revenue in April. Oblivion Remastered was second only to Fortnite thanks to an 'outstanding' performance, according to Newzoo, and the analysts called it a benchmark for a successful remaster. Minecraft benefited from the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking movie</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runescape: Dragonwilds</a> both had successful debuts.</p>
<p>Here's the full overview for the month of April 2025 across PC and console games, per Newzoo:</p>
<h2><em><strong>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong> (#2, new) delivered outstanding revenue performance following its surprise launch on April 22, despite the absence of any formal pre-release marketing. The game’s success underscores the enduring power of the IP, the quality of the remaster, and the appeal of its $50 price point, making it a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II / III / Warzone / Black Ops 6&nbsp;</strong>(#3, +7) saw strong momentum with the launch of Season 3 on April 2, which introduced new maps, content, cosmetics, and a new Battle Pass. A key highlight is the reintroduction of a revamped version of Verdansk; the original Battle Royale map in Warzone, tapping into the nostalgia trend which recently enjoys great popularity.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#5, +7) continued its upward trajectory, drawing significant attention and gaining over 4.5 million new players during April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Counter-Strike 2 &amp; GO</strong>&nbsp;(#6, +7) surged following Valve’s release of three new weapon collections (cosmetic skins) on April 1, driving renewed engagement and spend.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft</strong> (#8, +6) climbed in the rankings despite offering movie-themed DLCs and add-ons for free on the Minecraft Marketplace, showcasing the franchise’s exceptional engagement and monetization strength. It’s also worth highlighting that Premium Revenue in April saw a very significant increase, marking this month one of the strongest ever for Minecraft full-game sales.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Forza Horizon 5 (</strong>#9, +69) experienced a substantial boost as the former Xbox/PC exclusive launched on PlayStation at the end of April, expanding its reach to a new audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +8) saw an increase in revenue despite a slight decline in MAU rank. The launch of Season 2 on April 4 introduced new monetization drivers, including a Battle Pass and cosmetic content, which encouraged player spending.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>&nbsp;(#13, new) exceeded sales expectations, surpassing 2 million units sold within just 12 days of launch. The title has resonated strongly with both players and critics, reflecting the impact of a clear creative vision and the dedication of its development team.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</strong>&nbsp;(#16, new) launched in Early Access on April 15 and attracted nearly one million monthly active users in just the second half of the month. Its early success underscores the enduring appeal of the RuneScape IP and the compelling execution of its survival gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2><em><strong>Engagement Highlights</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft&nbsp;</strong>(#3, null) no movement on the ladder, but Minecraft achieved a record high in monthly active users (MAU) in April, thanks to the success of "A Minecraft Movie." The game attracted both old and new players, selling over 700K copies in April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +16) received its first Early Access content update on April 10 and continues to build momentum, maintaining an impressive 98% positive rating on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>R.E.P.O.&nbsp;</strong>(#13, -1) remains a strong performer in Early Access, sustaining player engagement and earning an overwhelmingly positive review score of 96% on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</strong>(#14) highlights the enduring power of the franchise, entering the top 20 for both MAU and revenue despite launching without pre-release marketing. Notably, most of its MAUs stem from Xbox, following its day-one inclusion in Game Pass.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (#18, -7) is gradually transitioning from a broader appeal to a more dedicated core audience. As expected, PlayStation users are demonstrating the highest retention, driven by the platform’s strong presence in Japan, Monster Hunter's key market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Overwatch 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</strong>(#19, -1) slipped one position, even as the percentage of recent positive Steam reviews more than doubled (48%) compared to its lifetime average (23%). Season 16, which<a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduced a new game mode – Stadium-</a> appears to be a step in the right direction, but fierce competition and a month-over-month decline in console MAU continue to present challenges.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Over the years, Rockstar Games and Take-Two have filed multiple patents that highlight how Grand Theft Auto VI will revolutionize open-world games forever.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Alerts recently posted on <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> a recap of ten patents owned by Rockstar Games that highlight how the game will push video game boundaries forward to offer an experience like few others. The patents include<a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140270578450830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tech for the creation of lifelike characters</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140273917108735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation of fluid flow on 3D surfaces</a>, seamless NPC movement powered by a <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140277536825480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">road network graph</a> for smooth virtual navigation, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140281114566866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced graphics rendering</a> with sharper details, better lighting and smoother performance, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140285455696244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuous level of detail</a> for models which will make buildings, cars and NPCs look great no matter their position relative to the camera, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140289750598054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced load times in online sessions</a> that will allow users to join others seamlessly, use of motion capture in conjunction with AI to predict <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140293563228503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body pose</a>, a system that manages <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140297015218414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-game transactions</a>, use of <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140306066550898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data-driven blocks for animations</a>, allowing characters to adapt to any situation without requiring rigid coding, and enhanced anti-cheat measures with <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140309447164001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden game variables</a>. Each individual patent can be checked out in full by searching for the patent number in <a href="https://patents.google.com/">Google Patents.</a></p>
<p>Little has been shown so far of Grand Theft Auto VI, but given Rockstar Games' history, there's no doubt that it will be among the most impressive open-world games ever released, even if it ends up using only a portion of the tech showcased in the patents above. Sadly, fans of the series will have to wait longer than anticipated to return to Vice City, as the game won't launch this year as originally announced, and will debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S only in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 2026</a>. At least, the bad news of the delay was accompanied by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">a new trailer</a>, which provided a second, great look at the game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26th on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Nintendo Switch 2 Ports Are Reportedly in the Works, and Will Be Revealed Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-nintendo-switch-2-ports-are-reportedly-in-the-works-and-will-be-revealed-soon.1196079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ports of Xbox games for Nintendo Switch 2 are currently in the works, and their reveal should be imminent, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>The Verge's Tom Warren confirmed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory">recent report</a> focused on the announcement of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced, which is launching on PlayStation 5 this Summer, that Microsoft is also working on some Xbox ports for Nintendo Switch 2, which he expects will be revealed soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate also said the same on X, so we should probably expect to see the announcement of the first few ports in the coming weeks during the "non-E3" season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next up: Xbox games coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925234110588473837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft already having released ports of Xbox games on the original Nintendo Switch, such as Sea of Thieves and Grounded, it's not surprising to learn that more games will be coming to the next-generation system, which promises to be extremely successful at launch. As for which Xbox games could hit the Nintendo Switch 2, no one can say at the moment, but it's been previously rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> will launch on the system. Seeing the latter run on Nintendo Switch 2 would be quite interesting from a technical standpoint, as the game can be quite demanding, although if Asobo Studio managed to get the game running on Xbox Series S, it will definitely be possible to scale the game to the Switch 2 hardware capabilities, which may be better than anticipated, judging from how <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the system.</a></p>
