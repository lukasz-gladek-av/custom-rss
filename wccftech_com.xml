			<p>A new nine-minute clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> gameplay has debuted through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9sqrkte-QQ">IGN</a> that showcases protagonist Enzo embarking on a mission to bring in an enemy of Don Salieri alive.</p>



<p>The mission begins with a short cutscene where Enzo gets the order from Don Salieri himself, presenting Enzo with a chance to prove himself to Salieri and to the rest of the family. Enzo is then escorted to where he can gear up to deal with the "<em>pest problem</em>," which is how the members of the family refer to his assignment. Once he's chosen the proper tools for the job, we get a good look at the Italian countryside while Enzo drives to his target's home.</p>



<p>When he gets there, we get a good look at some stealth combat before all hell breaks loose and Enzo is exchanging bullets with guards, giving us a better look at the third-person gunplay in Mafia: The Old Country. Once he reaches his target, the gameplay fades out before the cutscene finishes, as Enzo knocks his target unconcious.</p>

<p>Even with this clip being cut in areas where developer Hangar 13 clearly wanted to keep things hidden, it's still the best look at gameplay we'd had since 2K and Hangar 13 started to properly showcase the game earlier this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-has-gone-gold-ahead-of-its-august-release/">Mafia: The Old Country officially went gold last month</a>, ahead of its early-August release date, as Hangar 13 works to polish what it believes will be "<em>the best-looking Mafia game</em>.<em>"</em> We'll see how well it lives up to those expectations, and the rest of the expectations Hangar 13 has set for the game, when it arrives on August 8, 2025.</p>

			<p>If you are someone who cares even a little bit about video game preservation, then you've likely heard of the Stop Killing Games initiative. A consumer-focused movement petition with the goal of gaining enough signatures so that a new law can be proposed to the UK parliament and the European Commission to disallow publishers and developers from making games that can be taken offline and rendered unplayable. </p>



<p>"<em>An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods,</em>" the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games website reads</a>, "<em>with no stated expiration date, but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.</em> <em>This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible</em>."</p>



<p>Stop Killing Games was first started by YouTuber Ross Scott, who took Ubisoft shutting down The Crew as the match with which to light the movement's fire. There's also an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">ongoing lawsuit over The Crew being shut down</a>, but that is separate from the petition Scott began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The largest campaign ever to stop publishers destroying games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Scott began campaigning for signatures, it seemed like his first win came early, when Ubisoft announced it would make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">offline versions of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a> available for players. It's unclear if the pressure from Stop Killing Games is what led to the decision, but it's difficult to imagine it wasn't a part of the conversation. However, no one (at least not video game publishers) suspected Stop Killing Games would gain enough traction to actually put pressure on the industry's largest publishers and developers. That was, until Scott announced that the petition had surpassed 1 million signatures.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The site says we have cleared 1 million signatures!  I hate being like this, but there's a chance a significant number of them aren't real.  That means we have to keep signing in overdrive mode to make up for them!  I'll have a video on this later today.<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Even with Scott warning that many of the signatures could be faked, and encouraging anyone who hasn't yet to still sign the petition, that milestone and the signs that Stop Killing Games was going to get its shot at having legislation proposed to prohibit video game makers from creating online-only games that can be shut down forever in a moment was enough for video game publishers and developers to collectively respond to the movement. </p>



<p>Video Games Europe, a collective body that represents the European divisions of the largest publishers and developers in the video game industry, and <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">whose board is comprised of leaders from</a> Roblox, Warner Bros, Epic Games, EA, Activision, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Take-Two, and more, released a statement that was, unsurprisingly, in opposition to Stop Killing Games, claiming that if laws like the ones it is suggesting are passed, making online-focused games would become "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We appreciate the passion of our community;"</em> the <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement from Video Games Europe</a> began. "<em>However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We understand that it can be disappointing for players, but when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws. Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>Scott has published a response to the Video Games Europe statement, immediately pointing to the fact that Stop Killing Games isn't looking to make it impossible for publishers to discontinue their online games. "<em>We are in no way seeking to impede your</em> <em>right to discontinue online services,</em>" Scott says. "<em>We are saying you can shut down your games whenever you want, but you have to do that responsibly, in a way that doesn't take back rights you already sold to customers</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even after a year of campaigning, it is still too early to tell if Stop Killing Games will actually have any impact. The deadline for the petition to be submitted for review is soon approaching, and even after that step, legislation still has to be passed. There are still plenty of opportunities for it to die on the rack. Still, it is clear that Scott has pushed the issue far enough to the point where it could make an impact. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-gpu-is-close-to-xbox-series-s-cpu-to-ps4-says-developer.1237224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications were leaked, fans and experts have been wondering whether Nintendo's new console would be closer in power to last generation's Sony PlayStation 4 or this generation's Microsoft Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-qa-with-virtuos-i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent interview with Virtuos</a>, we received what is possibly the most in-depth technical explanation to date, courtesy of Eoin O’ Grady, Technical Director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos subsidiary), who revealed that games already running at 60 frames per second on the Xbox Series S shouldn't be hard for the Nintendo Switch 2 to run.</p>



<p><em>GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall. CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting.</em></p>



<p>One of the key performance accelerators for the Nintendo Switch 2 is, of course, the upscaler NVIDIA DLSS. We asked him why not many games support it so far, and this was his answer:</p>



<p><em>For games like Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, which feature stylized cartoon-like aesthetics, DLSS may not be needed. Mario Kart, for instance, was in development for many years with the original Switch in mind. Games like these aren’t trying to push graphical fidelity; they have different goals for their art content and tend to hit 60 FPS without relying on DLSS. For third-party games, it’s worth noting that Cyberpunk 2077 has shipped with DLSS. Compared with the Xbox Series S and PS4 versions, DLSS evidently offers better upscaling technology, making a strong case for developers to implement it. More importantly, there are also other games that could benefit from DLSS, but don’t currently utilize it—that often comes down to how these titles are being ported. It is not as simple as taking the PC DirectX implementation of DLSS and running it on the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, DLSS has to be integrated through Nintendo’s NVN2 graphics API, and the extra work required for this might have been deferred by some developers for their initial ports.</em></p>

			<p>The troubles at Xbox may be far from over, as Microsoft's CFO has set an "utterly unrealistic" financial target for the division that will continue to hurt the company's gaming division in the future.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Windows Central's Jez Corden revealed on X that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood supposedly has given Xbox an utterly unrealistic financial requirement that will continue to hurt the division, suggesting that the troubles that led to the latest waves of layoffs are far from being over. The Verge's Tom Warren chimed in on the discussion, saying that these requirements are the reality of the Xbox business following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without the deal, Tom Warren added, revenue would be down, and the Game Pass gamble hasn't paid off yet.</p>

<p>Last week's wave of layoffs at Xbox has been particularly impacftful for a lot of game development studios under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming division, such as Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10, which has lost over 70 employees and has reportedly been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio, Rare, whose Everwild project has been canceled, and The Initiative, which was completely shut down following the cancellation of the Perfect Dark series reboot. ZeniMax Online, developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, was also impacted by the cancellation of their next MMORPG, which was reportedly turning out so well that Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">loved the game</a> when he played it back in March. Other partner studios were also heavily impacted by the latest wave of layoffs, such as Romero Games, the studio founded by the DOOM series co-creator John Romero and his wife Branda Romero, which also  shut down following the cancellation of the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">next FPS</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-trouble-canceled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-may-be-in-trouble-and-could-have-been-canceled-%E2%80%93-rumor.1237137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">rumored Final Fantasy IX remake</a> may be in trouble, and the game could have been canceled altogether, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/post-142366968">ResetERA forums</a>, well-known insider NateDrake commented on the current status of the unannounced remake, saying that, last the insider checked, the game was still in development. However, a fresh check may be needed, as around a month ago, the insider was told the game was in trouble and possibly had been cancelled. Only one source talked about the cancellation, so the information needs to be verified first, the insider added.</p>



<p>The possibility of the Final Fantasy IX remake having been cancelled couldn't have come at a worse time, as today marks the game's 25th anniversary. Many expected July 7 would be the perfect day to announced the rumored remake, but Square Enix, however, only released a special anniversary movie, which you can watch below, to mark the occasion. You can watch the movie below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake was originally revealed via a massive GeForce NOW database leak, which revealed a lot of unreleased projects at the time. In Square Enix's case, every game revealed by the leak proved to be real, with the exception of the remake of the ninth entry in the popular JRPG series, so there's no doubt that it has been in the works at some point. Hopefully, development hasn't been canceled, and players will be able to travel across the world of Gaia with Zidane and his companions again to experience one of the best entries in the series like they never did before.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-is-unsustainable-and-harmful-to-the-industry-says-arkane-founder.1237128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Microsoft's latest round of layoffs, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw over 9K lose their jobs</a>, including many at various Xbox-owned gaming studios, former Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to explain that, in his opinion, Game Pass is one of the main culprits, not to mention potentially damaging to the industry as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Game Pass). I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by Microsoft’s “infinite money”, but at some point, reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.</em></p>



<p><em>What might happen once Microsoft has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up. Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsidized by Microsoft bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real</em>.</p>



<p>Colantonio is in tune with Rhys Elliott, Head of Market Analysis at Alinea, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that Microsoft bet on the wrong horse by putting so much effort into pushing its Game Pass subscription service. Games simply do not work in the same way as film or music since they take much longer to consume, and there's only so much spare time that users can dedicate to entertainment.</p>



<p>Anyway, Colantonio later added that Game Pass could only co-exist if it's focused on back catalogue games.</p>



<p><em>I’m fed up with all the BS they fed us at first, like “don’t worry, it doesn’t impact the sales”, only to admit years later that it totally does. “No shit it does! Really?” The only way Game Pass can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially Sony's strategy with PlayStation Plus: <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-says-playstation-plus-engagement-has-never-been-higher-still-wont-add-first-party-games-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never put big games there on day one</a>, only add them at a later date, when they enter the back catalogue phase. However, Microsoft is currently still very much keen to maintain its promise to consumers to bring all of its games to Game Pass when they launch. Even so, despite adding franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and DOOM, the total number of subscribers is believed to be around 35 million, far lower than Microsoft's lofty goals.</p>



<p>As a side note, Raphael Colantonio is the studio founder of WolfEye Studios, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird West</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;The studio is now developing a retro sci-fi first-person action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/" target="_blank">inspired by Dishonored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank">published by NEOWIZ</a>. It's not the first time Colantonio slams Microsoft, by the way—</span>that already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-founder-slams-microsoft-for-closing-the-austin-studio-explains-why-immersive-sims-arent-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following last year's decision to close Arkane Austin</a>, his former studio. </p>
