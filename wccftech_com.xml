			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>

<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the project that CD Projekt RED just can't put down, as the studio has <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">announced</a> that it is releasing yet another significant update for the game, with Patch 2.3, that'll be revealed in full tomorrow, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in one of the studio's RED Streams livestream presentations. </p>



<p>It'll premiere at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST, and you'll be able to tune in either on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cdprojektred">Twitch</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aFLKoZaHak8">YouTube</a>. The stream will feature PaweÅ‚ Sasko, the associate game director on the upcoming sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and Adrien Jouannet, the lead designer at Virtuos. </p>



<p>While we don't know exactly what this new update will include, the announcement post on the game's official X account includes a few hints that point to the update specifically dealing with cars in Cyberpunk 2077. "<em>We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update</em>," the post reads. It then calls Sasko and Jouannet <em>"passengers," </em>and adds an emoji of a tire to cap everything off. </p>

<p>Beyond this new update, it's already a big week for Cyberpunk 2077, since the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-arriving-for-macs-this-week/">officially coming to Apple Silicon Mac users this week, on July 17, 2025</a>. Which is the second new platform for Cyberpunk 2077 this year, after it also arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> at launch.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED reported sales numbers for Cyberpunk, it had sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">30 million copies</a>. It'll be interesting to see how many more copies it adds to that milestone, with two new platforms in the mix.</p>
