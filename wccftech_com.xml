<p>This month, NVIDIA also added a few extra games to the library compared to the original plans for February, including the Batman: Arkham games (the first step for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-wb-games-titles-starting-with-batman-arkham-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. Games' renewed support of GeForce NOW</a>), Far Cry: New Dawn via PC Game Pass, F1 Manager 2024 via the Epic Games Store, and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trade via PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>On another note, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1iz2xas/membership_updates_free_1month_and_6month_options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update on its transition to an internal payment processing system. According to a representative, starting today, new members are once again going to be able to sign up for GeForce NOW, whether they are planning on a free, 1-month or 6-month membership. These memberships will be available in the US, Canada, and Europe. New members can sign up using a credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. However, there's no update yet on existing GeForce NOW members being able to make changes to their current membership. As a reminder, in the meantime, they can enjoy free gaming without billing.</p>
