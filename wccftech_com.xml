			<p>Ubisoft RedLynx, the Finland-based Ubisoft team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-rising/">Trials Rising</a> that also largely operates as a support studio for Ubisoft projects, who recently helped Massive Entertainment bring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars: Outlaws to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to layoff 60 developers from its team in Helsinki as the studio shifts to specializing in "<em>small screens</em>."</p>



<p>A statement <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">posted on the Ubisoft RedLynx website</a> sticks to the corporate standard by not calling the cuts 'layoffs' but instead "<em>a restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company's global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company's worldwide studio network.</em>"</p>



<p>The final decision on the layoffs will be made after negotiations with the production and administration teams, who are most impacted by the proposed cuts. The RedLynx developers working on the Snowdrop Engine do not seem to be impacted by these proposed layoffs.</p>



<p>These cuts aren't just part of an effort to cut costs, as they are also part of RedLynx being reshaped from its current multiplatform focus to becoming a studio that specializes in "<em>small screens</em>," which surely means mobile devices, but also probably means the Nintendo Switch 2 and optimizing for PC handhelds, particularly after RedLynx's efforts to bring Star Wars: Outlaws to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>If implemented, the proposed changes would refocus Ubisoft RedLynx from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens,</em>" the statement reads. "<em>This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio's unique expertise, starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading</em>."</p>



<p>RedLynx began its life as an independent studio in 2000, with a focus on smaller mobile and browser titles. Its Trials series is what the studio is known for, and part of what led Ubisoft to acquire the studio in 2011.</p>
