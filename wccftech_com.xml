			<p>Since the PlayStation 5's release in late 2020, console hackers have attempted to gain complete access to the system by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, using software exploits to access features not normally available to consumers.</p>



<p>But on <strong>New Year's Eve</strong>, console hacking groups detonated another sort of explosive that could have <strong>massive consequences</strong> for the PlayStation 5 hacking scene, opening the door for <strong>permanent jailbreak, custom firmware, emulation,</strong> and much more.</p>



<p>As detailed in an <strong><a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely well-put-together report by <em>The CyberSec Guru</em></a></strong>, at the end of 2025, people in the PlayStation 5 hacking scene began discussing a <strong>massive data dump</strong> that appeared on <em>psdevwiki.com</em> and private Discord servers. This data dump contained the <strong>Level 0 BootROM keys</strong> for the system.</p>



<p>The <strong>BootROM</strong> is the first piece of code the PlayStation 5 runs when the system is turned on, the <strong>deepest level</strong> of the console's security architecture, which is used to decrypt and verify the initial stages of the system boot chain. As such, acquiring these keys, which are stored in a <strong>read-only chip</strong> and decrypted on boot by the system's APU, <strong><em>essentially means that anyone with these keys literally owns the system.</em></strong></p>



<p>Any exploit based on these keys would <strong>significantly surpass</strong> all software exploits available to date, as the code and keys in the BootROM <strong>cannot be modified</strong> with a software update.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Software Kernel Exploits (Previous)</strong></td><td><strong>Level 0 BootROM Leak (Current)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Patchability</strong></td><td><strong>Fixable</strong> via System Update</td><td><strong>Unpatchable</strong> (Silicon-bound)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence</strong></td><td>Lost after reboot</td><td><strong>Permanent</strong> Custom Firmware potential</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access Level</strong></td><td>User/Kernel land</td><td><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Root of Trust</strong> (Deepest)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware</strong></td><td>Varies by Firmware version</td><td><strong>All existing PS5 models</strong> vulnerable</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>While Sony will likely introduce a <strong>hardware revision (CFI-3000 series)</strong> to rotate these keys in future retail units, the <strong>60+ million consoles</strong> already in homes are now effectively <strong><em>'unlocked' for life.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-what-does-this-mean-for-the-end-user"><strong>What Does This Mean For The End User?</strong></h3>



<p>This massive PlayStation 5 leak has significant implications. Even if any end user gets access to the leaked ROM keys, they would be able to do nothing with them. However, the ability to <strong>decrypt the bootloader</strong> will greatly <strong>accelerate the development of a Custom Firmware</strong> to let the system boot into a modified operating system permanently, without having to run software exploits every time, and with <strong>no risk</strong> of firmware updates patching the vulnerability.</p>



<p>In addition to accelerating the development of custom firmwares, the leaked ROM keys could be a <strong>boon for the emulation scene</strong>, providing emulator developers with the necessary information to enhance the emulator's <strong>compatibility and accuracy</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, the PlayStation 5 could become an <strong>emulation powerhouse</strong> capable of running games released on various systems, potentially even running <strong>PlayStation 3 games natively via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-can-now-run-all-released-playstation-3-games/">RPCS3 emulator</a></strong>, which has been a long-standing community wish. Unfortunately, this could also <strong>pave the way for piracy</strong>, as a custom firmware could run pirated games on any system.</p>



<p><strong><em>'The PlayStation 5 you own today is not the same console it was yesterday. It is now an open book,'</em></strong> concluded <em>The CyberSec Guru</em> in their report, while the community jokes on Sony's HQ now being on fire, which probably is, at least figuratively, considering the severity of this leak.</p>



<p>No matter how the situation is addressed, it will be very interesting to see how the Japanese company will handle this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">critical situation</strong> alongside other potentially crippling hardware issues like the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/all-ps5-consoles-will-eventually-require-maintenance-playstation-5-liquid-metal-degradation/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">liquid metal cooling issues</strong></a>, and what will come with what is set to become an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">epochal leak</em></strong> for console security.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Triple-A John Wick and Saw Games Teased by Lionsgate]]></title>

			<p>It is somewhat of a mystery how, more than eleven years after the first <strong>John Wick</strong> film, there is still no triple-A action game based on the beloved character interpreted by <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>. </p>



<p>2014's John Wick spawned not only sequels but a veritable universe for owner <strong>Lionsgate Studios</strong> to exploit, as seen recently with the <strong>Ballerina</strong> spin-off movie featuring <strong>Ana de Armas</strong>, the single-season prequel TV series, and two future spin-offs, in addition to the highly anticipated fifth mainline entry.</p>



<p>However, gamers were only treated to the indie turn-based strategy game John Wick Hex, a mix between X-COM and Superhot <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed by <strong>Mike Bithell</strong></a>. It was a great game in its own right, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in Wccftech's review</a>, but it was certainly far removed from the cinematic spectacle that we've come to associate with the films. Hex <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually delisted from all stores earlier this year</a>, so it's not even available for purchase any longer.</p>



<p>Back in November 2022, Lionsgate mentioned it was 'exploring' several pitches for a triple-A John Wick game. During the most recent investor call that followed their Q2 2026 report (a complete transcript is available <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LION/earnings/LION-Q2-2026-earnings_call-372593.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Yahoo Finance</a>), <strong>Chairman of the Motion Picture Group Adam Fogelson</strong> provided a small update on this, as well as a game adaptation of the <strong>Saw</strong> horror franchise:</p>



<p><em>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule. I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly unclear, based on the wording, whether the deals have already been signed between Lionsgate and some triple-A developer or not. Even in the best-case scenario, where they are already underway, triple-A game development typically takes at least four to five years nowadays, so <strong>we'd likely have to wait until 2030 or even longer</strong> to actually play these games. Still, both franchises have a lot of potential to become successful gaming adaptations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Please Look Forward to Final Fantasy XIV on Nintendo Switch’, Says Yoshida]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida</strong>, known as the producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong> and the director and producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong>, has teased a port of the popular <strong>MMORPG</strong> to <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> platforms during an in-game New Year celebration on Japanese servers. As <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by the blog Livedoor, when asked about it, he replied 'Please look forward to it.' It's not quite a confirmation, but fans are taking it as a definite sign that progress is being made on that front. </p>



<p>Yoshida previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed the possibility</a> back in June 2024, when he opened the door to the port, but also suggested that it might not happen for quite some time. Now we're into 2026, though, so we might be closer to an announcement.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy XIV director then returned to the topic in a Gamescom 2025 interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, when he mused on the benefits of such a port for existing players and newcomers.</p>



<p><em>For existing Final Fantasy XIV players, if hypothetically a Nintendo Switch 2 version was released, they would have the chance, for example, going through the main story—they could play that on the PC and do raiding on the PC. But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content, and I'm super excited about that sort of possibility for our players.</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV, the younger generation, if they started playing on Switch 2, being an MMO, it could be a genre new to them, and I would be really happy to introduce these new players to the genre and let them have fun with the game. It's precisely because of this that we have started discussions with Nintendo, and so far they have been positive, so I really hope that players can expect good news in the future.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, though, in the New Year message, Yoshida appears to have referenced Switch in general, rather than specifically the Switch 2. Final Fantasy XIV was originally released on the PlayStation 3, so it could certainly run on the Switch, although that platform has long since been abandoned and the latest expansions are a bit more taxing than the base game. The safest bet is to assume that the game will only launch on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, the game recently received patch 7.4, which introduced new Main Scenario Quests,​ a new dungeon, a new Trial,​ the Heavyweight Raid Tier for the Arcadion series,​ an overhaul of the Glamour System Overhaul, and a new​ Frontline map.</p>



<p>Chinese players already have a taste of playing the MMORPG on the go <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-gets-official-announcement-playtesting-begins-soon-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the mobile version</a>, <strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Crystal World</strong>, which was developed by Tencent's LightSpeed Studios and released in China on June 19, 2025. A global launch date has not been confirmed yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> sent the first <strong>GeForce NOW Thursday</strong> blast of the year, revealing the PC games that have entered the library this week and also those scheduled to be added throughout the whole month.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the former list. There's a new indie game that just launched, <strong>My Winter Car</strong>, and four games that have been out for some time but are now being supported by GeForce NOW. Eternights was not at all available on NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform, while the others could be streamed but only if you owned them via Steam; now, they can also be streamed if you own them via the Xbox or Epic Games stores.</p>



<ul>
<li>My Winter Car (New release on Steam, Dec. 29)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/eternights-is-an-action-game-with-dating-sim-elements-set-during-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternights</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> (Epic Games Store, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I continue to be a strong advocate for Don't Nod's <strong>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</strong>. If you enjoy the latest God of War games, this is one you don't want to miss. It's a little less polished, sure, but its overall quality is not that far removed from Santa Monica's acclaimed masterpieces, and it also offers a much greater degree of player agency. <strong>The Casting of Frank Stone</strong> and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong> are also two great titles in their respective genres.</p>



<p>As for the rest of January 2026, GeForce NOW users can expect the following titles to populate their library in the coming weeks:</p>



<ul>
<li>StarRupture (New release on Steam, Jan. 6)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathologic 3</a> (New release on Steam, Jan. 9)</li>



<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check (New release on Steam, Jan. 12)</li>



<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Jan. 20)</li>



<li>Nova Roma (New release Steam, Jan. 22)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-reforged-out-december-3-controller-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> (Steam)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou (Steam)</li>



<li>Supermarket Simulator (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Admittedly, when comparing this list with the official game release schedule, several notable titles are missing, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2XKO</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a></strong>, <strong>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein II</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/front-mission-1st-remake-to-release-this-november-front-mission-3-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Front Mission 3 Remake</a></strong>. That said, it is still possible NVIDIA will add them to GeForce NOW at a later time; the initial list announced at the beginning of each month is usually bolstered by several late additions.</p>
