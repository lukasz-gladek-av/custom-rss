			<p>Former Bethesda Head of Publishing and Communication Pete Hines was recently featured <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">in an interview with Dbltap</a>, which included a rather harsh criticism of subscription services like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Hines opined that, at least as far as he knew before <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-pete-hines-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving Bethesda in October 2023</a>, content makers weren't being properly rewarded when their games were added to these subscription services. </p>



<p><em>I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today. At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack shit – then you have a real problem. You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product. That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</em></p>



<p>Hines, who obviously had experience with Game Pass (Bethesda was bought by Xbox a couple of years before he left the company and immediately started putting games on Microsoft's gaming subscription service), was backed in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief LinkedIn message</a> by former Xbox executive Shannon Loftis, who spent nearly 30 years at Microsoft and was most recently VP of Xbox Game Studios before leaving the company in June 2022. Here's what she said:</p>



<p><em>As a longtime first-party Xbox developer, I can attest that Pete is correct. While Game Pass can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.), the majority of game adoption on Game Pass comes at the expense of retail revenue unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization. I could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates.</em></p>



<p>After some stagnation, though, subscription services spending grew significantly in June 2025 in the US, registering a record month with $562 million, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37olha22k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Circana's Senior Director Mat Piscatella</a>. Of course, that doesn't mean that the game developers and publishers who provided the games have been adequately rewarded. Still, it does mean that the likes of Microsoft and Sony will continue seeking to invest in the business model.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the aforementioned interview, Pete Hines revealed that his biggest regret while at Bethesda was the Fallout 76 Collector's Edition snafu. As you might recall, it was supposed to include a canvas bag, but it was replaced at the last minute with a cheaper nylon bag, leading to fans' outrage. At first, users <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-millions-playing-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were only given 500 Atoms for compensation</a>, and Hines himself did not push to replace the nylon bag with the promised canvas bag as soon as possible. Eventually, though, he realized the mistake, and the canvas bag was sent to those who had ordered that edition.</p>
