			<p>RGG Studio and SEGA have <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/sega-and-rgg-studio-announce-rgg-summit-2025-air-date-tune-in?utm_source=prezly.com&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=SEGA%20and%20RGG%20Studio%20Announce%20RGG%20Summit%202025%20Air%20Date%20%E2%80%93%20TUNE%20IN&amp;utm_id=30fec83b-0cfc-4d7c-8c3e-f1a1e5d758a3&amp;utm_content=story%20header">announced</a> the RGG Summit 2025, and an RGG Direct is coming next month on September 23, at 8pm PT / 11pm ET / September 24 at 4am BST. While there are no specific projects mentioned, there are a few titles we could be hearing about, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven,</a> and the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Virtua Fighter Project</a>.</p>



<p>The summit will be where we'll hear all the announcements RGG Studio and SEGA have, with the RGG Direct following being where we'll hear more details about what was announced during the summit.</p>



<p>"<em>Providing fans with the latest updates from the studio, <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong> will take place on <strong>Wednesday, September 24 at 04:00 BST (</strong>Tuesday 23 September 20:00 PT). Following the conclusion of RGG Summit 2025, a <strong>new RGG Direct</strong> will also air, giving viewers a deeper dive into the newly announced information</em>," the company announced in a press release.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The RGG Direct will follow immediately after the RGG Summit. Image credit: RGG Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>It might be a long shot to hope for, but earlier this year we had some indication from SEGA that Stranger Than Heaven <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">won't be out until 2027</a>. Even if we don't get a proper release date, it would be good to have a release window that doesn't point to players having to wait the whole of next year before Stranger Than Heaven hits store shelves.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">recently got a look at</a> RGG Studio's Virtua Fighter Project, with proper gameplay being showcased for the first time earlier this month, but we've yet to have a more detailed deep dive into what RGG Studio is building in this game. Hopefully, we start to get those answers next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been confirmed for a series of upcoming PC games. One of them is Battlefield 6, though the recent beta already included the support, making this old news for those who already played the game. We do have a new trailer, anyway, which confirms DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex to be available when the game launches on October 10.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Friday, August 29, Ultizero Games will release the long-awaited action game Lost Soul Aside. Developed initially by lone creator Yang Ming, Lost Soul Aside has evolved over time and is now finally ready to launch. On PC, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, as well as Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray-traced shadows and reflections. According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will run the game up to five times faster when turning on all DLSS technologies. By the way, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment has not provided any pre-launch codes to press, so expect reviews to come in at a later time.</p>



<p>On the same day, NetEase's free-to-play MMORPG Sword of Justice (formerly known as Justice Online) will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Reflex, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. The latter will help greatly with the game's path tracing implementation. Sword of Justice is currently available in China, but a global release has already been confirmed to be on the way soon. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, the free-to-play action RPG game Wuthering Waves is adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The game already supported DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and ray traced reflections, but with Multi Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 50 Series owners can look forward to a 4.3x performance boost with ray tracing enabled and all graphics settings maxed out. As you can see in the performance chart below, the RTX 5090 gets almost 290 FPS, while the 5080 is at 225 FPS and the 5070 Ti at 205.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game adding Multi Frame Generation is the cooperative first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-has-officially-released-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>. Again, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but now those equipped with Blackwell GPUs will enjoy even faster frame rates.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, CCP Games added all main upscaling technologies (NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS, and MetalFX) to EVE Online. When it comes to DLSS, Super Resolution and Frame Generation are implemented, and Multi Frame Generation (as well as DLAA) can be toggled with the override in the NVIDIA app. EVE Online also looks better now, thanks to the newly introduced ray-traced shadows.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA has also released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.15) optimized for the Wuthering Waves update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC</a>, adding RTX Hair to the game.</p>
