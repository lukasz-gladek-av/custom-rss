			<p>Two days ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> showcase, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st has shared</a> a <strong>Fable leak</strong> featuring lots of concept art created by <strong>Playground Games</strong>. This is a great way to assess the game's visual style, if nothing else, as well as to preview some of the locations that players will find in the game during their explorations.</p>



<p>For example, one of the images shows a sign for <strong>Bloodstone</strong>. Those who played Fable II might remember that in that game, it was a modest-sized port town that harbored criminals and pirates. Geographically, it was surrounded by the deadly swamp, <strong>Wraithmarsh</strong>, to the north, east, and west, and by the ocean to the south, making it virtually isolated from the rest of <strong>Albion</strong>. </p>



<p>Besides Bloodstone, the concept art pictures are a mixture of scenic environmental shots of rolling hills and forests and creepy dungeon-like locations. </p>

<p>According to official info shared by Microsoft, the Xbox Developer Direct 2026 showcase, airing on Thursday, January 22 at 10 AM Pacific Time, <strong>will offer the first proper, in-depth look at the Fable reboot</strong>. Indeed, even the official X account of the game wrote:</p>



<p><em>We’ve been working on Fable for a really, really long time. It’s time to show you more. Much more. Tune in to Developer_Direct at 10 AM PT (6 PM GMT) on 22nd Jan for our first deep dive into the game.</em></p>



<p>The very first rumor that Playground, developer of Forza Horizon (also featured in its sixth incarnation in the showcase), would undertake the considerable effort of bringing back the fantasy action RPG series originally created by <strong>Lionhead</strong>, appeared in <strong>early 2018</strong>. It's therefore been at least <strong>eight years of waiting</strong> for fans, though it might not be long before they can actually play the game, given that it is scheduled to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X. According to VGC sources, Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might also launch on <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> at the same time</a>, though this remains unconfirmed. </p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> was easily one of the biggest releases in 2025. Despite only releasing at the end of October, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the year's<strong> best-selling games on Steam</strong></a>, and it helped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">digital storefront have its "<em>highest-grossing</em>" December yet</a>. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game on Google for the year</a>, and now, a new report from <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> shows the first indication that one of 2025's biggest games is in the running to be the biggest game in 2026.</p>



<p>If you've been following our gaming coverage in the last year, then you've almost definitely seen Circana and Piscatella mentioned before. Circana is a data analyst firm that tracks retail sales across multiple industries in the US, and Piscatella is one of their top analyst and an executive director, specifically covering the video game industry. Every month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">Piscatella reports the US sales numbers for the video game industry</a>, showcasing which titles made the charts that month, and in between those monthly reports, he's also started showcasing weekly player engagement numbers.</p>



<p>Today, ahead of his report for December 2025, which will also include the final sales charts for the best-selling game in the US in 2025, Piscatella reported that on Steam, ARC Raiders has led player engagement in the US <strong>for nine consecutive weeks<em>.</em></strong> These aren't concurrent numbers, just the total number of players per week.</p>







<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that it's still only January, and by the end of this week, ARC Raiders' impressive streak could be over, with it getting overtaken by the number two game, Counter-Strike. Even if the streak is broken, though, it's the latest sign that ARC Raiders is on an extreme hot streak at the moment, and there's no real indication it'll slow down anytime soon.</p>



<p>Since it launched, ARC Raiders has remained towards the top of the charts for global Steam concurrent player numbers. It hasn't <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">even dipped below <strong>250K concurrent players</strong></a> on Steam since<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/"> it soared past that mark when it arrived.</a> It has sold over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">12.4 million copies</a></strong>, and across all platforms, it reportedly hit close to <strong>1 million concurrent players</strong> this month.</p>



<p>Despite its developer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/"><strong>Embark Studios</strong>,</a> being consistently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy over its use of <strong>GenAI</strong></a>, the game has seemingly only picked up momentum. If it can continue this run, especially as new content is on its way from Embark, then there's little question as to what the biggest game of 2026 will be.</p>
