			<p>Fortnite OG has now launched as a separate game type for players to enjoy, and it comes with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">own game pass</a> as well, allowing players to get rewards that they can utilize in Fortnite OG. Within just 20 minutes of the game's release, it managed to get over<a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 1.1 million concurrent players</a>, with this statistic including the OG Zero Build game. This a huge deal for Fortnite, especially after they broke their record for most concurrent users just days before, with 14 million players playing Fortnite on November 30 for the Remix Finale event. Many gamers believe that Battle Royals, including Fortnite, aren't as popular as they used to be. However, Fortnite has seen some groundbreaking statistics for the genre, and the game saw 30 million active users a day during the entirety of 2024.</p>
<p>Fortnite first launched in 2017 and helped the Battle Royale genre skyrocket to new levels of popularity. This game was initially seen as an alternative to PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which was also launched that year. Compared to PUBG, Fortnite was entirely free-to-play, with the option to purchase cosmetic items such as skins and bling.</p>
<p>While there are many different reasons why Fortnite continues to remain popular today, a lot of it comes from the massive names they've seen collaborate with the game. The game has seen live events and concerts, such as those of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and even Ariana Grande. While these types of events do sound somewhat like a fever dream, they always have a massive turnaround and bring new players to the game.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Fortnite Remix Finale event took place on November 30, where performers such as Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Ice Spice participated. Snoop Dogg even provided a performance of "Another Part of Me (feat. Sting)" for the event. Admittedly, numbers did drop significantly after the event finished, but Fortnite continues to be incredibly popular, even after seven years of being active.</p>
<p>A lot of the popular events in the game revolve around the OG content, with a lot of the events being temporary maps that players can enjoy for a limited time. However, December 6 saw Fortnite OG be added to the game as a separate game type, now providing players with even more choices as to what experience they play in Fortnite.</p>
<p>Players who want to participate in Fortnite OG will get the choice between the original experience, which includes loot, locations, and features from the original experience. Alternatively, they can play OG Zero Build mode, which means players don't have to farm materials and build structures to survive.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA's weekly GeForce NOW Thursday update focuses on two classic PC games that just got remastered: The Thing and Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thing: Remastered</a> enhances 2002's third-person shooter game based on John Carpenter's seminal 1982 movie. Computer Artworks originally developed the game, but the remaster was handled by Nightdive, the studio behind so many excellent remasters (System Shock, Turok, Doom 64, Shadowman, Quake, Quake II, Star Wars: Dark Forces) and the recent full-fledged remake of System Shock. Once again, they delivered a great PC remaster that adds anti-aliasing, per-pixel lighting, 4K resolution and up to 144 frames per second. On GeForce NOW, Performance tier subscribers can play up to 1440p, while Ultimate tier subscribers can play at up to 4K and 120 frames per second.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521380/Legacy_of_Kain_Soul_Reaver_12_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a>, on the other hand, celebrates the franchise's 25th anniversary with a remaster of Raziel's classic tale of vampiric vengeance. The game originally developed by Crystal Dynamic has been remastered by Aspyr, another development studio well versed with remasters (but not with remakes, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), and it features cut-scenes rendered with higher fidelity models, brand new hero models for Raziel and Kain, new enemy and boss models, a new glow effect to Raziel's eyes and the Wraith Blade, real-time shadows applied to all characters and objects, a Day and Night cycle that was cut from the final version of the original game, a Photo Mode, and a brand new map and compass.</p>
<p>Of course, earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> also became playable via GeForce NOW wherever you have the license for it (Steam, Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass). GFN Ultimate subscribers can even enable the gorgeous path tracing that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added </a>on Monday with the first update.</p>
<p>The rest of the weekly GeForce NOW list includes the following additions to the cloud platform's library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Food Simulator (New release on Steam, Dec. 10)</li>
<li>The Spirit of the Samurai (New release on Steam, Dec. 12)</li>
<li>Diablo Immortal (Battle.net)</li>
<li>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria (Steam)</li>
</ul>
