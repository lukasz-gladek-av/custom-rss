			<p>A look at future Kojima Productions games will be provided later this month during the studio's 10th anniversary celebrations.</p>



<p>As revealed today on the Japanese development studio's <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand">official website</a>, a special event called Beyond The Strand will take place at TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Tokyo on September 23. The event will celebrate the development studio's 10th anniversary and feature special guest appearances as well as a glimpse into future projects. Tickets for the event will go on <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">sale</a> tomorrow, September 2, at 10:00 AM JST and will only be available via advanced reservation. Live stream details will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>Though we haven't seen much of what Kojima Productions is currently working on, we know the development studio headed by Hideo Kojima is working on the OD project with Microsoft and on Physint in collaboration with Sony. Following a slew of cancelled projects at Microsoft, the future of OD seemed uncertain, but it was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">confirmed</a> that development would continue on a project that will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">very different from anything else on the market and quite divisive</a>. Physint, on the other hand, seems to be very far from release, as the game that will bring back Hideo Kojima to the stealth genre is still in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/">conceptual phase.</a></p>



<p>Kojima Productions' latest game is Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Released in June on PlayStation 5, the second entry in the series is a much more cohesive package than its predecessor and the culmination of some of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Lords of the Fallen II developer and publisher CI Games has already shared the game's PC system requirements, even though it may well be several months—if not a full year—before it actually launches. The specs have been listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Epic Games Store page</a>, although they do not include any target resolution, frame rate, or graphics preset, making them quite vague.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>Memory: 12 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recommended Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i7 8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>
</ul>



<p>The store page also lists the languages in which the game will be subtitled: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Russian.</p>



<p>Like the previous game, Lords of the Fallen II will run on Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully, it will perform better than its predecessor did at its launch, taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UE5's latest improvements to combat stuttering</a>.</p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen II was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2025 with a cinematic trailer and the confirmation of the 2026 target release window. The game will take place several centuries after the previous installment, retaining the dual-world mechanics. The world of the dead, Umbral, is said to be encroaching on Axiom, the world of the living, and players will have to find a way to stop it from consuming all existence.</p>



<p>The developers also vowed to take into account the community's feedback for this sequel, implementing several highly requested features and improving the combat balance, as already glimpsed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lords of the Fallen version 2.0</a>. Overall, CI Games hopes for Lords of the Fallen II to pull off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “Empire Strikes Back” moment for the fantasy action RPG franchise</a>.</p>
