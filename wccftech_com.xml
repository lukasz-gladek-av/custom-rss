			<p>The journey to get here has been as long, challenging, and convoluted as many of Samus Aran’s own adventures. The last original release in the Metroid Prime series came out over 18 years ago, with the fourth entry in the series being announced in 2017 when the Switch was in its infancy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A complete development reboot</a>, which saw original series creators Retro Studios taking back control of the project, followed, and numerous delays got stacked on top of that, so it’s honestly hard to believe <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> launches this week. No, really. It’s happening.</p>



<p>Has the lengthy wait for Samus' latest adventure been worth it? Or is this series past its prime? Suit up and roll on for the answer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond opens in the midst of a chaotic attack on a Galactic Federation base orchestrated by the mysterious bounty hunter Sylux, who has harnessed Metroids to take control of his own Space Pirate crew. Of course, our trusty heroine Samus Aran steps in to kick some Space Pirate ass, but when a mysterious artifact is disturbed in the melee, she finds herself transported to an uncharted corner of the galaxy. And thus, Samus finds herself marooned on Viewros, a sprawling, beautiful planet once ruled by a technologically-advanced civilization known as the Lamorn. Samus must figure out why exactly she's been summoned to Viewros and how to get home. As an extra complication, Sylux has also been transported to this new world and is plotting trouble.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime410.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>However, Samus is also joined by some new allies. As anybody following the pre-launch coverage of Metroid Prime 4 has no doubt heard, the game has friendly NPCs – a quintet of Galactic Federation soldiers who pop up throughout Samus’ journey, eventually congregating at a home base and helping her through various missions. The reaction to the previews that first revealed the existence of these NPCs, particularly the nerdy, self-effacing engineer Myles MacKenzie, was... mixed, to say the least. Alarmist takes that Metroid — <em>Metroid, of all things!</em> — had been dealt a game-destroying dose of Whedonesque snark ran wild.</p>



<p>Well, I'm here to say, you can calm down<em>. It's okay</em>. While Myles comes on strong, the sequence that previewers reacted so negatively to literally lasts around 20 minutes. After that, Myles continues to be the guy you go to for certain upgrades, and he will chime in via radio from time to time, but he's much more subdued once he settles in. The rest of the Galactic Federation crew, while all a bit trope-ey, are generally less jokey and potentially annoying.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime411-1.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Don't get me wrong, I get the initial knee-jerk reaction. I <em>never</em> liked Buffy and tapped out on Marvel movies well before most people (how was Avengers: Endgame?). As somebody sensitive to cringe, let me assure you, Metroid Prime 4 is <em>not that cringe</em>. Samus is still a lone wolf for the large majority of the game, and hey, what's so wrong with her having friends for once? The only issue I have with Samus' new crew is that, at a certain point, the game asks that we actually care about them, and I never really did. They didn't annoy me terribly, they didn't ruin the game, I just found them forgettable for the most part.</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, "forgettable" is the best word to describe the Metroid Prime 4 plot. While some of the backstory of Viewros and the Lamorn is interesting, the game doesn't weave its various threads into a particularly satisfying whole. Of course, Metroid Prime games have always had relatively uninteresting stories, and nothing here descends to the dire storytelling lows of something like Metroid: Other M, but there was potential for something a bit more engaging here. What if, for instance, Samus had actually been allowed to have some back-and-forth interactions with her new crew (she's given the Nintendo silent protagonist treatment here)? What if this story felt more interconnected with previous Prime games or the larger Metroid mythos? Alas, these are mere pipe dreams.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime420.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>But again, this franchise has never really been about story, and on the gameplay front, Metroid Prime 4 delivers. If you've ever played a Metroid Prime game before, this entry feels pretty much identical — the silky-smooth movement, the surprisingly solid-feeling first-person platforming, the fun Morph Ball physics. This time around, there are more control options than ever, with players being able to make use of gyro aiming, flip their Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for well-implemented mouse controls, or go old-school with Gamecube-style lock-on aiming. <span>The newer control options aren't really&nbsp;<em>required;</em>&nbsp;the series is built around lock-on aiming, and that's largely what I used during my playthrough, but it's nice that those who want to play this game as a more traditional shooter have valid options.</span> Also lovely is Metroid Prime 4's impressive level of technical polish, offering both 4K/60fps and 1080p/120fps modes, with the former never dropping so much as a frame as far as I noticed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime412.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid fans will be familiar with most of the abilities Samus gains this time around, from the Space Jump to Super Missiles, with the main addition being the new "psychic powers." Most of these powers essentially complement existing abilities, with, for instance, Samus being able to move bombs she produces in Morph Ball mode with telekinesis or direct shots from her arm cannon to hit tricky switches. Psychic abilities don't radically alter that classic Metroid Prime gameplay, but they do open up some new level design avenues.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime413.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>And really, Metroid Prime 4's world and level design is where it truly shines. This game is all about scope. If most Metroid games to this point were obviously inspired by the claustrophobic feel of the early Alien movies, Metroid Prime 4 feels inspired by Ridley Scott's (underrated in my opinion) prequel, Prometheus. In contrast to past Metroid entries, this is a game about dramatic, imposing openness and size. You see that in the stark, rolling dunes of the game's desert hub as well as its various "dungeons," which are all grandiose in their own ways, offering up large-scale, immaculately-designed architecture set amongst beautiful skyboxes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime414.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, while it may not be designed for the strongest hardware on the market, Metroid Prime 4 is one of the most striking-looking games I've played in recent memory. Again, the focus here is more on bold, beautifully designed structures and open spaces rather than the cramped approach of past Metroids (although the game is often dark and atmospheric when it chooses to be). On Switch 2, this is easily the sharpest-looking game Nintendo has ever offered, with even the publisher's usual lack of anti-aliasing being much less obvious than usual.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime415.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The scope of Viewros is reinforced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-vi-o-la-motorcycle-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samus's bitchin' new motorbike, Vi-O-La</a>, which is fun and easy to control, whether you're cruising around the world's central desert area or the paths that connect different sections of some dungeons. There's also been a fair amount of concern about Metroid Prime 4's central desert, Sol Valley, with some worrying it’s a huge, all-encompassing open-world similar in scope to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Hyrule, but that's not really the case. Granted, Retro has borrowed somewhat from recent Zeldas, as Sol Valley is dotted with a handful of shrines to explore and other collectibles to find, but the reality is, you can drive from one edge of the desert to the other in maybe 2 or 3 minutes and can largely ignore it for much of Metroid Prime 4's runtime (although you shouldn't, for reasons I'll explain soon).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime416.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As good as Metroid Prime 4’s overall world design is, it’s in its traditional exploration-focused “dungeons” that it reaches its zenith. These parts of the game are perhaps the most fun and engaging Metroid Prime has ever been, and while each dungeon has a predictable elemental theme (fire, ice, electric, forest, etc.) they all have a unique secondary theme and often a backstory that defines them. For instance, the electric-themed dungeon is an automated factory where Vi-O-La bikes are manufactured and the ice area is actually a horror-tinged experimental bio lab where shadowy experiments were conducted.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime417.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Almost all the dungeons are designed in a "there and back again" format, with players pushing downward into their furthest depths, upon which, you usually battle a boss and the area transforms, resulting in a completely different experience as you try to extract yourself. And then, the dungeons often change again as you backtrack to them later.</p>



<p>Yes, classic Metroid backtracking is still very much a thing here. While the early hours of Metroid Prime 4 feel relatively on rails, around a third of the way in, the game really opens up, freeing the player to unravel how to progress through the rest of the game. There is a specific path you have to follow (although I'm sure clever folks will be able to sequence-break) and the game is refreshingly willing to let you find your own way. Myles will occasionally chime in over the radio to give you high-level pointers on what to do next, but it's up to you to figure out how exactly to get there, and once in dungeons, you're fully on your own.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime418.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During the middle stretch of Metroid Prime 4, as I was happily hacking through one intense, magnificent-looking dungeon after another and figuring out where to backtrack to next, I was fairly sure I was playing the Nintendo game of the year, and quite possibly the best Metroid Prime title to date. Unfortunately, Metroid Prime 4 does lose some of the momentum that it previously built so expertly in its last few hours. Retro doesn't outright fumble the ball, but it does kind of feel like they're running out the clock near the end.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime419.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Without giving too much away, Metroid Prime 4 makes a mistake that seems to be endemic to this series -- sending players on a last-minute scavenger hunt just when the game's story seems to be reaching its climax. This portion of the game is largely focused around Sol Valley, which is why I suggest you try to make some piecemeal progress there throughout the game, but even if you do, you're still looking at a fairly significant diversion just when you're eager to move full speed ahead. As for the climax itself, it’s solid, but compared to other big 2025 Nintendo games, it doesn't land the epic knockout blow that, say, Donkey Kong Bananza delivered.</p>



<p>That said, while Metroid Prime 4's final hours left me a bit flat, there's no diminishing how great the first three-quarters of the game are. Metroid Prime fans still have a mostly-tasty meal to look forward to, and the portions are generous. This is a solid 15-hour campaign and completionists could probably spend at least twice that time getting to 100 percent, so warm up your scanners.</p>

				<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. That said, those who have been waiting for this game for nearly two decades needn’t worry too much, as Metroid Prime 4 largely locks onto the core of what made this series great.</p>

			<p>ROUTINE has been a long time coming. Not that I would have known, or at least realized. Watching old trailers from its 2012 reveal didn't help me remember whether I had seen the trailer at the time (at first). In the decade-plus since Lunar Software put out its first trailers, I had entirely forgotten about them and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROUTINE's development</a> when I started playing through this new-old horror game.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I had a lot of questions when I started. First of which being 'what took so long.' According to Aaron Foster, ROUTINE's art director and project lead at Lunar Software, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first">IGN</a>, it was just personal reasons. They had to stop working on the game, and only came back to it in 2020, eight years after ROUTINE was one of the highlights of Gamescom 2012. </p>



<p>Lunar Software also essentially had to start from scratch. It couldn't exactly keep making the game in Unreal Engine 3 if it wanted to stand out on modern platforms. So the decade-plus since reveal isn't down to development hell, just regular life reasons, and then needing to essentially restart and overhaul the whole thing. Altogether, you'd probably be more accurate in saying ROUTINE took about six or seven years, instead of fifteen.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_007_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But anyone who does remember the 2012 Gamescom trailer has been waiting for fifteen years. So, has it been worth the wait? Well, I can't answer that question because even after eventually remembering that I did see the trailer when it first debuted, I haven't spent the last fifteen years wondering where ROUTINE is. So, from where I'm sitting, I'm just so goddamn glad we have another horror game shooting for, and frankly, nailing, all of the same targets Alien: Isolation was aiming for.</p>



<p>I'm not going to spend the entire review comparing ROUTINE to Alien: Isolation, but the comparison is, at least partially, unavoidable. Part of this comes from how both games strive for a retrofuturistic aesthetic, with ROUTINE showcasing the best VHS-era designs Lunar Software makes pass for technology capable of bringing you to the moon and maintaining a base there for years.</p>



<p>Besides some of the practical facts like both games forcing you to hide from all manner of enemies and both games featuring robots, what invites the comparison to Alien: Isolation is the unique ways in which Lunar Software builds a dense, rich atmosphere in ROUTINE. Little details like how you seamlessly transition from looking around to interacting with the many terminals you'll need to use to read the emails and diary entries that contain the core of the game's storytelling make the world feel all the more real.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_003_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or how the game takes the very old-school approach and gives you absolutely no help at all. No waypoints, no map markers; you can't even use the only tool you have in the game while crouched, which also means you can't use a flashlight. You're meant to slow down, to remember your limitations, and try to use your own common sense to solve the many, many puzzles that you'll have to work your way through across six chapters. </p>



<p>It's almost funny in a way that ROUTINE arrives over a decade later than it would have if Lunar Software didn't have to pause for personal reasons, and in that same year, Rouge Faction tries to front the same 'no hand-holding' philosophy for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>. And ROUTINE does it better in almost every way. I'd still say Hell is Us might be the better game overall, but there's a simplicity to ROUTINE that makes its environmental guidance work so well that I was never truly lost.</p>



<p>I'm getting ahead of things here. Backing up a bit, ROUTINE opens with you waking up on a lunar base to find that everyone is gone - or dead, and you have to figure out which it is if you don't want to end up the same way. Once you get yourself situated with how to bend down and grab something on the floor (a mechanic that is singled out in the early game and grossly underused afterwards), upon walking out your room door, you notice there are some pretty heavy-duty robots walking around.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_001_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Don't let the gun-like shape of your C.A.T. tool fool you; you can't actually take the robots down permanently; you can only stun them. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>These are Type-05s, or 'T5s' for short. You learn through the aforementioned emails, diary entries, and more than a few voice recordings found at key intervals that these robots used to help run the base, and now they've started killing all the humans in it for some mysterious reason.</p>



<p>I'm not going to get much deeper into the plot for spoiler reasons. Not because the plot is central to the core experience. Unfortunately, I found the general plot of the game difficult to follow, not just because of the disjointed way in which it was told, but because you're liable to take well over an hour in any given chapter, and because you can't go back and re-read/re-listen to the emails, diary entries, a voice notes that tell the story, it's easy to forget where you are in it.</p>



<p>It's especially easy to forget all the little lore details that are trying to clue you in on what's going on underneath the surface. It's all very interesting, and I'm looking forward to playing ROUTINE again to pay more attention to these aspects, but it's difficult to keep track of in a first playthrough, because you have to keep track of all the practical elements you see.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_002_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You begin to learn your way around the base and the few levels you get to see of it, since you'll be running around them enough times, hiding from your would-be killers at every corner. The constant game of hide-and-please-don't-seek-me in the circles you create in each area as you solve puzzles to unlock new elements of the environment actually felt a bit overwhelming at times. It can also create a frustrating loop where you can't figure out where to go next because you don't have time to look around and you don't have time to look around because you'll get caught and die if you're focusing on looking around and not hiding but if you want to survive you have to hide but then you're not looking around and not figuring out where to go etc.</p>



<p>But you only stay in that loop for as long as you allow yourself to. ROUTINE is balanced by the fact that anything looking for you will give up relatively easily if you hide, and while there are many robots to be found in the abandoned base, only one of them is active at a given time, so you're not just bombarded by enemies you can't kill. The second method feels cleverer than the first, especially because it's something you have to figure out based on the robot's actions, but both together get the job done, so no complaints there.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finding your way around is only one of the puzzles you'll constantly be asked to solve in ROUTINE. This game is filled with puzzles, but some of the smaller, more contained puzzles are far more interesting than their large-scale siblings, and most of those bigger puzzles that involve multiple steps are more about tedium than they are interesting puzzle-solving.</p>



<p>At least there's a lot going on as you run back and forth between terminals to try and unlock a specific door because, my goodness, this is such a thrilling horror game to play. ROUTINE is a tense game, for almost every second you're on the moon. It's a huge amount of emotional pressure to sustain for ten hours, but its unrelenting nature without being overly drawn out is what makes all ten of those hours the most tense you'll feel from a horror game in 2025.</p>



<p>As a horror fan, I can't help but feel electrified by just how terrifying ROUTINE is. Its jump scares are thoughtfully placed, its visual design is wonderfully retro, and I'd argue it's best enjoyed at a lower resolution than you'd play most modern games, almost made to look like you're playing a game off of a VHS.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_006_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What cinches it all, like any other classic horror game, is the soundtrack. DOOM, Prey, and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon and the rest of Lunar Software's audio team deserve all the credit in the world for creating an extremely terrifying soundscape. From the heavy thuds of T5s walking, to the ways their necks creak with sounds of old technology, not to mention the sounds they make while scanning their environment, and of course, the sounds they make during your death scene.</p>

				<p>ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/02/xbox-game-pass-december-2025/">announced the first batch</a> of Xbox Game Pass games heading to the service for the first half of December, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Lunar Software's ROUTINE headlining the games this month. And while most months are about the new games joining the service, December's lineup is also about games already on the service becoming available to players at the lower-level Premium and Essential tiers.</p>



<p>Starting with the new games, ROUTINE and Death Howl are the two titles entering the service this month that are day one releases into Xbox Game Pass. The former is a game that some people <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">have been waiting for over a decade for, after it was initially announced back in Gamescom 2012</a>. The latter is a Soulslike deck builder. </p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 is the big triple-A addition this month, though it's also a direct series trade, because as this game enters the service, Mortal Kombat 11 will exit the service as of December 15. You could even make the point that ROUTINE is another like-for-like trade, because while it joins the service, Still Wakes the Deep also exits on December 15.</p>



<p>As far as what's becoming available to more than just players paying for Game Pass Ultimate, the big headlining title is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Of course, it was already on Game Pass, but it was only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Now, it's available to players paying for the middle-tier Premium Game Pass subscription, along with 33 Immortals, which is still currently in a 'game preview' state on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, World War Z, Stellaris, and Medieval Dynasty are all now available at the base-level Essential Game Pass tier. Lastly, a small additional note on this month's Game Pass announcements is that Xbox has started to identify games that are optimized for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds</a> in these Xbox Wire posts. </p>



<p>It'll now list "<em>Handheld</em>" as an available platform for a game, which is a good indicator, even if in reality all of the games available on PC Game Pass are available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games for the first half of December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage - December 2 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>

<p>As far as what is leaving the service, as previously mentioned, Mortal Kombat 11 and Still Wakes the Deep will exit on December 15, along with Wildfrost. Following that, on December 31, Hell Let Loose and Carrion will also leave the service.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that this batch of games takes us all the way to December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">which is also the day of The Game Awards</a>. Perhaps that's because Xbox will be announcing and shadow-dropping a new title on Game Pass that day. We'll see how that develops.</p>
