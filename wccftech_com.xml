			<p>After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/">a great 2025</a></strong>, which saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/"><strong>return of the beloved <em>Silent Hill</em></strong></a> and the launch of several excellent horror games, <strong>2026 is poised to be a landmark year</strong>, and not only for the launch of the new entry of the series, which effectively established the survival-horror genre. With a popular horror franchise finally making its video game debut, and some welcome returns, <strong>2026 will be yet another year of frights</strong>.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong>five most anticipated horror games</strong> launching in 2026, alongside a few other titles worth mentioning that are launching in the coming 12 months.</p>

<p>From <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>, the twisted minds behind the first two <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ship-of-horrors/">Little Nightmares</a></em></strong> titles, comes <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong>, a spiritual successor to the series, sporting a new setting and a <strong>co-op focus</strong> that aims to make the experience more engaging.</p>



<p>This horror adventure follows a brother and sister on a harrowing journey through a <strong>hellish, grotesque landscape</strong> to rescue their missing friends. <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/"><strong>Retaining the signature "grotesque beauty" of Tarsier’s previous work</strong></a>, <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong> takes everything up to eleven in terms of scale and creature designs, offering an experience that promises to be as <strong>unnerving</strong> as it will be to play.</p>

<p>Although fairly niche compared to series like <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> and <strong><em>Silent Hill</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Fatal Frame</em></strong> franchise is widely appreciated by survival horror fans thanks to its <strong>marked Japanese feel</strong>. And in <strong>2026</strong>, both newcomers and veterans of the franchise will be able to experience the <strong>second entry in the series like never before</strong>.</p>



<p>Developed with involvement from <strong>Team NINJA</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>which is also launching <em>Nioh 3</em> this year</strong></a>), <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> brings the tragic story of twin sisters <strong>Mio and Mayu</strong> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake-release-date-march-2026-ps5/"><strong>modern hardware</strong></a> with <strong>improved visuals</strong>, <strong>overhauled lighting</strong> and <strong>new gameplay features</strong>, such as the <strong>"Hold Hands"</strong> mechanics that use the sisters' bond to restore health and spirit power, adding a <strong>tactile layer</strong> to the exploration of the cursed <strong>Minakami Village</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IllFonic</strong>, the masters of the asymmetric horror genre, have adapted <a href="https://wccftech.com/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-hands-on-preview-laugh-or-die/"><strong>countless horror franchises</strong></a> as video games, but all these games are set to pale in comparison to <em>Halloween: The Game.</em></p>

            <guid>1398559</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Are you looking forward to first-party PlayStation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>? Ever wanted a game to just play itself, while you put the controller down and just watch the trophies roll in? If you hear that and wonder, 'Well, what's the point of playing the game in the first place?' then you're having the same reaction to Sony's new 'AI-generated Ghost Player' patent that most of the internet seems to be having. If you think that sounds like a great way to enjoy a game, then this patent seems to be made specifically for you.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">published the filing publicly this week</a> after it was initially filed by Sony back in September 2024. The patent describes a "<em>ghost player</em>" appearing as an "<em>overlay</em>" to show the player how to complete a section of the game they're having trouble with. </p>



<p>"<em>During live gameplay by a player, game state data is analyzed in order to identify a scenario occurring in the context of the gameplay of the player. The scenario occurring during the live gameplay can then be processed by the Al model and an assistance Al engine in order to provide a ghost character with control inputs for animation/control to guiding the player in relevant interactivity of the game</em>," the filing reads. "<em>The relevant interactivity is for the context of the gameplay of the player, not just some prior gameplay of another player. The ghost character can therefore be controlled by the assistance Al engine during gameplay and provide the player with visual illustrations of how certain game scenarios are played in order for the character controlled by the player to be able to achieve progress in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sony-AI-Generated-Ghost-Player-Patent.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: WIPO</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The filing also describes different modes for players to pick from. The 'Guide Mode' would show you the solution to whatever is troubling you in the game you're playing, like a puzzle in Uncharted or God of War. Whereas 'Complete Mode' would just do it for you, so you can move progress further in the game and not have to deal with that section.</p>



<p>Sony already has help systems built into the PS5's console software, with its Tips and Game Help system that lets players get increasingly more detailed hints as to how they complete a section of the game, with the most detailed hint simply telling the player what they need to do. It only works when developers opt into including those hints, but when they're there, they can be helpful to players who don't want to reach for their phone or laptop to look up a guide.</p>



<p>Players already complain when NPC allies give you the answer to a puzzle before you've had the chance to solve it yourself. It doesn't sound like this AI-generated Ghost Player would jump the gun and show you a solution before you ask for one, but going as far as to beat the section for you seems like a stretch too far for anyone who actually wants to enjoy the games they buy.</p>



<p>Of course, it is just a patent, so we may never see this actually implemented. But based on the reaction players had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Microsoft's Gaming Copilot</a> introduction last year, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">even the idea that an AI is helping you and watching you play</a>, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing players want to have available to them.</p>



<p>You can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/">look up a handy guide</a>, or, of course, just try and figure it out for yourself. No one likes getting frustrated when playing a game, and getting stuck is not a good feeling. Sometimes that frustration is what makes you stop playing a game entirely. But where's the fun in watching the game play itself?</p>

			<p>The first batch of Xbox Game Pass games for 2026 <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/">has been revealed</a>, with a strong lineup of seven games joining the service, including Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, and three titles already included in the service at the Ultimate tier now available at the second-rung, Premium tier.</p>



<p>One user on ResetEra called this batch a "<em>damn good month</em>," and it's no surprise considering how many big names are included in the first dump of Game Pass games to start off 2026. It even has at least one day-one release with MIO: Memories in Orbit, a new metroidvania from publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Douze Dixièmes.</p>
