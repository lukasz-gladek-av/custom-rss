			<p>Today, Funcom has published a new exploration trailer for the upcoming massive multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. The video goes through the basic progression every character will have to go through after crash-landing on Arrakis: first, surviving, crafting a stillsuit, founding a home base, and making vehicles to roam the desert planet.</p>
<p>Eventually, players will venture to the biggest and most dangerous map, the Deep Desert. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> earlier by Game Director Joel Bylos, this huge map can house hundreds of players at once and is always PvP enabled.</p>
<p><em>The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>
<p>In today's trailer, Funcom also remarked that the Deep Desert map will reset every week, explained in-world by the massive Coriolis Storms, which will sweep over the map and change it. This also means Dune Awakening players will then get to explore as if it were new when it comes to its points of interest and resource nodes. It's even possible for explorer types of players to get in there just after the reset, survey the map, and then either share it with allies and clan members or sell it on the Exchange, the game's version of the traditional MMO-style auction house.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game will launch on PC in a little over two months. Its benchmark and character creator tool are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on Steam, though. For more details <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Dune Awakening</a>, check out our developer Q&amp;A from a recent press event.</p>

			<p>Lossless Scaling's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/">adaptive frame generation</a> is a great proof of concept that can deliver consistently smooth output with low base framerates even on mid-range system configurations.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a quick look at the new feature introduced to the upscaler earlier this month, highlighting how, even on a mid-range system powered by a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and an RTX 4060 GPU, the feature is capable of delivering consistently smooth 120 FPS output with low base framerates, high settings and even ray tracing at 1440p resolution in Control, and at native 4K resolution in Starfield. While the experience is far from perfect due to visual artifacts and the massive latency caused by the low base framerates, which is only partially alleviated by tech like NVIDIA Reflex, the new Lossless Scaling feature is an amazing proof of concept, also considering how it does not rely on any specific hardware technology.</p>

<p>Everything that Lossless Scaling offers is great for games that do not support upscalers from major vendors, but DLSS, FSR, and Intel XeSS will continue to be the better options for games with official support. AMD's upscaler, in particular, has made some impressive steps forward with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/">latest version</a>, delivering an image quality that is on par with the previous version of DLSS, which still retains the crown of the best upscaler currently available thanks to the introduction of the superior Transformer model which can deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">impressive image quality with lower input resolution</a> than the previous CNN model.</p>
