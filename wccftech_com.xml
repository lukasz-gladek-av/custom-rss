			<p>During the latest Letter from the Producer LIVE broadcast, the next patch for Final Fantasy XIV was revealed, with the <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch</a> being named Patch 7.2: Seekers of Eternity. In the broadcast, Producer and Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/">Naoki Yoshida</a> walked the audience through the additions that will be released with this patch, including a continuation of the Main Scenario Quests, a new Unreal Trial, and more. Below is an archive of the stream, but it is in Japanese only.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVQWDewBrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Letter from the Producer, Yoshida also mentioned upcoming content named Cosmic Exploration, which is a new activity coming to Final Fantasy XIV, which is designed for crafters and gatherers. You can team up with other players and explore uncharted stars together while gathering supplies that you may need. There are also new field operations named the Occult Crescent.</p>
<p>The Occult Crescent is a large-scale battle-oriented duty, where you have to explore unmapped terrain and explore a mysterious isle while having to battle against the inhabitants that live there as you try to uncover the isle's secrets.</p>
<p>This new patch for Final Fantasy XIV is set to bring something for everyone. Whether you're a player who solely does the MSQ or you also like to do some of the more challenging group content, everyone will be well-catered to. Speaking of group content, there will be a new dungeon added in this patch, named The Underkeep. The next tier of the Raid will also be released, called The Arcadion: Cruiserweight Tier. Recollection is the newest Trial to be added to the game, available on Normal and Extreme difficulty if you find yourself wanting a challenge.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Unreal Trial has been added, where you can revisit Hells' Kier and take on Suzaku, one of the Four Lords at level 100.</p>
<p>While there is a focus on adding new group content to Final Fantasy XIV, there will also be new Allied Society quests, where you'll be able to assist the Mamool Ja. There will also be new Hildibrand quests to take on if you find that you have completed all of the pre-existing ones in the game.</p>
<p>Series 8 of PvP will be beginning in this new patch, including several new actions for large-scale PvP encounters, as well as adjustments to the pre-existing actions. Frontline (Secure) makes a return to the PvP rotation, but this time it comes with some map improvements.</p>
<p>Before this patch goes live, a final minor patch will be released prior, which will be released on February 25. While there is no set date for the Seekers of Eternity patch, it was mentioned by Yoshida that it will be released some time in March.</p>

			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a paywalled report on what's next for Warner Bros. Games, and the article includes updates on the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>The historic development studio of games like Shogo, No One Lives Forever, The Matrix Online, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the two Middle-earth: Shadow titles announced the game during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2021. Over three years have passed since, though, and we haven't seen anything more than that teaser trailer, nor do we know anything concrete other than the fact it will be an origin story featuring the Nemesis system that Monolith Productions designed for its most recent games.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's sources, that is because the development of the Wonder Woman project has been troubled, leading to its reboot in early 2024 under a new director. The report also alleges that Warner Bros. Games already spent over $100 million on the game, which makes sense as it's been nearly eight years after the launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Despite all this time and resources spent on it, Wonder Woman is nowhere near ready and will still take years to be released, if that can even happen, according to the report.</p>
<p>This doesn't bode well for the publisher, which had to deal with several blunders after the explosive success of Hogwarts Legacy. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flopped</a>, and, as many had assumed, Schreier confirms Rocksteady is returning to its safe haven of making single player Batman games. However, a new game will take years to be developed. Then there's MultiVersus, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shutting down on May 30</a> after its fifth season.</p>
<p>All these problems led to Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad's <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent departure</a>. The publisher is now reportedly facing a 'thin' release schedule in the near future, as most of the next triple-A projects will take time to be crafted. For example, following the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is said to be helping on the Wonder Woman game while also putting together a pitch for a Game of Thrones game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-rumored-to-be-announced-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X might be announced very soon. The info was first shared by Rainbow Six Siege leaker<span>fraxiswinning</span>, who <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1887653415683035289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><em>Take everything with a large amount of salt when we talk about ‘Siege X’. Everything is speculative. Nothing is confirmed. </em><em>All we know is ‘Siege X exists’. We’ve been told by sources that it will be revealed at the SI. Things can change. </em></p>
<p><em>Seen some people say Siege X is CODENAMED Siege X. To clarify, It was originally named as ‘Modernized Siege’, traces of it popped up ~5 Months ago. It was renamed to ‘Siege X’ - 4 Months ago. Siege X is the final name.</em></p>
</div>
<p>According to the same source, this will be an engine overhaul and a graphical upgrade for textures and models, making it more of a remaster rather than a full-fledged sequel. Even so, it's been nearly ten years after the launch of Rainbow Six Siege, and a lot of fans have been clamoring for a technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The announcement is expected to happen next week, during the playoffs of the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/competition/468/14920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Invitational 2025 eSports tournament</a>. This is also where the developers will share other info, such as the new operator for Year 10 - Season 1. According to the leaker, the operator is from New Zealand, codenamed Curtain and named Rauora. The leaker also shared the codename for the operator that will be added with Year 10 - Season 3: Heist.&nbsp;Supposedly, Rainbow Six Siege X might launch during Year 10 - Season 2, which should be released in a few months.</p>
<p>As mentioned by the leaker, take the announcement info with a grain of salt, as publisher Ubisoft could always hold back the news until a later time. However, the veracity of the project itself seems to have been indirectly confirmed by Game Designer Justin Loranger-Ahluwalia, who <a href="https://x.com/trichotome/status/1887681661833277838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a long X thread against leaks, asking leakers to 'do something better with their lives' rather than what they've been doing so far.</p>
