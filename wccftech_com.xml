            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed the previous Battlefield 6 leaks for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10 with no early access options.</p>



<p>On PC, the pricing is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: $69.99 / €69.99 / GBP 59.99
<ul>
<li>Phantom Edition: $99.99 / €99.99 / GBP 89.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>On consoles, it is slightly higher for Europeans and British players:</p>



<ul>
<li>$69.99 / €79.99 / GBP 69.99
<ul>
<li>$99.99 / €109.99/ GBP 99.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The Open Beta details are slightly different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a>, though. There will be two beta weekends:</p>



<ul>
<li>Saturday, August 9 - Sunday, August 10</li>



<li>Thursday, August 14 - Sunday, August 17</li>
</ul>



<p>The press release also reveals plenty of details on Battlefield 6. The premise is that in 2027, a high-profile assassination throws the world into chaos. Around the same time, 'major European countries' leave NATO, while the United States and its remaining NATO allies are left to deal with a massive private military corporation called PAX ARMATA.</p>

<p>In the single player campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by Motive</a>, players step into the boots of Dagger 1-3, a squad of Marine Raiders fighting private military companies around the world to stop a global collapse. The developers promise 'jaw-dropping set pieces' and 'explosive action on an unparalleled scale'.</p>



<p>The game's combat system is described as 'kinesthetic', enhancing gunplay and character movement. It offers new tactical options, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drag and Revive - Lets you drag a teammate away from danger while reviving them</li>



<li>Peek and Lean - Lets you peek around corners to spy on the enemies while remaining unexposed to their fire</li>



<li>Combat rolls - A new maneuvering ability to limit fall damage and increase the chance to avoid getting hit</li>



<li>Mounting weapons - When behind cover, players can mount weapons to decrease recoil</li>



<li>Hitch ride - This feature expands how many players can be on vehicles beyond just seats</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers also promise that Battlefield 6 will offer 'reliable recoil patterns' and 'well-defined weapon ranges'. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The class system returns. That was practically a guarantee - even Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it back eventually</a>, although it was too little and too late. The classes are the same four fans have loved throughout the entire franchise: Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Support.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Assault class, unsurprisingly, uses assault rifles and has a faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from the weapons. It also takes less damage and a lower movement speed penalty from a fall. Its signature gadget is an Adrenaline Injector that clears flash and stun effects (and offers resistance against them), boosts sprint speed, reduces damage taken from explosives, and makes the sound of enemy footsteps clearer. Its active ability reveals audible nearby foes, and kills prolong this effect. Assault players can choose from two training options: a Grenadier (quicker reload on grenade launchers, extra grenades, and more resistance against flash effects) or a Frontliner (improved health regeneration, extra adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty to shooting on the move).</li>



<li>The Engineer uses submachine guns, has better hip-fire control, and takes reduced damage from explosives. Its gadget is the Repair Tool, which 'fixes friendly assets and armor' but can also damage enemy assets. Its active ability overloads the Repair Tool to improve its efficiency. The Engineer's training options are the Anti-Armor (who focuses on damaging enemy vehicles with faster loads, extra rockets, and its rockets diminish repair efficiency) and the Combat Engineer (who automatically regenerates the health of vehicles they occupy, can use the Repair Tool longer, and automatically spots mines).</li>



<li>The Recon uses sniper rifles, with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control. It can automatically spot enemies when aiming through an optic sight. Its gadget is the Motion Sensor that tracks any enemy movement in its range. Its active ability calls an UAV to passively spot enemies in a marked position. The Recon's training options are: Sniper (improved auto-spot speed, range, duration, and the sniper shots temporarily prevent healing and headshots make targets unrevivable) and Pathfinder (undetectable by equipment except when sprinting, they also highlight foes for the rest of the squad and can perform quieter takedowns).</li>



<li>Lastly, the Support fights with light machine guns and does not suffer any sprint speed penalty with this weapon. They can drag and revive squadmates faster and also carry a Supply Bag, which heals allies and resupplies both weapon and gadget ammunition. Their active ability is a supply area of effect around them that also temporarily increases their revive speed. The Support's Training Options are: Combat Medic (they function as a health dispensary for squadmates and regenerate health when reviving them) and Fire Support (they have improved weapon control from mounted weapons and can provide ammo to teammates).</li>
</ul>

<p>Battlefield 6 also brings tactical destruction back. Players can not only use rockets or tanks to blow things off, as even a sledgehammer or some C4 can take down a wall. The developers say that projectiles now leave a realistic impact based on the round and the wall's material, while explosives blow down walls based on their damage potential.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The game will launch with nine maps: Siege of Cairo, Empire State, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, Kundara Valley, and the remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. Multiplayer modes include classics like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, not to mention shooter staples like Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. The developers also added a brand new mode called Escalation where two teams fight to capture strategic control points.</p>



<p>Portal also returns with a robust toolset that has been improved with a spatial editor powered by Godot. A server browser will be a 'highlighted Community option' that is often available in Featured playlists. Furthermore, Portal-made experiences created in Verified Mode will allow for full progression in Battlefield 6. Lastly, the developers reassured fans that the ambitious post-launch support will deliver more maps, modes, weapons, and features on a regular basis. </p>

			<p>In proper explosive Battlefield fashion, a large group of content creators and influencers, as well as a select pool of journalists, were invited to get the first official hands-on with EA DICE’s upcoming large-scale military FPS: <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>. Fighting right alongside Stonemountain64 and TheBurntPeanut, we went deep into the multiplayer across a small offering of modes and maps that will be a part of Battlefield 6’s launch later this year.</p>



<p>During a group Q&amp;A session with questions taken from the pool of journalists and content creators, Battlefield 6 devs talked about how they wanted the destruction to feel chaotic yet not turn into chaos. While there’s a far greater emphasis on the destruction powered by the Frostbite Engine, the intent is to make the action feel deterministic. When free-aiming a rocket launcher into an apartment building, the destruction should look as you expect, with a hole being ripped through the architecture rather than bringing the entire building down. This could be EA DICE’s way of keeping the hardcore tournament players from feeling alienated with a destruction system that feels seemingly without order while still maintaining the spectacle that casual players will relish in the destruction in every match.</p>



<p>Movement in Battlefield 6 is much more than just boots on the ground. Dubbed the Kinesthetic Combat System, there’s a variety of new traversal mechanics to keep the flow of the match feeling dynamic without falling into the same routine sprinting and peeking around corners. For starters, players can now grab hold of a downed teammate and drag them to safety while reviving them, hopefully breaking the cycle of a well-placed sniper that’s just waiting to pick off enemy tickets. Weapons can also be mounted on low barricades or even up against walls with the right attachments, something that made my time trying to play a long-range Support class and snipe with an LMG a bit more manageable. The tactical approach to Battlefield 6 feels like a refreshing take on the series after Battlefield 2042’s run-and-gun focus took much away from the series’ signature feel. One other charming new addition that I couldn’t see for myself but was teased in the multiplayer reveal was the addition of multiple new mount points on vehicles, allowing players to hitch a ride on the outside of an armored vehicle for a lift from HQ onwards to the next objective.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6’s gunplay initially feels like there’s a significant advantage to playing on keyboard and mouse versus what I had done with being the odd man out and playing the preview event on PlayStation 5 Pro on controller (there does appear to be keyboard and mouse support available in the menus, however). The LMG that I was a fan of running on Medic/Support since the days of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam offered upgrades to turn it into a semi-auto rifle for longer-ranged incursions; trying to do the same in full-auto even with controlled bursts kicked the gun around so violently that it would be difficult to get a bead on an enemy soldier even if they’re standing perfectly still at 50 yards away. In much more intimate settings, it was the SMGs with a high rate of fire and the Assault’s signature shotgun that stole the show. The TTK (Time to Kill) felt varied enough on the different modes depending on the type of engagement you were getting into, but any of the small-scale maps came down to whoever could pull the trigger first, and gunfights barely lasted a fraction of a second.</p>



<p>In oh-so-many of our multiplayer matches during the four-hour run of the show, grenades and rocket launchers littered the landscape and leveled many a building face, opening up new vantage points while destroying cover that an enemy sniper might’ve been using to take pop shots at your squad. Nowhere in these claustrophobic maps felt safe, and it was even more evident in the larger mountain pass levels where only a few single or two-story buildings are all the cover you might get from tank fire. Matches showed the scars of war in such a short time, and even those faster-paced fifteen-minute matches left nothing but a wake of destruction and body counts in the dozens.</p>



<p>While Battlefield has relished in the massive maps where 64 players could test their mettle against one another, there’s a balanced emphasis in the multiplayer reveal event for much more intimate matches with only sixteen players racing for the most kills in a short time. These maps are smaller sections of the main offerings carved up and transformed into a tiny combat arena, often without room for vehicles. Some fans have been asking for EA to introduce blitz modes and Team Deathmatch for ages, and this is the way for Battlefield to answer the wishes of its most vocal fanbase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Perhaps the other most welcome change for Battlefield 6 is the return of the classic Class System: Assault, Recon, Support, and Engineer. No more operators, no more hoops to jump through to get the skills you actually want to use. Building a class is a combination of selecting a primary and secondary weapon, passive and active class abilities, and throwable and deployable gadgets. Each of the four classes only had a small number of selections to choose from for class customization in the preview event, often only two or three options per primary and a single pistol type. For the Support class, this meant having a deployable ammo box that would also facilitate faster regeneration, while the Assault class got a grenade launcher that could launch either thermobaric or explosive ordinance. For the most intimate close quarters maps, Assault has probably the best skill set as they can also bring along a third weapon, whether it’s a shotgun or second primary weapon (and for smaller maps, you would be a fool not to pick up the shotgun as it’s currently in its most overpowered version with melting any soldier in one, if not two well placed shots (I wish I could’ve sampled trying to snipe with it using a 4.0x scope and slug rounds but that’s something I’m saving for the proper open beta).</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I’ve experienced during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can’t come soon enough. We only went hands-on with four maps during our preview, but there will be an additional five maps coming at launch from Gibraltar and Manhattan to the title’s largest map, Kundara Valley, and even the return of Battlefield 3’s Operation Firestorm.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 will be a culmination project across four Electronic Arts studios: DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect (formerly DICE LA). When it launches on October 10th, players can get their hands on Battlefield 6 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC (Epic Games Store, EA App, and Steam); a Nintendo Switch 2 version will not be available at launch as Electronic Arts stated they do not have any current plans to release Battlefield 6 on Nintendo’s latest platform.</p>
