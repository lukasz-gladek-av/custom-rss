			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dying-light-the-beast-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-tracing-nvidia-reflex/">confirmed</a> the games getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, DLSS Super Resolution, NVIDIA Reflex and Ray Tracing tech, with Dying Light: The Beast and Gears of War: Reloaded headlining today's additions.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches today, after Techland moved the release date up from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">September 19 launch to today, September 18,</a> and its arriving with full support for a suite of NVIDIA technologies. On top of the aforementioned DLSS 4 Multi-Frame gen, it's also arriving with support for NVIDIA Reflex, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA. NVIDIA claims that players on RTX 50 Series graphics cards can enjoy frame rates multiplied by 7.6X on average with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution enabled while playing the game at 4K.</p>



<p>While 1440p players can enjoy a 5X performance boost if they've got an RTX 5090 in their desktop, making it possible to run the game at "<em>over 400 frames per second</em>." If you don't have a 5090 but you do have an RTX 50 Series card, you can still get the game running at 200+ frames per second, according to NVIDIA, with max settings and ray-tracing enabled.</p>



<p>Dying Light isn't the only game getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, as Mistfall Hunter enters into its closed beta with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support. It's also joined by Farming Simulator 25, which players can update today to see DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support go live.</p>



<p>Lastly, Jump Space, a new PvE co-op action game launching into early access tomorrow on September 19 will arrive with support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution, and Gears of War: Reloaded is getting an update today to support DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. </p>



<p>The last big batch of games that got support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 and DLSS Super Resolution included the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">Order of Giants DLC from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

					</p></div><div>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Sonic may not need a car to get around, but a hedgehog has to rest his feet from time to time, and Sega's mascot has amassed a fairly hearty collection of racing games over the years. While most of these racers have struggled to escape the shadow of a certain mustachioed rival's racing efforts, a few have managed to stand on their own and carve out respectable fanbases. Now, only a few months after the big release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the blue guy is also hitting the asphalt again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>



<p>Is this one of Sonic's more successful turns behind the wheel? Or is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds an easy one to cross off your list? Read on to get up to speed...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds mostly sticks to the modern mascot-racer formula, with vehicles that seamlessly transform whether they're on land, water, or in the air, a large collection of different items to frustrate your opponents with, and a focus on earning boosts by drifting around corners and doing tricks.</p>



<p>Past Sonic kart racers differentiated themselves a bit by offering somewhat more realistic driving physics, but that largely goes out the window with CrossWorlds. This game’s vehicles don’t feel like they have much weight or momentum as you take corners, with even Mario Kart's vehicles feeling like they have more inertia. To be clear, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's controls are perfectly responsive; they're just very arcade-y and can take some time to get used to. Thankfully, the game still delivers a proper Sonic-like sense of speed, with even races played on standard middle-of-the-road speed settings feeling pretty peppy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players also have some new freedom to customize their rides and abilities (yes, characters and vehicles are now chosen separately). Prior to races, players can mix and match vehicle parts and a variety of "gadgets" that offer an array of buffs. The latter goes deeper than the former, as there are a fairly limited number of vehicle parts, but around 70 gadgets that can alter your racing experience in sometimes rather novel ways.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's array of items are very derivative of recent Mario Karts -- the red and green boxing gloves are just Red and Green Shells, the Blue Wisp is a Mushroom, the drill-like Yellow Wisp is a Bullet Bill, and so on. But hey, Mario Kart's items are generally pretty fun and well-balanced, so, by extension, this game's items are also pretty fun and well-balanced. While you will get those occasional moments when a sure victory is snatched away mere feet from the finish line, I didn't find CrossWorld’s weapons too overbearing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much like Mario Kart World before it, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is somewhat fixated on changing the way individual races and Grand Prix cups are constructed. After completing the first lap of a race, whoever is in first chooses between two Travel Ring portals, upon which all racers jump to a CrossWorld track with a totally different theme for the second lap. Sometimes, these CrossWorlds will even have a Frenzy modifier attached, which may make the lap more difficult, or simply more intense, by doing things like flooding the course with warp rings. For the third lap, you return to your original course, although you’ll find it's now been modified with new hazards, shortcuts, and other changes. Each Grand Prix offers three unique courses, with the fourth race consisting of a single lap from the previous three races smashed together.</p>



<p>The CrossWorld gimmick is a neat-enough trick (albeit one that’s pretty much directly lifted from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) and it does introduce some unpredictability to races. That said, while there are 24 regular tracks in the game, there are only 15 CrossWorlds, and in my experience, certain ones came up more often than others to the point they become a bit over-familiar.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of over-familiar, there’s no getting around the fact that Sonic Team was doing some heavy cribbing from Nintendo, particularly Mario Kart 8, when designing this game’s courses. While Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's tracks are perhaps a bit narrower, their loopy, gravity-defying designs are <em>very</em> Mario Kart 8, and many of the themes feel almost directly copy-pasted — here's the treetop track, here's the spooky track, here's the dinosaur track, and so on. It's honestly a bit shameless and makes Sega's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">revive their old "Genesis does what Nintendon't" era marketing tactics</a> for CrossWorlds a bit questionable. More like Sega does what Nintendid a decade ago, amirite?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>‎That said, all snark aside, while they're a bit obvious in their inspiration, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's courses aren't <em>bad</em>. Quite the opposite, really. Mario Kart 8 is a great game, so it's a good source to take notes from. CrossWorld's tracks are intense, sometimes trippy, and fairly visually impressive (a move to Unreal Engine 5 mostly pays off, with only occasional stutters when approaching Travel Rings on PS5). In fact, I’d wager some of the folks disappointed by the more open and breezy approach of Mario Kart World may appreciate these Mario-Kart-8-flavored courses, particularly when combined with CrossWorld’s amped-up sense of speed. Ironically, Sega is offering an alternative to Nintendo by cribbing from Nintendo's own past.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, while Sonic keeps pace with Mario pretty well when it comes to on-road action, CrossWorlds lags behind pretty badly when it comes to content and ways to play. Unlike many earlier Sonic racers, there's no story mode here, with Grand Prix being pretty much your only single-player option. With only 8 cups available at launch, you'll be able to see most of what Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has to offer within 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are different speed classes, difficulty levels, time trials, mirror tracks, and a roster of rivals to best, but it all comes down to replaying CrossWorld’s somewhat modest collection of tracks and Grand Prix cups over and over. The Race Park multiplayer mode allows teams of players to tackle races with various extra objectives attached (collect the most coins, etc.) but this is just more somewhat transparent remixing of the same limited content.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>More Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds racers, vehicles, and courses are coming, but almost all of it, particularly the crossover content featuring the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants and others, is locked behind a $20 season pass. Of course, racing game season passes are nothing new, but it's hard not to be a bit put off given how quickly the core game races to the finish line.</p>

					<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</p>

			<p>The Complete RT shader and a selection of other visual improvements make Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater look stunning, making its visual more realistic and its lighting closer to path tracing quality.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, known modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer">MassiHancer</a> showcased the remake of the third entry in the series by KONAMI released last month on PC and consoles running with the Complete RT shader and ReSTIR G.I., which deliver path tracing quality with enhanced global illumination, ambient occlusion, tessellation, color grading and depth of field. The video also includes a few comparisons that highlight the significant improvements introduced to the game by the shader over the game's native Lumen.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the game suffers from performance and stability issues that are being addressed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">post-launch updates</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a solid remake of one of the best entries in the series created by Hideo Kojima. The faithful recreation of what is, still today, one of the finest stealth games ever released, and the addition of Legacy Style for purists and New Style for newcomers makes this remake a solid purchase for all sorts of players, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/"> review.</a></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
