            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has released a major STALKER 2 patch, updating the game to version 1.7. The new version introduces the long-awaited 'turf wars' between factions, powered by the A-Life System, which was initially lacking and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being restored to its original vision one patch at a time</a>.</p>



<p>Now, factions can expand their control over new territories but may also lose control of their own lands if they fail to defend them. Various points of interest, checkpoints, and locations (but not hubs, to avoid disrupting missions) are contested by different NPCs and mutants, who also seek to defend their lairs and territories from their hostile neighbors, the titular Stalkers. Other AI improvements have made stealth in STALKER 2 more realistic and less frustrating, because NPCs won't easily spot players who successfully hide in reeds or tall grass, and even when they do, they'll be less accurate when shooting at bushes. On the other hand, human and creature NPCs have learned the art of tactical retreat if the fight isn't going their way, and they are also smarter when it comes to choosing the distance when fighting.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Update 1.7 also introduces a new Master difficulty level, which can only be selected at the beginning of the game, and Expedition mode, which limits autosaves to when exiting camp and during specific missions, and locks players out of manual saving, except for saving to exit the game. Both are designed to increase the tension players feel while roaming the Zone.</p>



<p>STALKER 2's new patch features new anomalies, a rework of the stamina and sprint system (another source of frustration in the launch version of the game, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as noted in my review</a>), an update to inventory and equipment stats, some improvements to the controller experience, and a new light rain weather scenario. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full changelog</a> also lists a ton of bug fixes.</p>



<p>The game is currently 30% off on Steam. The PlayStation 5 version <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to launch in just two days</a>.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly testing the possibility of bringing Grand Theft Auto VI to the Nintendo Switch 2, according to a reliable leaker.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, well-known leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">Nate the Hate</a>, who has proved to be extremely reliable in the past, commented on rumors saying that the next entry in the series is coming to Nintendo's current generation console, saying that an effort has been made by Rockstar Games to see if they can bring the game to the platform. The current state of this effort, however, remains unknown.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don't always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don't know the current state of that effort.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Rockstar Games exploring if Grand Theft Auto VI could be launched on Nintendo Switch 2, however, is not a guarantee that the game will indeed launch on the platform. In a second message, Nate the Hate added that experimenting doesn't mean the game is in development, as this is a standard procedure among developers to determine if a game is possible on any given platform.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experimenting doesn't equal "in development" &amp; companies often test to see if a game is possible on hardware.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990546725535429023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Given the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">limited footage of Grand Theft Auto VI in action</a>, it is challenging to gauge how much it will push the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The two trailers released so far, however, suggest <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">the game will only target 30 FPS on both systems</a>, which would be a strong indication of how the new entry in the series could be pushing current-generation systems to their limits. With the game reportedly being <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/">so ambitious that it will be unmatched by other titles for decades</a>, featuring <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">advanced simulation systems </a>that would be very taxing on the system's weak CPU, and the use of ray tracing, the outlook for a Nintendo Switch 2 port is looking dire.</p>



<p>Still, while the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't as powerful as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, the system does have a few aces up its sleeve. The system has more available RAM than the Xbox Series S, which would definitely help Rockstar Games port over the Xbox Series S version, albeit with the obvious downgrades it will have compared to the other versions of the game. And most importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS, which has already been utilized effectively in games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">Street Fighter 6</a> to deliver exceptional experiences. </p>



<p>Given the complexity of all open-world games and what seems an already-strained performance on current-gen systems, a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Grand Theft Auto VI would undoubtedly be a challenging, yet potentially impressive, technical achievement. We will have to wait until late 2026 for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">the game's initial release</a> to see if a port is truly feasible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The massive Battlefield 6 1.2.2.0 title update has gone live today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, introducing new content and over 160 fixes, including the restoration of Aim Assist to its popular Open Beta tuning.</p>



<p>The new title update marks the beginning of the second phase of the game's first season, with the introduction of the new Eastwood map, a map with a South California theme whose variations are available for all official modes. </p>



<p>The new map is accompanied by new weapons - the DB-12 Shotgun and M357 Trait Sidearm - and support for a new feature called Battle Pickups. This feature will provide players with powerful weapons in specific experiences that offer limited ammo but massive firepower when it becomes available shortly.</p>



<p>Besides introducing new content, the new Battlefield 6 title update also brings some significant changes to Aim Assist, resetting it back to its Open Beta tuning. The changes made to the feature for the final version of the game were among the most controversial, so it being back to the Open Beta state will make more than a few players happy.</p>



<p>The changes to Aim Assist are only one of the over 160 changes featured in the new Battlefield 6 title update, which also include improved input latency and stick response for controllers, weapon accuracy tuning, major polishing for select gadgets, vehicles, maps, and modes fixes, and more. You can learn more about every change the new title update brings in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-2-0">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, and it's a definite improvement over its immediate predecessors. Check out <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review</a> to learn more about this strong return to form for the series.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/take-two-head-gaming-moving-toward-pc-console-experience-stick-around/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-head-says-gaming-is-moving-toward-pcs-although-console-experience-will-stick-around.1356553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Strauss Zelnick, who has been the CEO, chairman, and largest stakeholder of Take-Two since 2007, appeared yesterday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Squawk Box</a>, CNBC's business news program that airs weekdays from 6 to 9 AM Eastern Time.</p>



<p>During the conversation, the veteran executive of what will soon be the largest independent American publisher (once the Electronic Arts leveraged buyout goes through) said that the gaming industry is moving toward PCs and more generally toward open ecosystems, although the console experience isn't really going away.</p>



<p><em>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed. But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</em></p>



<p>The Take-Two executive isn't wrong. The console market has long stagnated, and its three big players, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, are only really stealing each other's customers rather than gaining new ones. On the other hand, PC gaming continues to grow, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam's record-breaking sales</a>. Moreover, new PC-based devices with a handheld or home console format, such as the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Steam Machine</a>, are being produced, thus potentially stealing market share from regular console manufacturers.</p>



<p>For its part, Microsoft is also shifting the way it thinks about consoles. While Xbox president Sarah Bond has just reiterated that the Xbox experience starts with the traditional console, rumors point to the next-generation hardware being a sort of console-PC hybrid that might also offer access to a Windows desktop environment.</p>



<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a slight hint late last month</a> at the company innovating in that space:</p>



<p><em>We also want to do innovative work on the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward.</em></p>

			<p>The game Silent Hill Townfall may be launching in just four months, according to a Mexican retailer. The store in question is called Liverpool Mexico, and no, that's not a mistake: it's a chain of department stores founded in 1847 by Jean Baptiste Ebrard. Originally, most of its goods were imported from Liverpool to Mexico, hence the name.</p>



<p>Anyway, as <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by the Polish website CD Action</a>, the store briefly listed the game for March 26, 2026. That's certainly not an usual placeholder date, which made fans suspicious. After the news started circulating on the Web, the retailer quickly <a href="https://www.liverpool.com.mx/tienda/pdp/silent-hill-townfall-estandar-para-ps5/1185330351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the listing</a>, prompting speculation that the game publisher (Annapurna Interactive) had reached out to ensure the information wouldn't spread ahead of time.</p>



<p>The most likely scenario is that Liverpool Mexico jumped the gun on publishing the game page before it actually received the green light from the proper channels. When it comes to the timeline, the launch date makes sense. Silent Hill Townfall was one of the games that KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in October 2022 to confirm the revival of the beloved survival horror franchise. </p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f have since been released, both receiving praise in their own rights. Townfall is arguably the most risky project, though, since it's a spin-off in development at a studio (Screen Burn, formerly known as No Code) that only ever made adventure games. Nothing has been shared yet; fans were even worried about a potential cancellation last year following Annapurna Interactive's issues, but the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Townfall was still in development.</p>



<p>If the game is really this close to launch, we should probably get official news very soon, probably by the end of the year, with Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards event being the most likely venue for such an announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sarah Bond, who was promoted to the role of Xbox president nearly two years ago, has been featured in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Fortune Magazine</a>. After a brief introduction about her earlier career outside the games industry (she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company and later at T-Mobile), the conversation switched to her passion for gaming and her work at Microsoft.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked where hardware fits within Xbox's new multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything-is-an-Xbox</a> strategy, and Bond said everything starts with the console, adding that the next one will deliver a 'powerful experience'. This aligns with rumors suggesting that the next Xbox hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 6</a>.</p>



<p><em>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience, and so that is why we are working on our next generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that's what's really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud. And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console, but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</em></p>



<p>Not too long ago, rumors surfaced that Microsoft might be abandoning the console business altogether, following the dwindling sales of the current generation Xbox Series S and X hardware, but Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in to confirm</a> that Microsoft is indeed still planning to produce new hardware in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, many gamers at this point wonder what the point is now that all Xbox games are available elsewhere, such as PC, mobile, and even previously rival console platforms. Brand fans used to answer that even without exclusives, Game Pass was too good a deal to pass on. That was true for a long time, but perhaps no more following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial price hike (+50%) for the Ultimate tier</a>, which is now the only one to guarantee access to all first-party games, including the new Call of Duty, on day one.</p>



<p>In the chat with Fortune Magazine, Sarah Bond also briefly talked about Game Pass, clarifying that Xbox's approach is wider than simply reproducing Netflix in the gaming space:</p>



<p><em>People have said that, and I think it's that, but I also think it's more than that. We support every business model. So if you want to subscribe and get access to your library games, you can absolutely do that. If you want to buy your games and build up your own library, you can also do that. It's really about actually giving as much access and choice to people, to not locking into any one model, but letting people actually pick the way they want to consume their games, and also letting developers choose pick the way that they want to monetize their games and reach the most users.</em></p>

			<p>Five months ago, Hypixel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio was shutting down, which also meant the end of the long-awaited game project Hytale. Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the developer and the project in April 2020 and reportedly requested a change in game engine, which caused numerous problems.</p>



<p>Now, however, Simon "Hypixel" Collins-Laflamme has surprised fans with the news that he has regained the rights from Riot Games and that Hytale will return to its original 'Legacy' engine and vision. The reason for that, according to Collins-Laflamme, is that the new 'Cross-platform' engine is significantly behind when it comes to gameplay features and would take at least two years to get to the same point as the original engine. This made the decision for the studio, which, however, still plans to make the Legacy engine cross-platform compatible at a later time, thus opening up compatibility beyond PC.</p>



<p>For now, Collins-Laflamme has already rehired over thirty developers from the Hypixel team, with more expected to return soon. The early access date will be announced soon and is likely to be relatively close, although the creator has warned that it will be a true early access release, with crashes, bugs, and broken features to be expected. It will be a long road to version 1.0, too, estimated to be 'at least a few years' away.</p>



<p>In its current state, Hytale already features over 100 NPCs and thousands of items and blocks, but many of these are not yet properly configured. The Adventure Mode won't be ready at the early access launch, and the same goes for the official minigames. The team is aware that these were an important part of the original Hytale vision, but the infrastructure and minigames are not yet ready. However, they have a dedicated team that will focus on implementing minigames once the core game is stable.  In the meantime, the community can start creating their own minigames, custom servers, and experiences. When the official minigames go live, their assets will also be shared, allowing the community to develop their own versions. </p>



<p>Indeed, Hytale will be all about modding from the very beginning. Collins-Flamme says it is possible to mod almost everything, both content and server-side, and claims that even non-developers can create impressive experiences with minimal technical knowledge. The development team promised to share server source code access within several months, allowing users to create their own custom servers, maps, adventures, and more.</p>
