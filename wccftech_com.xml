			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>2025 has been a great year for role-playing games</strong></a>, and 2026 is setting out to be another incredible year for one of the most popular gaming genres around. While next year won't see the release of many new properties, 2026 will see the <strong>return of some beloved series</strong>, with new entries in their respective franchises as well as <strong>remakes that breathe new life</strong> in all time classics.</p>



<p>Here are the <strong>five RPGs</strong> officially confirmed for a 2026 launch that we feel deserve your attention the most at this point in time.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5">Nioh 3 (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nioh-3.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>With its open-field mechanics and tight combat, Nioh 3 is one of the most anticipated RPGs launching in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Following games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rise of the Ronin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Team NINJA</strong>&nbsp;is finally returning to the series that has defined the studio's course since 2017: the&nbsp;<strong>Nioh series</strong>.</span></p>



<p>Unlike <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2</a></strong></em>, which refined the formula of its predecessor, bringing it to heights that made it rival FromSoftware games in terms of mechanical complexity, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> is set to provide a brand new experience with the introduction of <strong>open-fields</strong> that will provide a more involving way of engaging with the game's world inspired by different time periods in Japan, including the <strong>Sengoku and Bakumatsu eras</strong>.</p>



<p>This open-field approach, however, won't water down the mechanics that define the Nioh series. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">With the introduction of&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">two fighting styles - Samurai and Ninja - </strong>new mechanics inspired by other games developed by the studio, and a challenging, uncompromising experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;is set to become one of the&nbsp;best games by Team NINJA, if not the very best.</a></strong></span></p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-february-5-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will bring the seventh entry in the series to a whole new audience in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-new-information/"><strong><em>Dragon Quest XII</em> is nowhere to be seen</strong></a>, the popular JRPG franchise hasn't been dormant. Over the past couple of years, the first three entries in the series received excellent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">HD-2D makeovers</a></strong>, which will be followed this year by a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">full-on remake of Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Although the seventh entry in the series was already remade on Nintendo 3DS, <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> is set to become the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"><strong>overhauling everything from visuals to gameplay.</strong></a> With its <strong>beautiful handcrafted artstyle and diorama environments</strong>, a streamlined story experience which aims at <strong>trimming the original's very long story</strong>, new scenarios focused on the Hero, Maribel and Keifer, an <strong>improved Vocations system</strong> with the ability to equip two Vocations per character, new spells and skills for an enhanced battle experience, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> promises to deliver the <strong>prime turn-based JRPG experience in 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to make the long wait for <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> more bearable? We will find out this February.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In early 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that former <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> director <strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong> had founded a new studio called <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. Later that year, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>NetEase</strong> had provided an investment to create a new <strong>triple-A RPG</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to be titled <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>. Their game is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being published</a> by <strong>Bandai Namco</strong>, though, which is why NetEase's move to pull back from many Western studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not affect Rebel Wolves</a>.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker clearly borrows a lot from the framework of The Witcher III (which is only a great thing, as that is one of the finest open world RPGs ever made), but it also adds a few key innovations, such as the fact that there is essentially no difference between main and side quests. The protagonist, Coen, <strong>has 30 days to save his family</strong>; how to reach that goal is entirely up to the player. Tackling specific objectives is radically different during the day, when Coen is human, and at nighttime, when his vampiric abilities manifest. Because of these elements, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-freedom-closer-to-fallout-1-2-pen-paper-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> its role-playing freedom was <strong>inspired by pen-and-paper games</strong>.</p>



<p>Its setting and peculiar twist on vampire lore, with them actually coming out in the open and ruling the Carpathians-inspired Vale Sangora, is also intriguing. For more on The Blood of Dawnwalker, check out <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our exclusive interview with Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</a></strong> from Gamescom 2025.  </p>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">CONTROL Resonant (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CONTROL Resonant is a major shake-up of its predecessor's formula that will deliver Remedy Entertainment's most ambitious experience to date</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/"><strong>a brilliant action-adventure title</strong></a>, <strong>Remedy</strong> is taking a <strong>"not-so-safe" approach</strong> for the sequel. <strong>CONTROL Resonant</strong> officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/"><strong>shifts the series into full-fledged action RPG territory</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Seven years after the original, the lockdown on the Oldest House has collapsed, and the <strong>paranatural chaos</strong> has spilled out into a <strong>quarantined, "open-ended" Manhattan</strong>. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse’s brother, <strong>Dylan Faden</strong>, players will have to fight this new reality-warping threat with the help of the <strong>Aberrant</strong>, a brutal, shapeshifting melee weapon that pairs with expanded psychic abilities.</p>



<p>With a heavy focus on <strong>build-crafting</strong>, varied enemy types that can match your mobility, and a <strong>meticulously authored version of New York City</strong>, <em>CONTROL Resonant</em> looks to be <strong>Remedy's most ambitious project to date</strong>, and one of the most interesting action RPGs to launch in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fable-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Fable (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It was early 2018 when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-game-confirmed-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first rumors</a> that <strong>Playground Games</strong> had decided to accept the arduous task of rebooting the long-dormant <strong>Fable</strong> series. The game itself was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, but it quickly became clear that it still had a long road ahead of its release. In 2022, a former Playground developer who worked on the project's early stages <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-progress-slow-playground-lack-of-rpg-experience-frugal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the studio's lack of experience with role-playing games and their frugal approach to development were slowing down progress.</p>



<p>Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2023</a> with an in-game trailer that featured actor <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2024</a> with a trailer that featured actor <strong>Matt King</strong> as well as some gameplay. More importantly, that trailer came with a promise of a <strong>2025 launch</strong>, which of course did not happen. In February 2025, Xbox Studios head <strong>Craig Duncan</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game required additional development time and was thus <strong>delayed until 2026</strong>, accompanied by some promising new gameplay footage.</p>



<p>There has been no further news from the studio. A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Fable might not even make it next year, although for now, there's no solid evidence to confirm that. As such, we remain hopeful in a 2026 release. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2>



<p>As mentioned above, 2026 is poised to be a fantastic year for role-playing games, and selecting only five titles proved to be a daunting task. Below are several more notable titles that are expected to make waves in the next 12 months.</p>

            <guid>1394758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Official Cinematic: Ties That Bind ft. Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyK3lFtz2H8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>
