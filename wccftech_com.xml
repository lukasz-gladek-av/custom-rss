			<p>In 2021, seven developers from Gearbox, Bethesda, and Epic Games decided to team up and take a huge risk by creating a brand new game studio called Ruckus Games. Since they created the studio, it has been fairly quiet. Today,&nbsp; they've unveiled some sneak peeks into their upcoming debut title, and those who are interested are being given the opportunity to playtest the game and help the team. This title is being led by CEO and Game Director Paul Sage, who was the previous Creative Director of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-borderlands-3-post-launch-interview/">Borderlands 3</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>Already, Ruckus Games has quite a huge potential, as there are industry giants from Gearbox, Riot Games, Blizzard, and many more. Each founding member of Ruckus Games brings essential know-how to create a multiplayer game that is set to stand out from the crowd and draw in the audience.</p>
<p>When pitching to investors, Ruckus Games managed to sell their prototype to investors rather quickly, receiving $19 million in funding to help bring their multiplayer vision to life. The investors (who are not mentioned by name) were sold on the premiere project after playing just 20 minutes of a demo. Considering that when this happened, the studio was brand-new, and the prototype was made in 12 months, it's quite an impressive feat and is bound to leave people curious about what they could possibly have in store for those who may playtest the game.</p>
<p>At the moment, the title of Ruckus' project hasn't been announced. The title will be up to four-player co-op, with the world continuing to evolve and receive new content over time. The game takes place in a "reminiscent era amid the backdrop of the American heartland," where players are just ordinary people who are forced to try and become heroes when the town starts to get attacked. The game will feature a large roster of playable characters, with lots of weapon combinations that are wacky and fun to pull the audience in.</p>
<p>These weapon combos include a toaster that can shoot saw blades or a powerwasher-turned flamethrower. As you explore and unlock new items, you can cause as much havoc as you like, rescue NPCs, and go back to your Hometown, where you can customize, build, and upgrade your living area, which will then give you the option to upgrade your weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>"We want games where people have fun from the get-go. Games that are physical, joyous, and just a damn good time to be shared with others. We can't wait to show you what we have in store," says Game Director and Ruckus Games CEO Paul Sage.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in seeing what Ruckus Games has on offer, you are encouraged to sign-up to participate in the playtest on their <a href="https://www.ruckus-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>

			<p>Avowed wasn't delayed to 2025 because the game was in bad shape but due to the "avalanche" of games releasing in the final few months of 2024, according to Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, the Xbox head talked about the next role-playing game by Obsidian Entertainment and its delay, saying that it wasn't delayed because it was in bad shape and the developer needed more time to work on the game but because there was an avalanche of games scheduled to release in the final few months of the year. Postponing a game was something that Microsoft could afford since they had the Diablo IV expansion Vessel of Hatred, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Obsidian will also make sure of this extra time they got but did not need in any capacity.</p>
<p>It has been some time since we have seen Avowed in action. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/">A few months back</a>, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden talked about some of the less talked-about mechanics, such as the radial wheel that allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they want to do. The full gameplay demo from a few months back also provided another look at other gameplay mechanics and three different archetypes and at how Obsidian used the Pillars of Eternity world to present a slightly different RPG experience than what the franchise has presented to date.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th worldwide.</p>

			<p>New The First Berserker: Khazan gameplay was shared online today, providing a new look at the upcoming action role-playing game in development by Neople.</p>
<p>The new footage, shared as part of <a href="https://www.gstar.or.kr/eng/gstar/gstar_info.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-Star 2024</a>, which runs from today until November 17th in Busan, South Korea, showcases an intense battle against Volbaino as well as gameplay set in Mount Heinmach, one of the first locations Khazan explores after being freed from imprisonment. You can find the new footage below.</p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan has quickly become one of my most anticipated games set to release in 2025 after I tried it out during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/">Gamescom</a>. As I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"> preview</a>, the Technical Closed Beta Test held last month only confirmed my positive opinion of the game.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Today, British independent developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellion-ceo-egs-exclusivity-was-very-good-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebellion</a> announced the release date of its next game, Atomfall. This single player survival action game will be available starting March 27, 2025 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PC and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Pre-orders are now live, with the regular edition priced at $49.99 and a digital-only Deluxe Edition priced at $69.9.

<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is set in an alternate world where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windscale</a> nuclear accident was much bigger and more troublesome than in reality. Five years later, players will freely explore the fictional quarantine zone, scavenging, crafting, trading, fighting and talking their way through a British countryside full of bizarre characters, mysticism, cults and rogue government agencies.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the main features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Player-driven mystery:</strong> Unravel a tapestry of interwoven narratives through exploration, conversation, investigation and combat, where every choice you make has consequences.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Explore this green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Search, scavenge, survive:</strong> You'll have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out alive.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Desperate combat:</strong> With weapons and ammunition in short supply, each frenetic battle will see you combine marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat. Manage your heart rate to maintain a steady aim and ensure you have the energy to grab your cricket bat and land that killer blow.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you. Navigate cult-controlled ruins, natural caves, nuclear bunkers and more as you explore this dense, foreboding world.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Reimagining Windscale:</strong> A fictional reimagining of a real-life event, Atomfall draws on science fiction, folk horror, and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet utterly alien.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Infinity Nikki, the latest game in the Nikki franchise created by Infold Games is set to release on December 5, 2024. This news comes after extensive Beta testing on both PC, PlayStation and even iOS and Android. So far, Infinity Nikki is shaping up to be a huge success before the game has even become available, as over <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home?shortlink=ajkmiqf2&amp;c=925TrailerPR&amp;pid=X6_MKT_PR&amp;af_click_lookback=30d&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 million players have pre-registered</a> to play this upcoming game. If you want to see what we thought about the title, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-preview-glitz-and-glamor/">our preview of Infinity Nikki</a> here for more information about what to expect.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get stuck into Infinity Nikki when the game releases, it is set to release on December 5 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android. There is no news about whether it will come to Xbox Series X|S in the future, but it seems that with games similar to this, it takes a reasonably long time to consider. For example, Genshin Impact has been widely available for a few years now, with the PlayStation 5 version of the game being released in 2021. However, Genshin Impact is only now coming to Xbox Series X|S this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4dbzntYMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is the fifth entry in the Nikki franchise and sees Nikki go on an expansive journey with her companion Momo, bringing the franchise to PC and PS5 for the first time ever. Infinity Nikki utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to get a vast degree of realism and sparkle to the game to bring it to life. This title is helmed by Kentaro Tominaga, a game industry veteran who worked on Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, bringing that same magical feel to Infinity Nikki. Players will get to explore a vibrant world with a ton of activities to take part in, such as fishing, pet grooming, and, of course, fashion contests. While fashion is typically the forefront of the game for the Nikki franchise, this title brings quests, a fun cast of characters to interact with, and lots of ways to platform and navigate the world to find little secrets scattered around Miraland.</p>
<p>To celebrate the official release date of Infinity Nikki, a brand-new trailer has been released, which showcases the full Infinity Nikki theme song Together Till Infinity for the first time ever. This song is performed by pop singer Jessie J, who is known for creating hits such as Price Tag, Domino, and Bang Bang.</p>
