			<p>With <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> being almost a year away, fans of the popular Rockstar Games series have no other option than playing older entries in the series, or GTA Online, to get their fix.</p>



<p>While many of the older games haven't aged too badly, some of them are starting to show their age, prompting fans to seek new ways besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"><strong>official remasters</strong></a> to enjoy some of these all-time classics with improved visuals and gameplay, such as <strong>an upcoming modding project that will bring the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas experience to the latest iteration of the series' engine.</strong></p>



<p>Revolution Team, the modding team behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/"><strong>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition project</strong></a>, revealed Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition, a Grand Theft Auto V overhaul mod that will bring <strong>the entirety of the game</strong> initially released on PlayStation 2 to the <strong>latest iteration of the RAGE engine</strong>. This means that all content, from main missions to side missions, will be playable within Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>At this time, <strong>very little information is available</strong>, and for a good reason. <em>"This time, we will be sharing details more cautiously,"</em> the team stated, <strong>possibly to avoid what happened with their Vice City project</strong>, which faced significant legal pressure and social media takedowns from Take-Two Interactive earlier this year, eventually leading the mod to be released as a standalone package to ensure its survival. With the promise of <em>"something truly special"</em> in the works, however, <strong>there are definitely some exciting times ahead for fans of the series.</strong></p>

<p>At this point, the question is: <strong>"Will Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition release <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">before Grand Theft Auto 6?</a>"</strong> Revolution Team did not say so, but there's no denying that fans of the series have a great 2026 to look forward to!</p>
