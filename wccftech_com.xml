			<p>AMD FSR 4 is a big leap forward for the upscaling tech, delivering better image quality than its previous iteration despite not reaching the same quality as NVIDIA DLSS 4 with the new Transformer model, according to a new comparison shared today.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their first look at the new iteration of AMD's upscaling technology, the first to be powered by machine learning and exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs. In terms of performance, AMD FSR 4 is heavier than FSR 3, as seen in the Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart opening sequence, where FSR 4 is around 8% slower than average using the settings at the Performance preset. The performance cost, however, is well worth it, according to Digital Foundry, as the new version of the tech addresses every major image quality issue of its predecessor, such as particle effects, which no longer sport massive ghosting, transparent surfaces, which show detail that was lost with FSR 3, quality of objects of low relative motion, which now sport improved surface detail. The biggest leap, however, is with complex motions, where AMD FSR 4 blows the previous iterations of the upscaler out of the water.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 isn't just a massive leap forward from previous iterations of the upscaler but also delivers better image quality than NVIDIA DLSS with the older CNN model in certain scenarios, such as with objects at rest or low velocity, where AMD's tech resolves more detail. Compared to DLSS with the new Transformer model, however, AMD FSR 4 falls short, as NVIDIA's tech clearly does a better job at resolving detail. With objects in motion, however, AMD FSR 4 is comparable to the CNN model, which is an amazing result considering how much FSR 3 lagged behind DLSS in terms of visual quality, providing RX 9000 series GPUs owners with a solid upscaling solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, AMD FSR 4 is exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT.

			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for the launch of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12-gb-graphics-card-launched-will-549-msrp-models-be-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card</a>. The driver is also optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fragpunk-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-its-in-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a>. The latter game, a fast-paced 5v5 hero shooter from developer Bad Guitar Studio, will take advantage of the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, when it launches launch tomorrow. The game also supports ray tracing effects.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can deliver an average 4.6x performance boost at 4K with all settings maxed out. On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the game can reportedly run at almost 500 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode with the newest transformer model. I would wager anyone should rather choose DLAA to get better image quality instead. Also, enabling NVIDIA Reflex can reduce your system's latency by up to 60%, which could make all the difference between life and death in a competitive multiplayer shooter like FragPunk.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Nacon and Eko Software will also launch the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished in early access, with day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Dragonkin: The Banished is expected to stay in early access for seven to ten months.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two games launched with varying levels of NVIDIA RTX technology support. The first one is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</a>, which supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex, with Frame Generation slated to be added later. The other game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678820/Vector_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Strike</a>, a free-to-play hybrid of sports game and first-person shooter based on fast-paced, physics-based action. In the title developed by Chamo Games, players face each other in a 4v4 arena. NVIDIA RTX users can enable DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Recently, Valve also introduced support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex (which can improve latency by up to 45% in this instance) in its upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadlock</a>, currently in testing with a selected number of users. The third-person 6v6 MOBA still doesn't have a release date.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Koei Tecmo's PC port of Rise of the Ronin (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched last year on consoles</a>) will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation when it debuts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-march-11th-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 11</a>.</p>
