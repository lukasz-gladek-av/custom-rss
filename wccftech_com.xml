			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLDUmptln8&amp;pp=2AYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a> dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the franchise, Creative Assembly announced that Total War: Medieval III is now in early development.</p>



<p>In the official announcement article, the developers position the game as a return to a grounded, systems-driven historical Total War, with a heavy focus on politics, religion, and feudal power structures, rather than just map-painting conquest and a focus on medieval Europe and its neighboring regions, rather than a globe-spanning map. </p>



<p>The game is being developed with the next-generation Warcore engine, an evolution of the Total War engine intended to power future titles and support both PC and consoles. The team confirmed plans to bring Total War experiences to PlayStation and Xbox using this technology, while emphasizing that high-end PC strategy remains the priority and that the series will stay at the forefront of large-scale battles.</p>

<p>While Total War: Medieval III was undoubtedly the showcase's highlight, there was plenty more, starting with the availability of the premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER III</a> DLC Tides of Torment, which adds three new Legendary Lords to the High Elves, Norsca, and Slaanesh races. Furthermore, the stream unveiled the upcoming Lords of The End Times Pack, which will unleash four new Legendary Lords into the colossal Immortal Empires campaign (which, by the way, is now available for free to <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-review-monsters-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER I</a> &amp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-ii-its-bloody-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER II</a> players) experience in Summer 2026. The first to be revealed is none other than the great necromancer, Nagash, who returns to reclaim his lost power and drown the world in undeath.</p>

<p>These new lords also herald the arrival of the free End Times Update. Drawing inspiration from the lore, players will embark on a campaign experience transformed, featuring apocalyptic scenarios and cataclysmic events that push the boundaries of strategy and survival. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come.</p>



<p>Today's announcements aren't everything. There's an unannounced Total War project that will be fully revealed at The Game Awards in a week from today. Creative Assembly described this as the next major release in one of the most ambitious games in Total War's entire history, framing it as the start of the franchise's exciting new era.</p>
