			<p>NVIDIA announced that the Borderlands franchise (with the exception of the spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands) is now available to stream on its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. As you might recall, publisher 2K was among those companies that <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-is-the-latest-publisher-to-remove-its-lineup-from-geforce-now-while-epic-games-vows-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of GeForce NOW</a> when the service first launched out of beta in early 2020.</p>
<p>Something must have changed recently, though. The Mafia franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> GeForce NOW last month, and now it's time for Gearbox's first-person looter shooter games. Moreover, the upcoming Borderlands 4 will be available to stream on day one. Its system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't that high</a>, but it's still welcome news.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is already available on GFN, but BioShock, X-COM, and the sports games (NBA, WWE, Top Spin, PGA Tour) aren't. Will they be the next 2K franchises to join GeForce NOW? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, here's the full list of GFN additions for this week:</p>
