			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>

			<p>With just about two weeks before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a>, UK developer Rebellion has shared the minimum system requirements needed to play the game's PC version. They're not too different from what we see nowadays, though the good news is that the game (powered as usual by Rebellion's proprietary Asura engine) won't occupy too much space on your drive.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 or later</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel CPU Core i5-9400f or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia 2060 6GB or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;60 GB available space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a fresh features trailer out today, too, and you can watch it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Features Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k1QT6gM5wY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is being labeled as Rebellion's take on Fallout, although it is more of a survival action game than a roleplaying game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic British countryside landscape heavily inspired by the real-life Windscale Fire disaster of the 1950s in England, unfolding in a quarantined environment where players must uncover the mysteries of a nuclear disaster while surviving in a militarized zone. The setting includes inspirations from the likes of Doctor Who and even folk horror.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Atomfall will let players explore a non-linear world filled with complex characters and ambiguous moral dilemmas. The story will also change depending on the player's decisions. This design was crafted to encourage multiple playthroughs, with players experiencing different facets of the game based on their choices.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself won't be about running and gunning. Players will have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out of the quarantined zone. Weapons and ammunition are in short supply, so each frenetic battle will see them forced to mix ranged with hand-to-hand combat. In a nod to Rebellion's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-resistance-sniping-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite series</a>, players will have to manage their character's heart rate to maintain a steady aim.</p>
<p>Atomfall will launch on March 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though the Deluxe Edition provides three days of early access as well as a few in-game items and access to an upcoming expansion. The game will be available on release day for all Game Pass subscribers.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Hazelight Studios <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that their latest game, Split Fiction, has already sold over a million copies in just two days since its debut on the market. The immense popularity of the studio's previous release, the award-winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> (which sold 23 million copies, over twice as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Way Out</a>'s 11 million units), certainly contributed to the great hype surrounding the latest co-op adventure crafted by Josef Fares and his team.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/Hazelight+Studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam figures</a>. While A Way Out peaked at just 8.5K concurrent users and It Takes Two reached 71K concurrent users, Split Fiction registered 259K concurrent users three days ago, with the potential to set a new record this coming weekend.</p>
<p>The game also got a warm reception from critics overall, as evidenced by the 91 average Metacritic score. Our Nathan Birch was slightly less enthusiastic about it, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving it an 8 out of 10 score</a>.</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Are you enjoying Hazelight's new game so far?</p>
<p>In other news, Josef Fares recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his opinion</a> on the damage that the microtransaction business model deals to developer creativity.</p>

			<p>During a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wicked Inside</a>, Moon Studios revealed major news about its in-development action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a>. Arguably the most important tidbit is that the Austrian developer has secured the game's publishing rights back from Private Division, after several months of legal negotiations. This will allow the studio to be fully independent when making decisions about the title. To celebrate the occurrence, there's a 30% discount valid for another 32 hours or so.</p>
<p>Moon Studios then moved on to share details about the next big update, The Breach, out on April 30. This update will expand the campaign and introduce new areas, armors, factions, enemies, and weapons, roughly doubling the world size. The new areas include the Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, while players will encounter new foes known as the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</p>
<p>The Breach will add new weapon archetypes (gauntlets &amp; wands) to No Rest for the Wicked and an updated loot system for more build variety. Furthermore, the game world is getting more dynamic thanks to the 'Alive' system, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape it. The Plague system will also unleashe powerful new plague enemies and bosses. Plague outbreaks now occur throughout Sacra, and players can cleanse these regions to gain powerful new plague resources.</p>
<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are also included, such as the ability to teleport directly to your home, improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, timer improvements, and a redesigned storage system. Additionally, there's now a Hardcore mode, and visual and performance have been enhanced and optimized with improved lighting and NVIDIA DLSS implementation.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After The Breach, the following big update will introduce multiplayer for up to four players. A preview of that is coming soon. The developer is also planning further expansions to the city, housing, farming, and progression systems, as well as further refinements to combat. Lastly, the celebrated composer of the Ori series, Gareth Coker, has rejoined Moon Studios and will contribute new music to No Rest for the Wicked.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Francesco De Meo's early access hands-on preview</a>, the game has a lot of potential, although the developers clearly still need some time to realize it. The full game has no release date yet.</p>
