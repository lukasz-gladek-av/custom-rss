			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">a solid Soulslike with some interesting gameplay mechanics</a>, but performance issues at launch made it difficult for many - including myself - to enjoy the game at its best. Thankfully, developer Lenzee Games has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-coming/">actively addressing these issues</a>, with the latest 1.06 patch introducing major VRAM optimization and performance improvements on PC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/500584162306031816?l=english">1.06 patch</a>, which is around 5.3 GB big, adds the Deluxe Edition Expansion Content in all versions of the game while fixing several PC-specific issues, such as an issue that caused the visuals to be extremely blurry using NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Performance mode at certain screen resolutions. In addition, the new patch further optimizes VRAM usage, improving both performance and stability. This is an extremely important improvement, as it will allow those running GPUs with low VRAM capacities to have a much better experience. Even those with more powerful GPUs with more VRAM will notice the performance improvement, which are estimated to be up to 12% better than in the launch version on a midrange system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5600x CPU and an RTX 3070 GPU in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@S2GamesBench">S2Games Bench</a>.</p>

<p>Performance issues are not unique to WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, as it is one of the many recent games powered by Unreal Engine 5 suffering from performance issues. While Borderlands 4 enjoyed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">a successful launch</a>, it is heavily impacted by poor performance, requiring players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-optimized-settings-40-performance-imrpovement/">adjust graphics settings</a> even on high-end systems for better performance before Gearbox delivers the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">promised improvements</a>. Silent Hill f, by contrast, is a rare example of a UE5 title running smoothly (albeit at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-720p-360p-ps5/">low internal resolution on PS5</a>), with only minor stutters that do not impact what <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">I consider one of the finest survival-horror games released this year.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Less than two months after the launch of Mafia: The Old Country, a major member of that game's cast has confirmed to have heard that publisher Take-Two Interactive has greenlit a new installment. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN-0baTto-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by YouTuber Mafia Game Videos, actress Carina Conti, who played Enzo Favara's beloved Isabella Torrisi in the recently released game, said as much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7doMj5TEtMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent livestream with Bubbly Nuggets</a>. Of course, we should take the news with a grain of salt, but it is possible she may know about it.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country had a seemingly successful launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 800K units in its first week on the market</a>. Sure, it did not make big waves, but it also did not need to. The game was developed over just three years as a linear, smaller, and less costly title that retailed at $49.99. This tells us it shouldn't take long for the game to break even and become profitable; we should know more after the next Take-Two quarterly financial report, which will be shared in November. </p>



<p>I largely enjoyed my time with Mafia: The Old Country, albeit with some reservations, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Did you buy the game yet? If so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments section below. </p>

			<p>For TGS 2025, NetEase Games and Naked Rain (a studio with offices in Hangzhou and Montreal) have shared a new gameplay trailer of ANANTA, an intriguing and very much anime GTA-looking open world game.</p>



<p>In development as a free-to-play game for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices, ANANTA aims to immerse players in a living, breathing metropolis where every alleyway is filled with stories waiting to be discovered. The map is dotted with interactive hotspots where players can trigger events such as petting cats in parks and gang clashes. Players can snoop on passersby's phones or defy traffic laws with reckless street racing. Naked Rain also promises 'intelligent and lifelike behavior' from the NPCs that populate the city. Interiors will be accessible across three vertical layers: rooftops, mid-levels, and ground floors.</p>



<p>To move around the city, players may use public transportation, such as subways and buses, as well as cars, taxis, and helicopters. There are also special traversal techniques like 'swinging' (which sounds a lot like Spider-Man's signature traversal method) to get around quickly. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>ANANTA features plenty of combat, too. Naked Rain said that there is a high degree of environmental interactivity, allowing players to use items like golf clubs or trash bins as weapons to defeat enemies. In addition to their own gear, players can take enemy weapons during battle to experience different combat styles. Combat itself includes action staples like dodging and blocking.</p>



<p>In terms of narrative, players will step into the role of the new captain of a special task force, navigate city streets, forge alliances, and unravel mysterious threats to daily life. By seamlessly switching between diverse roles, they'll experience multifaceted urban livesâ€”each with unique personal stories. They will get to protect justice as a cop, infiltrate the Internet as a hacker, race through alleys as a delivery man, or chase fame as a live-streamer.</p>



<p>There's no word yet on any release window, but we'll make sure to report the info once available. Meanwhile, you can pre-register on the <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>.</p>
