			<p>While opinions may vary on how Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series' signature formula and gameplay, there's no denying that the game's performance on PC and consoles isn't where it should be. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4 is a step in the right direction for sure</strong></a>, but more work is needed besides&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the over 100 performance improvements introduced</strong></a>&nbsp;to finally address what is, sti</span>ll today, one of the game's biggest issues, if not the biggest.</p>



<p>Besides working on improving Monster Hunter Wilds' performance, however, some datamined information suggests that CAPCOM could be working on something else as well: <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game.</strong></p>



<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/"><strong>Monster Hunter Leaks subreddit</strong></a>, some dedicated users took a good look at the aforementioned Title Update 4, discovering some information on the potential arrival of <strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong> and additional content in the future. The most interesting discovery, however, is the addition of some platform information mentioning a <strong>"nsw2UpgradeEdition"</strong>, possibly referencing a Nintendo Switch 2 release for the game.</p>

<p>Considering how Monster Hunter Wilds runs on PC and consoles, the community's reaction didn't disappoint. <span><em>"Game barely runs on PC properly, and they expect it to port to Switch 2?"</em>&nbsp;said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxx67z/comment/nwe8ta9/"><strong>Ayyzeee</strong></a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, echoing what most of the community thinks about this port, which looks more impossible than the solid <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</strong></a> Nintendo Switch 2 ports.</span> </p>



<p><em>"The Steam Deck can barely run this as is, and now we have a SW2 port? </em><span><em>Good luck,"</em>&nbsp;said <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415472">Kindekuma on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, further highlighting how the community doesn't think bringing Monster Hunter Wilds to Nintendo Switch 2 is the b</span>est idea.</p>



<p>Other users didn't miss the chance to joke on what could be expected out of this Nintendo Switch 2 port. <em>"Now at a blistering 480p/20fps"</em>, <em>"Are they going to upscale 160 × 144px to 1080p?"</em> said ResetERA users <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149414158">Mars People</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415184"><strong>Melhadf.</strong></a> <em>"Potato Mode"</em> is also a recurring joke, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149419351"><strong>Dale Copper's image</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how possible is a Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong> As the Nintendo console already proved to be a more than capable system with some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">excellent multiplatform ports</a></strong>, there's no denying that getting the latest entry in the series to run properly on the system can be a challenge. </p>



<p>Currently, the Steam Deck struggles to run the game properly, even with aggressive upscaling, so the game would require significant optimization for the system to achieve a stable 30 FPS. Still, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-impress-rog-ally-x-comparison/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS</strong></a>, this port could be surprisingly good, especially if performance continues to improve on other platforms as well.</p>



<p>Besides performance, which continues to remain a significant issue, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffered from a very low challenge level. This issue, thankfully, was addressed by the game's post-launch updates, <span>to the extent that the game's director, Yuya Takuda, hopes&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/" target="_blank"><strong>lapsed players will return to the game</strong></a>, which, in my opinion,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank"><strong>still deserves to be played</strong></a>, despite</span> its issues.</p>
