			<p>During the Future Game Show stream, Owlcat Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>) delivered the surprise announcement of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn. This is going to be the studio's first stab at third-person action RPG, and it takes place in the beloved sci-fi universe created by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck.</p>
<p>This is a story-driven sci-fi action RPG in which you play a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and caught up in a conspiracy that spans the entire solar system and is beyond your control, the player must adapt and survive by taking command of the most advanced ship in the solar system.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn lets players create and customize their character, who can be an Earther, a Martian, or a Belter. They'll then lead a crew of specialists against escalating threats, political pressure, and a relentless enemy. Owlcat promises that every decision will matter.</p>
<p>The player's companions are more than just mission assets: they are individuals with their own histories and allegiances. Some chase redemption, while others hide their truths. Over time, relationships with them will flourish or deteriorate depending on the player's choices and leadership style.</p>
<p>Combat is based on cover-focused gunplay and abilities. Two companions accompany the player on missions, while others will provide support from a distance by disabling systems or drawing the enemies' attention. The player can issue real-time commands to adapt quickly to survive the myriad threats.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will allow fans to visit iconic locations from the books and TV show, such as Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. They'll walk through ruined habitats and political strongholds mired in unease and tension. Talking to the locals can help uncover secrets. Owlcat also teased that there may be familiar faces or voices, hinting at some of the main cast from the original story making an appearance.</p>

			<p>Developer Sonka's psychological survival horror game Holstin just got a brand new trailer during the Future Games Show, along with the news that a new, 2-hour-long demo is available for players to try, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous demos that have been available on Steam, which focused on specific mechanics in Holstin, this new demo is just the first two hours of the game for players to try, and get the full opening experience.</p>
<p>Holstin is a Resident Evil, Silent Hill-inspired horror game that uses 2XD rendering, allowing the team to "<em>seamlessly shift between multiple perspectives in real-time, lit, fully 3D pixel environments,</em>" according to a press release. Set in 1990s Poland, in a lakeside town called Jeziorne-Kolonia, you&nbsp;play as Tomasz, one of the last remaining locals who hasn't yet turned into an ooze-riddled creature.</p>
<p><iframe title="Holstin: Jeziorne-Kolonia Demo Shadow Drop | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0O3ofy7-iFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Holstin is currently planned to be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and PC, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonkagames/holstin">Kickstarter campaign</a> planned to launch later in 2025 to help the development team get the game over the finish line.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of indie horror games break through into the main gaming conversation in the last few years, with games like Signalis, Crow Country, and Mouthwashing becoming indie-darlings for horror fans, all of them leaning into pixel art and a slightly more retro-look-and-feel to enhance the scares they have waiting for players.</p>
<p>Holstin looks like it could be the next game on that list, if the horror is able to deliver when it launches in the hopefully near future.</p>
