			<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally live on Steam with its long-anticipated 1.0 release. To celebrate the occasion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview with Nikita Buyanov</a>, Game Director of Battlestate Games, discussing the long journey toward the full launch, the content available in this new version, some of what will be coming in the future, and a few thoughts on the genre as a whole.</p>



<p>Additionally, we also inquired about controller support for the PC version and about a potential launch on console platforms. Here's what Buyanov told us:</p>



<p><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></p>



<p>It does sound like this is still further away, since the studio hasn't even begun working on it yet. It may be quite a while, considering how long it took Battlestate Games to release Escape from Tarkov. Still, it's good news for all those who'd love to play it on consoles, or at least to play it on PC, but with the comfort of a gamepad.</p>
