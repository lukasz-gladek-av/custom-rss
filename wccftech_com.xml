			<p>Earlier today, when we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/">Billbil-kun's report on Dealabs</a> that leaked a few of the games coming to the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue, we wrote that the official announcement probably wasn't too far behind, and that if it didn't appear today, it would surely appear before the end of the week. Well, we were right the first time, as a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-silent-hill-2-until-dawn-v-rising-yakuza-like-a-dragon-and-more/">PlayStation Blog post</a> confirmed most of the Dealabs report, with some additional announcements not in the report.</p>



<p>Starting off, yes, Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake is the big headlining game for PS Plus Extra for October 2025. It's also joined by the 2024 version of Until Dawn, V Rising, and As Dusk Falls, as we saw in the earlier report. Dealabs also got one of the PS Plus Premium games right coming into the Classics Catalogue with the original PlayStation version of Tekken 3 entering the service. Everything will also arrive, as predicted, next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>



<p>What we didn't see in the Dealabs report is that Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1, and Wizard with a Gun are also joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue this month. Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium this month.</p>



<ul>
<li>Silent Hill 2 Remake - PS5</li>



<li>Until Dawn (2024) - PS5</li>



<li>V Rising - PS5</li>



<li>Yakuza: Like a Dragon - PS5, PS4</li>



<li>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 - PS5, PS4</li>



<li>As Dusk Falls - PS5, PS4</li>

<p>Looking at the full lineup of PS Plus games for October, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/">between Alan Wake 2</a>, Silent Hill 2 Remake, V Rising, Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1, and Until Dawn (2024), it's a more than solid lineup of horror-themed games for this time of year. </p>

			<p>One of the best narratives in gaming to come out of 2024, and one of the best games from 2024 that initially launched on PC and Nintendo Switch, is finally arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year. 1000xResist from the new Canadian indie studio Sunset Visitor will arrive on the rest of the current-gen consoles next month, on November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Also, for any Xbox players <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">who didn't rush to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions</a>, you'll be able to check out 1000xResist when it arrives on Xbox consoles through Game Pass.</p>

<p>1000xResist is set 1,000 years into the future, and sees you step into a clone named Iris when humanity is on the verge of its end. Iris is one of six sisters, and throughout the game's narrative, you peel back the mystery behind ALLMOTHER, the new ruler over the last remaining members of humanity, and unweave her web of lies.</p>



<p>At its heart, amidst all the sci-fi dressings, 1000xResist is a deep narrative about familial relationships and shared trauma, and was easily one of the best games to come out of 2024. It was nominated for several awards, though arguably was criminally overlooked compared to other indie titles that got a little more recognition last year.</p>
