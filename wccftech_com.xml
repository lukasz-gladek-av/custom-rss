			<p>In September 2023, the existence of a new Xbox controller was <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-controller-to-feature-haptics-and-speakers-like-ps5s-dualsense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> due to the inadvertent sharing of an internal Microsoft document as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft legal fight. The controller, codenamed Sebile, would feature improved wireless, direct-to-cloud connection, Bluetooth 5.2, new modular thumbsticks, replaceable and rechargeable batteries, and other minor improvements. The big addition, though, was the DualSense-like haptics feature.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-by-microsofts-head-of-gaming-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his appreciation</a> for the PlayStation 5 controller when it launched alongside Sony's console in late 2020. A few months later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-phil-spencer-xbox-controller-updates-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> the concept while also teasing that Xbox would have to catch up in this area. The document leak proved he was very serious about that. However, since there haven't been any official updates on the topic, there was no way to know whether the project bore fruit. After all, it could have easily been canceled.</p>
<p>Fans needn't worry too much about that. Tech4Gamers <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> a newly published <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patent</a> clearly linked to the Sebile Xbox controller. The patent was originally filed in late August 2023, just before the aforementioned FTC leak. Here's the patent's abstract:</p>
<p><em>A device configured to generate haptic feedback is disclosed. The device includes a housing, a connector, and a haptic motor. The connector includes a mount end coupled to the housing and a distal end spaced away from the mount end. The haptic motor is coupled to the distal end of the connector. Activation of the haptic motor causes the haptic motor to move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed up</a> by adding that the new Xbox controller is definitely still on the way. However, it is now planned to launch alongside the next Xbox console. Microsoft chose not to invest in a mid-generation refresh like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro</a>; they are instead all-in on the forthcoming generation, which Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> would bring the biggest technical leap ever seen in a console.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild rumors</a> that Microsoft could launch the new hardware earlier than Sony, perhaps as soon as 2026, to get an advantage over its competitor (the PlayStation 6 is currently believed to be targeting a 2028 debut). If that's the case, then the Sebile Xbox controller might not be that far off, either.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Squid Game Event Rumored To Have Additional Premium Pass in CoD: Black Ops 6]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6.1070205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to <a href="https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.</p>
<p>This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.</p>

<p>The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called <a href="https://x.com/xFleXy_/status/1872710285649428579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFleXy_ on X</a>, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:</p>
<p><em>Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.</em></p>
<p>A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.</p>
<p>It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.</p>
<p>Will you be getting the battle pass for the Squid Game event?</p>

			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>—more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
