<p>Funnily enough, that art direction is so convincing that it recently triggered <strong>a national antiquities investigation in the Middle East.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"This can't be for real, my Expedition Journal that comes with the Monolith Set got detained by customs for being 'possibly ancient"</em>, reported Reddit user Ahmed15252 on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1r0vyqt/my_expedition_journal_art_book_was_detained_by/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 subreddit</strong></a>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Customs opened the package and decided the art book looked a bit too ancient. You know… drawings, symbols, vibes, Result: The book has been officially sent to the Iraqi Museum / Technical Committee to confirm that it is in fact a modern video game art book and not a newly discovered lost artifact."</em></p>



<p>The user ended their story with a touch of irony: <em>“10/10 experience will definitely accidentally import history again.”</em> While many critics have argued that <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> deserves to be in a museum</strong>, no one expected it to happen via a customs seizure.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Iraq may have mistaken it for history, but <strong>France has officially declared it art</strong>. Just last week, the developers at Sandfall Interactive were named <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/an-exceptional-decoration-for-an-exceptional-success-clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-receive-frances-highest-cultural-honor/"><strong>Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</strong></a></em>, receiving France's highest cultural honor. French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati presented the team with an <em>"exceptional decoration for an exceptional success,"</em> highlighting <strong>a level of prestige rarely seen in the video game industry.</strong></p>
