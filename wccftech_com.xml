			<p>Another Black Friday, a whole new batch of deals for those patient players who were willing to wait for a good deal, and for Final Fantasy fans, or anyone wanting to see what all the fuss is about, that deal seems to be here. On Amazon, you can grab the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy (so far) for just $50.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade is the complete version of the beginning of this trilogy, including the base game and the Intergrade DLC expansion that Square Enix released for it post-launch. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B08XNRM6QN_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">You can grab it on PS5 right now on Amazon for only $20</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B0CGXZQ4CD_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">you can also grab it for PS5 on Amazon right now for only $30</a>. Some quick maths will tell you that for just $50, you can get the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, save for the third and final game in the trilogy, which Square Enix is still working on.</p>



<p>Development of which, according to Square Enix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">is coming along quite well</a>. It might still be a while until we find out more about the game, but it's good to hear positive updates from Square Enix on the game's progress.</p>

			<p>Today is Thanksgiving for the United States, which is really only significant for Americans. For the rest of the world, though, it means that tomorrow is Black Friday, and along with that come scores of deals available globally that players outside of the US care about as well, like the fact that you can now grab one of the hottest shooters of 2025, Battlefield 6, for just $35.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025" rel="sponsored noopener">IGN</a>, this is arguably one of the best Black Friday deals available for recent 2025 releases, especially when you consider that Battlefield 6 only launched on October 10, and a little more than a month later, it is available for half off. It was available at Amazon, but it very quickly sold out. You can still grab it at GameStop, however.</p>



<p>Here's both links to grab it for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/battlefield-6---playstation-5/428792.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 PS5 - GameStop</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/battlefield-6---xbox-series-x/428791.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 Xbox Series X/S - GameStop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is one deal you'll want to try and grab as quickly as possible, because it'll likely sell out or be removed before the weekend is up. It's an especially good deal if you've already been playing Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/">through the free trial currently ongoing this week</a>, because now you'll be able to continue the progress you've made.</p>

			<p>Around a month ago, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows, the latest mainline entry in the publisher's biggest open world franchise, would release on Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. The game's engine, the latest version of Anvil, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured many big improvements</a>, ushering the franchise into the next generation with technologies like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive ray tracing effects (global illumination and reflections)</li>



<li>Dynamic wind and rain driven by fluid simulation that affect trees, foliage, leaves, and even rainfall direction</li>



<li>Physics‑based, procedural cloud and weather simulation that continually evolves cloudscapes</li>



<li>Nanite‑style micropolygon system that virtualizes geometry, letting the engine render extremely detailed terrain and assets while smoothly adjusting triangle density with distance</li>



<li>Expanded destruction physics and improved cloth and material interaction</li>



<li>Overhauled terrain and asset streaming built around the aforementioned virtualized geometry system, keeping dense villages and varied topography loaded without hammering CPU or storage bandwidth</li>



<li>Deeper integration of GPU instancing and mesh shaders to cut CPU submission overhead and render many small objects efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 platform, however, is far less powerful than the platforms on which the game was first released on (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). According to Ubisoft's Project Lead Programmer Bruno, the developers had to fundamentally redesign how the world is rendered and even how the game systems of Assassin's Creed Shadows interact with each other.</p>



<p>Core simulation systems like clouds and cloth are preserved but heavily optimized and sometimes downscaled to lower GPU load, while global illumination uses the baked solution already employed on low-spec PC and Xbox Series S to save RAM rather than relying <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the console's hardware ray tracing support</a> to deliver ray traced GI.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Ubisoft had to extensively tune down every parameter (LOD, draw distances, texture resolution, and object streaming) per scenario, reducing NPC counts only where necessary in dense hubs to uphold performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The developers leveraged the Nintendo Switch 2's support of NVIDIA DLSS to reconstruct a sharp image from a lower resolution base, thus accelerating performance. Ultimately, however, Ubisoft settled on achieving a stable 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes. The difference, then, lies in the visual quality, which is further diminished in handheld mode, whereas docked mode offers improved image quality, increased draw distance, and more refined LOD settings.</p>



<p>The handheld mode does have a few tricks up its sleeve, such as HDR support and a tweaked implementation of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). Bruno explained:</p>



<p><em>The lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 FPS, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. We didn't want to compromise on that aspect, and so we built a dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 FPS, keeping the game as fluid and responsive as possible.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft is leveraging a few platform-specific features for this version of the game, such as touchscreen support for menus, maps, and hideout interactions. There are also plans for future mouse and keyboard compatibility in docked mode.</p>

<p>On December 2, players won't be able to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-unremarkable-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, which is coming at some point in 2026 to the Nintendo Switch 2. On that note, Ubisoft also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that it'll be the only major expansion coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, unlike the previous entry, Valhalla, which got three (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-of-politics-and-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrath of the Druids</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Siege of Paris</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-the-end-of-an-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of Ragnarök</a>).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/</link>
            <guid>1366792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The use of generative AI tools in game development has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a major point of controversy within the video game industry. Some figures, notably, many studio heads and executives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/">are all for using generative AI in game development</a>. Others <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">don't think it's necessary at all</a>. While we know Epic Games chief executive officer Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">sits firmly in the former camp</a>, he has also weighed in on another aspect of the issue, the fact that digital stores like Steam require developers to disclose that generative AI tools were used in the making of their game.</p>



<p>Currently, games published to Steam that were made with generative AI tools must disclose their use. ARC Raiders, for example, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">includes such a disclosure at the bottom of its Steam page</a>, though with how forward Embark Studios has been about its use of generative AI, we wouldn't have needed the tag to know generative AI tools were used.</p>



<p>In other cases, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">like the recently announced game Beyond Words from former Timesplitters and GoldenEye developers</a>, if not for the disclosure at the bottom, we'd likely not know generative AI tools had been used. And then there are those who still don't disclose its use, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/">admitting it only after they are caught having used it</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">don't admit it at all, and quietly patch it out</a>.</p>



<p>In response to Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman arguing for the removal of generative AI tags and disclosures on storefronts like Steam <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1988991435358482621">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Tim Sweeney agreed with Workman's post, saying that having generative AI tags on platforms like Steam "<em>makes no sense</em>."</p>



<p>Not because those who care about avoiding games made with generative AI have to keep an eye out for the disclosure, and even if it's not there, keep themselves aware for any signs of it. But because in his mind, there will come a day when every game is made with generative AI tools. </p>



<p>"<em>The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>GenAI being used in "<em>nearly all future production</em>" might be what the future looks like in Tim Sweeney's head, but it's debatable that GenAI tools will catch on to such a degree. When Nexon's chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">claimed that players should already be assuming all games are made with GenAI</a>, multiple developers stood up to point out that they would never use GenAI tools for their creative endeavours.</p>



<p>Whichever side you fall on, GenAI tools in game development, especially in triple-A game development, are undoubtedly here to stay. So there will continue to be games made with these tools, and we could get to a point where the disclosures are removed because enough games are using these tools. However, it would be interesting to see if developers who are against using GenAI would respond by highlighting that they did not use GenAI in making their game. It would seriously put to the test what executives are saying, <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">that consumers "<em>do not care</em>" if something was made with GenAI or not</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Seemingly Won’t Get Another Claws of Awaji-Sized Expansion, Says Ubisoft]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/</link>
            <guid>1366738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Interview With Post Launch Director Simon... (AC Shadows DLC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Iijrbz8XBc?start=559&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
