			<p>In what's become a very extended waiting period for Crimson Desert <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">after its earliest 2019 reveals</a>, now that we have a release date to look forward to, we seem to keep getting new gameplay looks at the coming open-world action-adventure title.</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfaon2NhA9k">IGN First preview series</a>, the latest gameplay showcase puts another boss fight on display, though this one isn't with a towering knight or angry spirit. This nine-minute gameplay showcase features a boss fight against a giant mechanical dragon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When Crimson Desert was first announced, it was intended to be a new MMORPG. Then, at the 2020 Game Awards, Pearl Abyss revealed a change in direction for the game: it would now be an open-world action-adventure title instead. Following that, the game's first major delay was announced in 2021, with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/">being delayed "<em>indefinitely</em>" at the time</a>. </p>



<p>It was then supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">arrive sometime in Fall 2025</a>, but it was delayed again and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">pushed into 2026</a>. In the meantime, the game kept appearing at annual shows like Gamescom (<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's event</a>) with new gameplay showcases, but no release date news. That didn't arrive until last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">when Pearl Abyss finally confirmed a release date</a> for Crimson Desert, with the game arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 19, 2026.</p>



<p>It'll have been a seven-year wait for players to get their hands on Crimson Desert from its reveal to its arrival. So long as it's not delayed again, that is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Old-School Open World Fantasy RPG Of Ash and Steel Gets New Demo and November 6 Launch Date]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-new-demo-and-november-6-launch-date.1323769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Fire &amp; Frost and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date of the old-school fantasy open world fantasy roleplaying game Of Ash and Steel. The game will be released for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_ash_and_steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a> on November 6.</p>



<p>Today, though, fans can play the new Steam demo, which features the beginning of Tristan's journey. Players will be able to spend several hours freely exploring the starting region of the game, following the main story and tackling numerous side quests. They can experiment with skill trees and professions, explore the area around the lumberjack camp, and help the lumberjacks with their hard labor. Finally, they can team up with Fox to investigate an abandoned village and find their way to the harbor.</p>



<p>The demo also features Arena Master Mode, where seasoned action RPG players can test their skills and Of Ash and Steel's combat system. This mode features fast-paced arena battles where Tristan can earn experience, gold, and fame. Players should upgrade their weapons and armor, master new techniques, and prove that they are worthy of being called the greatest gladiator in Grayshaft.</p>



<p>Our Francesco De Meo played the previous demo in July, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-a-very-long-journey-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his experience wasn't exactly great</a>, and he noted that Fire &amp; Frost would need a lot of work to make the game noteworthy:</p>



<p><em>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable experience</em>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping that Fire &amp; Frost managed to significantly improve the experience in a short time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-details-pax-australia-gearbox/</link>

			<p>Gearbox showed up to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">PAX Australia this year to show off some more details</a> about Borderlands 4 and what's up next for the game, with a few new details about its post-launch roadmap, including a teaser reveal for the first Bounty Pack coming to Borderlands 4: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</p>



<p>How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is a paid DLC drop that will arrive on November 20, 2025, which is just in time for its holiday and snow-filled aesthetic. It follows Rush trying to fix his own case of homesickness and restore some holiday cheer in his life by celebrating Mercenary Day, only to have those plans thwarted by Screw, the minister of culture for the Timekeeper. Unsurprisingly, that doesn't sit too well with Rush, and he goes on a hunt to save Mercenary Day and keep his holiday cheerful.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5FY6q7qdkY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This first Bounty Pack will also include new cosmetics for players, from weapon skins to Echo attachments and skins, Vault Hunter skins, and vehicle skins. It also adds four new legendary weapons, and a new vehicle. If you already own the Deluxe or Super Deluxe edition of Borderlands 4, then this Bounty Pack will arrive as an update for you on November 20. If not, you'll have to either purchase the Bounty Pack individually or as part of the Bounty Pack bundle.</p>



<p>With regards to upcoming free content, the Horrors of Kairos seasonal mini event is set to kick off on October 23, just in time for Halloween. It'll include the chance to grab a legendary assault rifle, the Murmur, and a legendary grenade called 'Skully.' Gearbox is also adding a new challenge for players to take on with Bloomreaper the Invincible, a new raid boss that will enter the fray at some point in December 2025.</p>



<p>These new bits of DLC and seasonal events cover the rest of what's to come to Borderlands 4 in 2025, with the game's first major story expansion currently set to arrive sometime in Q1 2026. You can see the newly updated roadmap below</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4 2025 Post-Launch Roadmap. Image credit: Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully, by then, Gearbox will be able to iron out most of the major issues Borderlands 4 launched with. The last patch from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-patch-fixes-performance-degradation-pc-introduces-vault-hunter-buffs/">studio arrived earlier this month</a>, addressing more performance issues as well as introducing new balancing tweaks for Vault Hunters. </p>



<p>Maybe we'll even have some news on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">which was indefinitely delayed shortly after the game's poor technical launch on PC and current-gen consoles</a>. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-now-bundled-base-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-is-now-bundled-with-the-base-game-to-celebrate-season-10-launch.1323727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, alongside the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 10: Nighthaven</a>, Amazon Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/521978797993492570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the New World DLC Rise of the Angry Earth is now free for all players.</p>



<p>Rise of the Angry Earth originally launched in October 2023 and has remained priced at $29.99, save for discount periods. It added a level cap increase, a new gear rarity, an endgame Expedition, a Heartrune ability, though its capstone feature was undoubtedly the addition of player mounts. Before that, players were forced to roam the vast world of Aeternum on their feet. This DLC did not encounter widespread adoption, though, and to this day it had remained a barrier to new and returning players, who wished to access mounts (and the rest of the content) without having to pay such a steep price.</p>



<p>Given the positive vibe around Season 10: Nighthaven, Amazon Games rightfully thought to remove this barrier for all those interested in playing New World. Of course, there's the issue of those who recently purchased Rise of the Angry Earth, but Amazon prepared a FAQ for that scenario:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>How can I get access to the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>For PC players who have purchased the New World base game but have not previously purchased the expansion, you should automatically receive the expansion. This will not require a separate download. Once the Season 10 update has been downloaded, players will be able to play all of the content in New World: Aeternum.</li>



<li><strong>What if I recently purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion? Can I get a refund?</strong></li>



<li>Any PC player who purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion in the past 30 days will receive a refund on their purchase. Steam will automatically process refunds. Players should not have to take action to get a refund. For eligible players, please allow up to 72 hours to receive your refund.</li>



<li><strong>If I’ve purchased New World: Aeternum, do I need the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>No. The expansion is only for PC players who purchased the original base game on Steam prior to New World: Aeternum’s release in 2024. All the content from the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion is already included in the New World: Aeternum game.</li>
</ul>

			<p>New footage reportedly showing the Leon campaign in Resident Evil Requiem may have already been released, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who, despite a mixed track record, <span>has proven to have access to insider information regarding the survival horror series by CAPCOM in the past</span>, Leon is already in the&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem first trailer&nbsp;in two small ways. According to the insider, they are minor but more obvious when looking back.</p>



<p>Besides discussing Leon's small appearance in the Resident Evil Requiem first trailer, Dusk Golem also mentioned that, from what they understand, most players will play as Leon. This seems to suggest the game won't have separate campaigns for Grace and Leon but a single, larger campaign featuring both characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon is in the first trailer, in two small ways, but they're minor and be more obvious when looking back.<br>While this is subjective, I believe with how the game is structured that more of the game will be played as Leon by most players from how I understand it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1976775421728637017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As there's still no official indication that Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem, we have to take what Dusk Golem said with a massive grain of salt. However, there could be some truth to the insider's latest statements. On X, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Persian">@RE_Persian</a> took a good look at what could be one of the sequences where footage lifted from the Leon campaign is shown. The footage strongly suggests the cutscene is from a first-person point of view that is not Grace's, as what seems to be her hair appears on one side of the screen, which wouldn't happen if it were her POV.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(4/5) the beginning of the shot, the camera slightly moves as if following a head movement. This is a classic sign of a first person POV. <a href="https://t.co/GmqLowA8Rd">pic.twitter.com/GmqLowA8Rd</a></p>— Resident Evil | رزیدنت اویل (@RE_Persian) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Persian/status/1977259021506613296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>With Resident Evil Requiem getting closer to its February 27, 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, there's a solid chance it won't take much longer to learn if Leon Kennedy is indeed in the game as rumored. In the meantime, check out my Gamescom hands-on preview to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">learn what already makes Grace's gameplay hauntingly beautiful.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-arrives-on-pc-and-consoles-this-month.1323706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beneath, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593230/Beneath/?curator_clanid=34817714">Lovecraftian-themed survival horror shooter</a> from developer Camel 101 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/">publisher Wired Productions</a>, finally has release dates set for its arrival on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. It'll arrive on PC on Steam this coming October 27, 2025, with its console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 coming the following day on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>Players would recognize Camel 101 from previous games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/715380/Those_Who_Remain/">Those Who Remain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/409320/Syndrome/?curator_clanid=34817714">Syndrome</a>, the former of which was also published by Wired Productions. Alongside the news of the game's full release, Camel 101 has also released a demo for the game on Steam as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">October Steam Next Fest</a>, which officially kicks off today, October 13, and runs until October 20.</p>



<p>Camel 101 also debuted a new launch trailer for Beneath, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beneath | Launch Date Trailer | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomQIDx4l90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beneath is a single-player shooter that sees you step into the shoes of Noah Quinn, a veteran diver who finds himself trapped under the ocean on what should have been a routine dive. Now, he has to contend with all sorts of horrors with whatever weapons and ammo he can find in this survival horror adventure.</p>



<p>With the third iteration of Steam Next Fest set to kick off today, Beneath isn't the only game you'll find with new demos available on Steam starting today. Also, don't be too concerned if you miss the festival, since several of the demos, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">including ones that we checked out back in June</a>, often aren't taken down once the festival is officially over. So if you know you won't have a moment over the next seven days to sit down and play some demos, mark what looks interesting and come back later - it will likely still be available to play and check out. </p>
