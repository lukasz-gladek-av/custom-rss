			<p>Valve's reveal of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">was one of 2025's biggest announcements</a>, and while players are excited about the potential of the new GabeCube, one question has hovered above the new hardware like a dark cloud (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">that grows even darker with memory shortage complications</a>): <strong>how much will the Steam Machine cost?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we don't yet have official pricing, but a leak from a Czech retailer may have just provided our first indication as to what the latest gaming box will cost. Shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingnewsandleaks/comments/1q88b1u/grain_of_salt_steam_machine_price_leaked_1000_for/">Reddit's GamingLeaksandRumors page by user chusskaptaan</a>, a third-party Czech retailer known as <a href="https://www.smarty.cz/Valve-Steam-Machine-512GB-4p249960">Smarty.cz has a live listing for the Steam Machine</a>, featuring two different models.</p>



<p>The first is a <strong>512GB</strong> model, which, according to the website's source code, seems to cost <strong>19,826 CZK</strong>, or approximately <strong>$950 USD</strong>. The other model is a <strong>2TB</strong> version, and it seems to be listed at <strong></strong><strong>22,305 CZK</strong>, or <strong>$1,070 USD.</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that these prices are estimates based on a conversion from Czech Koruna, and as the post itself notes, third-party retailers could have their own markups, which means the actual retail price of the machine from Valve could very well be lower.</p>



<p>That said, while Valve hasn't made any official announcements about the price, it's been made <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">clear from multiple sides of the tech industry that prices on hardware will increase</a> due to the current memory crisis, and when Valve was asked <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">if the company would be subsidizing the price of its new box</a>, the answer was a flat no.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market</em>," began software engineer at Valve, Pierre-Loup Griffais. "<em></em><em>Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is."</em></p>



<p>So while we've seen pricing estimates from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">creators like LinusTechTips who've tried to guess at what the cost of the new box would be</a> and found that it might not be too expensive, the reality might not be as kind. Still, for what the Steam Machine could be capable of, paying a little more than $1k for it is arguably still a good deal, when you consider the freedom of choice you get with a Steam Machine versus a traditional console or the cost of building your own PC.</p>



<p>As for when we could hear official words from Valve on the price, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/"> latest reports point to a <strong>Spring 2026</strong> release</a>, and if that's true, then we'll know sooner than later what the actual price will be. </p>

			<p>The emulator just got even more simplified, which will make it convenient to run games directly from the ISO files. </p>



<h2 id="h-iso-based-disc-loading-comes-to-rpcs3-emulator-but-only-decrypted-isos-are-supported">ISO-Based Disc Loading Comes to RPCS3 Emulator, But Only Decrypted ISOs Are Supported</h2>



<p>The popular PlayStation 3 emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-removes-amd-rx-400-500-and-nvidia-gtx-900-1000-series-from-recommended-gpu-requirements/">RPCS3</a>, just got a big update. Usually, one would need to extract the contents of the game ISO files to allow RPCS3 to run the game, but the new update just eliminated this step. Contributor <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Functionable </em>submitted the code, which removes a long-standing inconvenience for users who had to extract the disc images into folders to run the game. </p>



<p>This might look small on paper, but it is pretty meaningful and has several benefits. While the existing method of extracting the ISO files is reliable, it requires nearly double the storage, assuming the user doesn't delete the original ISO file. The new update allows loading the disc games directly from the ISO file and no longer needs manual extraction. So, not just one step less, but also no additional storage required.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RPCS3 now supports loading disc games from ISO files, thanks to code submitted by Functionable! Note that only decrypted ISO loading is supported for now, encrypted ISO loading is not yet supported. Loading disc games from folders continues to be supported without any changes.</p>



<p>- RPCS3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that the developers have announced that this will only apply to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"decrypted" </strong>ISOs, and any encrypted ISO images that are directly dumped from retail PS3 discs won't run. PlayStation 3 already possesses the hardware and firmware-based encryption pipeline to decrypt discs, but RPCS3 does not. Also, the older method of extracting the ISO will still work like before, and those who have already maintained an organized folder-based library shouldn't worry. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Larian Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced <strong>Divinity</strong></a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it likely did not think what would follow would be swarms of backlash targeted at the studio and its chief executive officer, <strong>Swen Vincke</strong>. Not because it had announced a new Divinity game, but because Vincke had made it clear that Larian had <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">been experimenting with using GenAI tools in its development process</a>.</p>



<p>Those comments came with considerable backlash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">to which Vincke responded fairly bluntly</a> before trying a more measured statement, but that did not stop players and other game developers in the industry who are entirely against the use of GenAI tools from hurling more vitriol towards Larian Studios. Game writers and some former Larian developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">even took the opportunity to pile on Larian more with the airing of grievances</a> around the studio's poor hiring practices and how it introduced GenAI in the first place.</p>



<p>Other members of the industry, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian</a>, but it seemed that Larian's critics would not be satisfied with anything short of Vincke entirely denouncing the use of GenAI tools and admitting he and the team were wrong to even try using them. To cap off his comments on the topic in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Vincke said "<em>a lot has been lost in translation</em>"</a> on the topic, and promised that he and the team would do a Reddit AMA to let players ask whatever questions they want to provide a clear and final word on the topic.</p>



<p>Well, that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA has been happening today</a>, and it should be no surprise that t<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">he first question was all about GenAI tools</a> and their role in Divinity's development, and within Larian Studios overall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Vincke was the one to answer it, and while he did not provide the answer that would satisfy the biggest GenAI critics, he did clear up one element of the studio's generative AI use.</p>



<p>"<em>So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity</em>," Vincke began. "<em>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</em> <em>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</em>"</p>



<p>But Vincke didn't stop there. While the studio will "<em>refrain from using genAI</em>" for concept art, other areas are still on the table, as a means of trying to speed up development where possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</em> <em>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own</em>."</p>



<p>In a follow-up question, Larian Studios' writing director <strong>Adam Smith</strong> confirmed that the approach to GenAI tools in concept art applies to writing as well, even when it comes to just using generative text as a placeholder. "<em>The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity</em>," Smith wrote.</p>



<p>"<em>To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'"- it doesn't. We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts - and there are a LOT of them - are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous. From the initial stub to the line we record and ship, there are a great many eyes and hands involved in getting a dialogue right.</em>"</p>



<p>So it's not the answer that the studio's biggest critics would like, but it's clear that the needle has moved on Larian Studios' use of GenAI. For now, the use of generative AI tools in game development will continue to be a controversial topic, whichever side of the aisle you're on.</p>
