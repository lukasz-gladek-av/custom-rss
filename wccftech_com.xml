			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display is problematic in a number of ways, and it's even worse than its predecessor's in certain scenarios, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Around two weeks after the system launched in most of the world, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared a two-hour-long review of the Nintendo Switch 2, going over every aspect of the system in great detail. Being the first Nintendo system to offer features that have become widely adopted in handheld devices since the launch of the original Switch, great attention has been reserved for the system's display, and the verdict is not good, as the display proved to be problematic in a number of ways. As already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">highlighted</a> earlier this month, HDR support is extremely disappointing, as an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range. Motion quality is possibly even more disappointing, as its blurring characteristics easily make the new system's panel worse than the original Switch's display. The difference in quality becomes even more evident when comparing the Nintendo Switch 2's display with the Switch OLED panel.</p>
<p>It's not just HDR and motion quality that disappoint in the Nintendo Switch 2 display, but also VRR support. There's reason to believe, however, that VRR support could be improved in the future, as Digital Foundry highlighted how Welcome Tour reveals support for LFC, low frame-rate compensation, which should improve the experience when hitting framerates outside the 40- 120Hz VRR window.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-large-scale-development-is-no-longer-sustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help.1225530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-best-ever/">Super Smash Bros. series</a> creator Masahiro Sakurai thinks that generative AI can help in a time when large-scale development has become unsustainable for various reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITmedia</a>, the creator of one of the most beloved Nintendo franchises ever made commented on the current game development landscape, saying that large-scale development is increasing in size, and is now time-consuming and unsustainable, so much so that Sakurai-san feels that things cannot continue the way they are. Game development has to change, and one of the solutions to this issue is using generative AI, which can be used to improve efficiency. Ultimately, according to Sakurai-san, we have reached an era where only companies that can adapt to this sustainability problem can survive.</p>
<p>While Masahiro Sakurai's statement could be interpreted as a full-on endorsement of the use of generative AI in game development, ResetERA forums member sprsk <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/#post-141809601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a bit of context related to the Japanese game development landscape. According to the user, the talent pool in Japan is getting smaller and smaller, and so there are not enough developers to sustain large-scale development, thus, using generative AI could help in a scenario where there are not enough developers. The user added that hiring from overseas could be a solution, but the language barrier will always be a problem, making it difficult to fill the gaps in talent in Japan this way.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a high-profile Nintendo developer, such as the Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, has commented on generative AI use in game development. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto weighed in on the matter, highlighting how Nintendo tends to go the opposite direction the industry as a whole goes, directly referencing the AI craze that is increasingly threatening jobs in game development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/3dsen-nes-emulator-brings-new-life-to-final-fantasy-dragon-quest/">3dSen NES emulator</a> has finally left early access after having been in development for 10 years, and its 1.0 release is now available for purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>The emulator is a passion project that reimagines classic NES games by turning them from 2D to playable 3D voxel dioramas. The improvements introduced to the supported games don't stop here, as the emulator introduced real-time lighting and shadows and animated skyboxes that breathe new life into some all-time classics. Unfortunately, the emulator doesn't yet support every NES game, but among the 100+ currently supported games are the Super Mario Bros. games, Contra, Metroid, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Duck Hunt, Mega Man, Castlevania, and others. The list of supported titles is constantly expanding thanks to the work of the <a href="https://itch.io/board/872690/profile-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community,</a> which is creating custom profiles using 3dSenMaker.</p>
<p>In case you have never seen the 3dSen emulator in action, you can check out the trailer below shared to celebrate its 1.0 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="3dSen Version 1.0 - Official Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_y2AE-kWtjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To further celebrate this important milestone, the 3dSen emulator is now available on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147940/3dSen_PC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Steam</a> with a 40% discount that will be available until June 26th, so make sure to take advantage of the offer if you're interested in what this impressive emulator has to offer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xenia-canary-team-not-working-xbox-classics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenia-canary-development-team-is-not-working-with-microsoft-on-the-xbox-classics-program.1225476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenia Canary development team is not working with Microsoft on the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/">Xbox Classics program</a>, the team itself confirmed in a new statement shared online.</p>
<p>As reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lhsg0m/xenia_team_post_official_response_about_rumoured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the development team of the Xbox 360 emulator confirmed on their official Discord server that they are not associated with Microsoft by any means, nor are they working with the company in any capacity. Microsoft uses its own emulation to deliver backward compatibility on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, the team added, and, as such, has no reason to collaborate with Xenia if they ever decide to bring their games to PC.</p>
<p>Though one may argue the Xenia Canary team could never confirm they are working on the Xbox Classics program under an NDA, if the team actually signed such an agreement, they would keep their silence on the matter, so at this point, there's no reason not to believe the developer's official statement. This doesn't mean that Microsoft isn't working on bringing classic Xbox games to PC and current consoles, but it also makes the rumor less credible, although the original leaker has doubled down on the matter, saying that such a program is indeed in the works and will be revealed next year to coincide with Xbox's 25th anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Snap, the digital collectible card game that's been live for nearly three years, has been accused of stealing art from the Japanese tokusatsu drama Kamen Rider Wizard. More specifically, users <a href="https://x.com/Tewakuumea/status/1933090847089979699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> that the art used for the Ancient One's magic shield is nearly identical, as you can see in the comparison below.</p>


<p>The original designer of Kamen Rider Wizard, which aired a total of 53 episodes between September 2012 and 2013, didn't take it very well. On their X account, they <a href="https://x.com/tajimax1968/status/1933479652292734983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oh my. I don't know this game, but this may be a huge rip-off. By the way, the dragon in the center is a PLEX design, and the outer circle surrounding it is all my own. The text is designed by my junior colleague and means a spell to gain power from magic stones. The text was written by K-kun from our literary team. Needless to say, everything is undoubtedly original.</em></p>
<p><em>As a designer, I find it distasteful. Above all, it is extremely disrespectful to fans of both characters. It ignores the original and is distributed and used as if it were originally this character's, which makes me feel angry and sad. Especially since I love MARVEL so much.</em></p>
<p>Griffin, the Community Manager of Marvel Snap, replied on the game's official Discord channel that the report is being 'investigated'. That was a while ago, however.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to the forefront of gaming news earlier this year due to the temporary TikTok ban enforced in the United States. At the time, the game was still published by Nuverse, which is owned by ByteDance, the same company behind TikTok.</p>
<p>The ban only lasted a couple of days, but later in January 2025, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner announced the decision to switch to Skystone Games, a US-based publisher.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In March 2021, Bellevue-based game development studio Hidden Path Entertainment (known mainly for Defense Grid and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-aaa-open-world-rpg-coming-from-hidden-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on a third-person open world AAA RPG based on the D&amp;D license. At the time, the developer was still recruiting for key roles, such as Graphics Programmer, Lead Graphics Programmer, Senior Technical Artist, and Writer.</p>
<p>It was an exciting project, as we had never had a true open world D&amp;D RPG. Unfortunately, the game never materialized. In January 2023, Dungeons and Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> several games, including a game in development at Otherside and Hidden Path's open world title. Intriguingly, at that time, Hidden Path denied that the project was already dead as they tried to find other funding sources.&nbsp;However, it ultimately had to resign itself in February 2024, when the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-open-world-rpg-from-hidden-path-is-officially-halted-as-developer-lays-off-44-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> 44 employees.</p>
<p>Although we may never play the game ourselves, we can now at least take a look at it. MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the portfolio of a former employee, which included several details and even some gameplay footage of a mission, which you can find embedded below.</p>

<p>The D&amp;D open world RPG was codenamed Project Dante. The gameplay seemed very similar to a regular third-person action RPG, with stealth mechanics on display as well. The player character was accompanied by two companions, as befitting a Dungeons &amp; Dragons title.</p>
<p>There's also an IMGUR gallery featuring concept art for the canceled game. You can browse it below.</p>

<p>Despite this cancellation, D&amp;D gaming fans have plenty of other projects to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a> (out this year)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooperative multiplayer game made by Starbreeze</a> and scheduled for 2026</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new game from Invoke</a> (the studio behind Dark Alliance)</li>
