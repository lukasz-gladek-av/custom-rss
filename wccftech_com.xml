			<p>After finding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-find-the-school-2f-stair-key-in-silent-hill-f-guide/">Ebisugaoka Middle School 2F Stair Key</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-open-the-secret-box-in-silent-hill-f-guide/">opening the Secret Box</a> in Silent Hill f, there is another puzzle for you to solve before you can leave the haunting building behind, involving opening one of the lockers on the first floor. Here's every combination to unlock every locker in the area.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: This guide is based on Hard puzzle difficulty.</em></strong></p>

<p>Finding every locker combination in Silent Hill f requires you to find multiple Origami of Grievances, where girls attending the school have written down the combinations. These clues, however, are written in a special code that can be understood by reading the explanation found in the northeastern corridor of the school's second floor. The key to the Locker Room on the first floor is found in the easternmost room of the same corridor.</p>



<h2 id="h-asakura-ayumi-locker-combination-mandatory">Asakura Ayumi Locker Combination (Mandatory)</h2>



<p>The combination to open this locker is <strong>865</strong>, the number code for Bus. This is the only locker you must open to proceed in the main story, as it contains the Cabinet Key to open the cabinet in the school's office on the first floor.</p>



<h2 id="h-aoi-takeshi-locker-combination-optional">Aoi Takeshi Locker Combination (Optional)</h2>



<p>The combination to open this locker is <strong>401</strong>, the number code for his name. It's the only locker located in the male locker room. Inside, you will find another Origami of Grievances to help you solve the puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-suga-yosie-locker-combination-optional">Suga Yosie Locker Combination (Optional)</h2>



<p>The combination to open this locker is <strong>505</strong>, the code for SOS. Inside, you will find an item that will increase your inventory space.</p>



<h2 id="h-tt-locker-combination-optional">TT Locker Combination (Optional)</h2>



<p>The combination to open this locker is <strong>377</strong>. Inside, you will find the Wolf Omamori, which increases damage dealt by weapons with high durability when equipped.</p>

			<p>Like its predecessors, Ninja Gaiden 4 will feature multiple difficulty settings, such as the accessible Hero mode and the challenging Master Ninja mode, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy the game's intense and bloody combat.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-livestream-forza-horizon-6/">today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast</a> provides the first look at these two difficulty modes. Hero mode, created to allow newcomers to the series and character-action games to enjoy the game's challenging experience, features different toggles for Auto Evade, Auto Block, and Auto Assist that allow players to build the foundation needed to switch to Normal or Hard mode without being overwhelmed by enemies. This foundation can also be built using the newly announced Training mode, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Master Ninja mode, on the other hand, will sit at the exact opposite end of the spectrum in terms of difficulty. The most challenging Ninja Gaiden 4 difficulty setting, which cannot be changed in-game once selected at the beginning of a playthrough, will require true skill to complete, with new enemy placements, late game enemies appearing earlier, and more aggressive enemy AI. </p>



<p>Hero difficulty mode and its toggles won't be the only accessibility options featured in Ninja Gaiden 4. On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/how-ninja-gaiden-4-curates-a-challenge-for-each-and-every-player/">Xbox Wire</a>, it was confirmed that the game will feature options such as disabling Hit Lag or Hit Stop, hiding the Lock-on Marker, Highlight Game Elements to free-hand recolor a wide range of objects, multiple controller options, including Left-handed Inverted Controls, and more.</p>

<p>While all of the newly revealed additions are quite welcome, based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">my experience with the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, the Master Ninja difficulty changes will be appreciated by fans of the genre looking for a real challenge, as regular enemies in the demo were mostly waiting around to be taken down quickly, instead of taking advantage of their greater numbers as they should have.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 launches on October 21 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in the successful racing series, is launching in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">previously teased by a reliable insider</a>, the sixth entry in the series was officially announced with a short announcement trailer shown during today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast. In development by both longtime series developer Playground Games and Turn10, the developers of the Forza Motorsport series, Forza Horizon 6 will bring players to Japan, the most-requested location since the series began.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Following the announcement trailer's release, a new post went up on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/">Xbox Wire</a>, where Art Director Don Arceta and Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita commented on the choice of setting. Besides being the most requested location from fans of the series, Japan has a unique culture that makes it perfect as a setting for an entry in the Forza Horizon series, thanks to how the country uniquely blends traditional buildings like shrines with modern buildings like workshops. The timing was also right, as current technology finally allows a proper representation of Japan.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will also take advantage of the Japanese setting in other interesting ways. The series' season change mechanics will be brought up to a new level in the game, as different seasons will have a dramatic impact on the landscape and playable world, according to Arceta. The new system will also truly inform the world, subtly changing activities and sound. This attention to detail will be evident in the entirety of the experience, with ambient audio that will instantly tell the player which season they are currently in.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is slated for a 2026 launch on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. More will be revealed in early 2026.</p>
