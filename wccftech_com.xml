			<p>The portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is estimated to be more powerful than the Xbox Series S but less powerful than the base PlayStation 5, and won't be able to run PS5 games as well as the original system does due to lower memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>Following up on some <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/">earlier comments</a> regarding the portable edition of the next-generation Sony console, known leaker Kepler L2 provided some additional information on the system on the NeoGAF forums. Asked about the system's power, the insider confirmed that, while it won't be as powerful as the base current-generation system, it will definitely be able to<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> run PS5 games</a>, although not at the same resolution and framerate, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth. Judging from this information, the leaker's assessment of the system's power, which will sit between the Xbox Series S and the base PlayStation 5, sounds accurate enough, although they <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> how it's difficult to estimate the system's performance due to it using an unreleased GPU architecture.</p>
<p>Speaking further about the portable PlayStation 6 SoC, the leaker confirmed it will be a different chip than the one powering the home console, designed to run at very low voltages, and that will feature <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270322851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot less than 40 compute units</a>, so likely less than the 36 featured by the base PlayStation 5's chip, although this doesn't tell us much without any additional information. This SoC will also tape out <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270323166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few months after the regular PlayStation 6 SoC</a>, so it may take a while longer for more information to come out.</p>
<p>While any edition of the PlayStation 6 has yet to be announced, we know that it will be powered by AMD like its two immediate predecessors. This wasn't a given, however, as Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">reportedly</a> bid to produce the system but ultimately lost to AMD. The system is expected to be released between 2027 and 2028.</p>

			<p>The long-rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is going to be shadowdropped in a few days, according to a very reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on yesterday's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb</a>'s GameBreaking News, reliable insider Jeff Grubb, who correctly provided information before official announcements multiple times in the past, provided an update on the rumored remake of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, saying that it will be shadowdropped next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Prices Increasing in Some Regions | GameBreaking News 04/14/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_ONk_GmF-Q?start=2238&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that the Oblivion remake&nbsp;<span>will be released towards the end of April. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, another reliable insider, NateTheHate, suggested that the game would be released close to April 21st, so at this point, there's a very high chance one of the worst-kept</span>&nbsp;gaming secrets of the year will indeed be released in a week or so.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake, or rather remaster as it was called at the time, was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">2023</a> during an FTC investigational hearing with Xbox head Phil Spencer. The game, however, was never acknowledged in any official capacity, and its scope has likely changed since its unofficial reveal, as it is said it will be a full-blown remake powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which will also include some gameplay changes besides improved visuals. Thankfully, it seems like it won't be long until we finally learn how the classic RPG will have been changed for its new release.</p>
