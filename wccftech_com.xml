			<p>Some may not remember it well now, but No Man's Sky had an utterly disastrous launch back in August 2016. After much hype, the released game proved quite disappointing to critics and fans alike. The Metascore average for the PC version is still <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/no-mans-sky/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting at just 61/100</a> (which is labeled as 'Mixed or Average' on Metacritic), and fans were also quite critical in their user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>One month after the game's debut, No Man's Sky was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mans-sky-investigation-uks-advertising-standards-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigated</a> by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority after many complaints from British customers. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-steam-page-not-mislead-consumers-asa-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared</a> of any wrongdoings on that count a few months later, but the mixed reception lingered.</p>
<p>Still, independent developer Hello Games embarked on a journey to deliver their true vision for the game. Year after year, they delivered dozens of major free updates, adding new features, content, and improvements in all areas, slowly winning back the respect and even admiration of gamers worldwide. In September 2021, five years after that fateful launch, No Man's Sky's overall user review score <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-has-finally-reached-mostly-positive-70-overall-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned</a> from 'Mixed' to 'Mostly Positive'.</p>
<p>Now, the game has reached another milestone, having finally moved from 'Mostly Positive' to 'Very Positive'. Game director Sean Murray, who also manages the official social media channels, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X:</p>
<p><em>Holy shit you guys - it happened ü•≥</em></p>
<p><em>ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive üòç</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you Thank you Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
<p><em>You have no idea what this means to us üôè</em></p>
<p>It must feel good to have come this far after that debut. There is little doubt that it's one of the most epic comebacks in the history of gaming, arguably alongside Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIV and CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, is that Hello Games has earned back the love of its fans, who continue to play No Man's Sky in ever greater numbers after every new update. The last one <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the long-awaited cross-save progression feature and also brought back Mass Effect's Normandy to celebrate N7 Day. The studio's engineers also impressed once again with their PS5 Pro implementation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> a stable 8K resolution mode at 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky continues to be updated at an impressive pace, following the incredible recovery of the game, fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also very eager</a> to discover more about the studio's next title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a>. This fantasy-themed game promises to be every bit as ambitious as the previous game, given the studio's goal to deliver a true planet-sized multiplayer sandbox roleplaying game.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends as a beginner, you'll see that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from. This includes ADC, Support, Jungler, Top and Mid. This guide will be walking you through some of the easiest Mid laners that you can play in League of Legends as a beginner. Being a Mid laner can be pretty daunting, as you are the most vulnerable lane out of the three. You have the possibility to be attacked from either side, whether it be laners or the jungler.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides here:</p>

<h2>Best Mid Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p><span><strong>Veigar</strong> is, of course, on the list. As long as you stack his Q against minions or even against champions, you'll get stacks and more damage very quickly. He also has great crowd control, as he has the potential to stun enemies with his E. Depending on how well you farm, Veigar has the potential to snowball and be a real threat, allowing him to one-shot enemies with his Ultimate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lux</strong> is another great mage to play and is one of the easiest champions to learn how to play. She is quite versatile and can also be played as a support. Compared to other champions, Lux has a relatively low cooldown on her Ultimate, making her a nightmare for the enemy team. However, she can be a bit difficult as both her Q and her Ultimate are skill shots that have the potential to miss.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Malzahar</strong> is a ton of fun, and once you get the farming technique down pat using his DoT, you have a lot of potential to earn plenty of gold and get the advantage over your opponent. His voidlings are great distractions, and he has some great crowd control. Once his damage has ramped up, his Ultimate can be a real threat, as it stuns the enemy and saps their health.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Annie</strong> is a great mid laner to learn if you're just getting started in League of Legends. Her abilities are easy to use, and her damage is simple and efficient. As long as you make sure to stack your shield properly so that your ability stuns, you have the potential to wipe out many opponents, especially if you use your stun-infused ability to summon Tibbers on top of the enemy.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the easiest Mid laners you can learn to play, and they are a ton of fun to play, too. They have a lot of potential to make you the team carry as long as you learn their kits.</p>
<p>Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>
