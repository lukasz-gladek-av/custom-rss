			<p>Yoko Taro, creator of Nier: Automata and one of the most prolific developers currently working in video games today, has, contrary to what many fans believe, been working on several video game projects since the release of Nier: Automata in 2017. We've just not been able to see any of the work he's been doing, because the projects he's been on have been cancelled before they made it to public viewing.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>), Yoko Taro set the story straight on what has become a sort of joke amongst his fans that he's not been working on games in recent years. He clarified that he's worked on several projects, though for reasons he did not or could not specify, they were cancelled before they could see the light of day.</p>



<p>"<em>I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren't you making a new sequel to NeiR' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released</em>."</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate, though unsurprising, reality of the modern video game industry that even a developer like Yoko Taro can be working in the industry for years and have nothing to show for it because the game never made it to launch and most unrevealed projects are locked behind NDA's and mountains of red tape that make it appear to the outside observer that you've been doing nothing for the better part of a decade.</p>



<p>He further clarifies that he doesn't feel negatively about the fact that he's not had a shipped game in years, and instead implies that he'd rather not put anything out if it's not going to be exactly right. "<em>I don't view that as a negative thing</em>," he continued. "<em>I believe that if I'm going to release something weird, I'd be better off not releasing anything at all.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-series-creator-yoko-taro-two-games-unsettling/">that we've had multiple reports</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">recent years regarding projects</a> Yoko Taro is working on. Now, it could be that some of those projects are the cancelled ones to which he refers to here, but regardless, it seems like Yoko Taro felt strongly enough about the idea that he's been sitting on his hands for years that he felt the need to explain why we've not seen anything he's worked on recently.</p>



<p>It seems like we'll just have to continue being patient and hope that at least one of the things he's working on will make it into the hands of players.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM is confident that its next flagship triple-A game, Resident Evil Requiem, won't suffer from the same performance issues that have plagued its previous big release, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>



<p>Today, the Japanese publisher <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a translated Q&amp;A</a> from the latest conference call for the first half<br>of the fiscal year. In the call, an investor specifically inquired about this topic and received the following response:</p>



<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features. At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed true that the two games are very different. One of the main selling points of the most recent Monster Hunter game was its open world-like hunting experience, but it was also clear that the RE Engine did not adapt very well to open worlds, as originally glimpsed in Dragon's Dogma 2, another open world game with significant performance problems. After an explosive launch, Monster Hunter Wilds sales slowed down considerably, and even an older game like Devil May Cry 5 managed to outsell it in the previous quarter. </p>



<p>The performance issue was so impactful, especially on PC, that CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to cancel a lecture on the game's technical features</a> after receiving harassment and threats from angry gamers. However, there's good reason to believe them about Resident Evil Requiem. While the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started as an open world title</a> with multiplayer features, it was eventually reworked as a single player game with smaller environments. In this scenario, the RE Engine has usually performed well enough, and there's no reason to believe that will change here. In fact, the developers were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleasantly surprised</a> at how well the game runs on the Nintendo Switch 2, the least powerful of all the supported platforms. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Q&amp;A, CAPCOM executives confirmed the publisher's goal to surpass initial sales of the previous franchise installment, Village, with Resident Evil Requiem. As a reminder, Resident Evil Village shipped three million units in the first four days, making it the third fastest-selling game in the survival horror series.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026. Read our Gamescom 2025 hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
