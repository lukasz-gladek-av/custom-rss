			<p>Koei Tecmo's only Nintendo Switch 2 launch game is NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, an improved version of the game that launched in July 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Awakening was the sixteenth installment in the popular series of turn-based grand strategy games. Ahead of that game's launch, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-preview-and-qa-with-director-ryu-michi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Koei Tecmo's producer and director Michi Ryu.</p>
<p>The Complete Edition (which will also be available on Sony's PlayStation 5 console) features DLC from the original title as well as six new scenarios along with climactic Decisive Battles. Players will be able to launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies while experiencing life as a daimyo in the troubled times of the Warring States Period (16th-century Japan).</p>
<p>With the game's debut scheduled for next week, we contacted Michi Ryu once again to discuss specifically the Nintendo Switch 2 version of NOBUNAGA’S&nbsp; AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition. The game will be available on June 5 as part of the Switch 2's launch lineup.</p>
<p><iframe title="NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvZG8Jiz7oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>I can't give you a concrete answer, so I'll leave it to your imagination (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>How long has this version been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose the exact timeframe, we had previously released the Nintendo Switch version, so porting to Nintendo Switch 2 was possible to achieve within a small team in a short period.&nbsp; Besides the porting, we have also worked on adding new hardware features and preparing game content updates, so overall, it took a considerable amount of time. Developing on this new platform feels the same as the Switch, which makes the process easier. However, there are always some challenges when launching a game (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>The platform has evolved in many ways. There are many interesting aspects, but in terms of strategy games, the possibility of being able to use the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse might be the most notable one. Although we think that using the controller to play is more than enough, it's undeniable that a mouse, which allows more intuitive control, is better suited for this genre. Being able to accomplish this through hardware features is a significant advantage.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>Since the "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION" series is not available on Xbox, we cannot make a comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using DLSS.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening&nbsp;was previously launched on the first Switch. What kind of improvements can players expect in the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is the experience of playing with the controller as a mouse similar to using the mouse on PC? What are the differences, if any?</strong></p>
<p>The mouse controls have been closely recreated. Although there are some differences between the hardware, such as assigning the mouse wheel to the stick, the functionality has been covered.<br>
Moreover, shortcuts have been assigned to the other Joy-Con 2, so the overall functionality might even surpass that of using a mouse alone.</p>
<p><strong>Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble in NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition?</strong></p>
<p>HD Rumble is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>The Nobunaga's Ambition series is a title that is a traditional Japanese game with a long history of over 40 years. This is the first time in the series that we are releasing a complete edition, and it's thanks to the positive reception of the latest title (NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening) and its steady sales. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has played it. And if you haven't tried it yet, I hope you'll take this chance to pick it up and try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-won%E2%80%99t-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake.1202592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal confirmed in a post on BlueSky</a> that he wouldn't be returning to reprise his role as Yosuke in the Persona 4 Remake, a project that had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">rumored</a> to be happening, but not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's claims that he potentially "<em>begged</em>" to be asked back and the fact that he deleted his original post made it look like Lowenthal had gone rogue, confirming his absence from the game as a small rebellious act against Atlus and SEGA.</p>
<p>But then a second actor, Erin Fitzgerald, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">confirmed her absence from the Persona 4 Remake</a> in a similar manner. Again, posting on BlueSky, Fitzgerald said, "<em>For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake. RIP. I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.</em>"</p>
<p>And now today, for a third day in a row, another Persona 4 voice actor has come out on social media to say that they will not reprise their role in the Persona 4 Remake. This time, it's Amanda Winn Lee, the only difference this time is that <a href="https://x.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293">she posted the news on X</a> instead of BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em><span>Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</span></em>."</p>
<p>The first time, it seemed like Lowenthal had gone rogue. Fitzgerald's post then opened up the possibility that the cast are all voicing their displeasure about not being asked back for the remake. That could still be true, but now that a third actor has come out and made the same claim, for a third day in a row, for a game that's not even officially confirmed, it's starting to feel like a marketing ploy ahead of the game's reveal, most likely next week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest.</a></p>
<p>A user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oscarexplosion.bsky.social/post/3lqefs2747226">BlueSky</a> also cleverly noticed that the order of these announcements also matches the order the characters each of these actors play are added to your party in Persona 4. If Matt Mercer is next to say that they weren't asked back to voice Kanji Tatsumi, with the same wording, then this has almost certainly all been a marketing ploy to build up awareness of the upcoming remake ahead of its official reveal.</p>
<p>The twist is probably that it's not called Persona 4 Remake, with the word 'Remake' swapped for something else, similarly to how the remake of Persona 3 was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and that instead of recasting everyone, the whole voice cast is indeed returning for whatever the remake is actually called.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will receive one more patch that will allow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users to play the game with mods.</p>
<p>As part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th anniversary celebrations</a> for the third entry in the series, CD Projekt Red confirmed today that the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game will get another patch later this year that will introduce cross-platform mod support across all three versions of the game. With this, creating, sharing, and enjoying mods will be easier and more accessible than ever with a shared modding ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the announcement above, CD Projekt Red shared an FAQ on the official <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt website</a>, providing additional details on how cross-platform mod support will work. A mod.io account connected to a CD Projekt Red account will be needed to access cross-platform mod support, but modders won't be limited to using only mod.io, as mods shared via Nexus Mods and the Steam Workshop will continue to work with the game. Console players, on the other hand, will only be able to access mods via mod.io. In addition, not every mod released for the PC version of the game will be available on consoles, although even those created without using the official REDkit modding tools have the chance of being released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S if they follow Fan Content Guidelines and CD Projekt Red User Agreement.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Cross-platform mod support will be available later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-the-most-overpowered-character-to-use-to-beat-most-bosses-easily-even-solo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-the-most-overpowered-nighfarer-to-use-to-beat-most-bosses-easily-even-solo.1202487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-the-most-overpowered-character-to-use-to-beat-most-bosses-easily-even-solo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unlike base Elden Ring, where the differences between classes are minimal in the long run, the eight Nightfarers available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> are quite different from one another, coming with some unique skills and traits that make them better suited for certain playstyles.</p>
<p>While every Nightfarer is more than viable to defeat the powerful Nightlords awaiting them at the end of each run, one of them has some clear advantages over the others, so much so that a team of three of the same one can make very short work of most Nightlords, even if the random generation of upgrades hasn't worked in the players' favor the previous two days. This Nightfarer is <strong>Ironeye</strong>.</p>
<p>On paper, a ranged fighter like Ironeye doesn't inspire much confidence, but the mechanics that made ranged-exclusive playstyles more limited in the original Elden Ring and every other entry in the Souls series are gone in Elden Ring Nightreign. Bows and crossbows have <strong>infinite ammo</strong>, allowing their wielders to spam long-range attacks as long as they have stamina. And in a game where you are constantly swarmed by a great number of enemies, this is extremely beneficial, as it gives you the chance to better control crowds while staying out of danger.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528130002_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The above, however, isn't the only reason why Ironeye is so good in Elden Ring Nightreign at launch that he can take on Nightlords even solo and win. His Character Skill and Ultimate Art, <strong>Marking</strong> and <strong>Single Shot</strong>, are among the best in the entire game. The first is a quick lunging slash with plenty of invincibility frames that marks hit enemies, exposing their weak points. Once the weak points have been destroyed, the enemy will be staggered and open to a critical hit. The second is a powerful arrow that hits in a wide radius, knocks the vast majority of enemies down, even some bosses, and can bring back to life downed companions in a single hit, all the while making Ironeye invincible for the entire duration of the attack. Both abilities can be used both offensively and defensively to get out of a sticky situation and deal tons of damage, and the very quick cooldown of Marking allows Ironeye to see it very often.</p>
<p>Ironeye's weapon of choice, the bow, also works great in conjunction with ailments like <strong>poison, frostbite, and scarlet rot</strong>, which are extremely powerful in Elden Ring Nightreign as much as they were in the base Elden Ring at launch. A bow with the <strong>Barrage</strong> skill and the ability to inflict status ailments is invaluable, as you can inflict the affliction much more quickly using the skill. Even when using a weapon with no elemental or affliction property, Barrage works great with the Marking skill and builds that improve critical hits. To increase your chances of being able to use this strategy, pinpoint locations on the map showing the status alterations icon and defeat the bosses there. These locations have a higher chance of weapons with the related affinity being offered as rewards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Limveld, Ironeye may not be an enticing choice over other Nightfarers, but give him a chance, and you will be surprised by how good he is. Parties of multiple Ironeyes can destroy most bosses, while solo, he will allow you to enjoy the game more, as he has an easier time dealing with the gameplay elements that make solo play very challenging to the point of frustration. During the review period, I played solo rather often, and my only successful runs were with Ironeye. Not only did I almost always get the final day to fight the Nightlord, but I also managed to defeat Gladius and Maris without the help of any player, while also getting very close to defeating a few of the other Nightlords. It's still no walk in the park, to be sure, but considering the high challenge level and how much melee characters struggle in a lot of different situations, Ironeye does make Elden Ring Nightreign a little more manageable, no matter the situation.</p>
