			<p>We're now officially less than a year from the release date of GTA VI, provided that there are no further delays, that is. Even GTA V modders are starting to look with anticipation at Rockstar's massively anticipated sequel; Razed, the creator of the stunning <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-natural-vision-enhanced-mod-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NaturalVision visual overhaul mod</a> for Grand Theft Auto V, has discussed the upcoming game's modding potential <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/according-to-steam-i-have-around-10-000-hours-logged-says-the-modder-whos-spent-a-decade-turning-gta-5-into-a-photo-realistic-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><em>I think modding is going to be bigger than ever once GTA VI eventually drops on PC. I'm hopeful Rockstar will give players official tools to mod the game, especially with the direction they're heading with FiveM. There's a ton of potential here. Imagine if they took a page out of Bethesda's playbook and introduced a proper marketplace for user-generated content. It could benefit both mod creators and Rockstar in a big way. I'd like to see something like that happen.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd love to create mods for GTA VI, but it still feels a little too early to get into the specifics of what that might look like. Honestly, I don't think visual overhaul mods will be in high demand this time around. The game already looks incredible. If anything, I think I'd really enjoy making content for people to use on their custom servers, like exterior map packs or custom interiors.</em></p>
<p>Razed was referring to the popular FiveM roleplaying servers that Rockstar originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-bans-users-affiliation-fivem-gta-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a> and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a>. It is indeed likely to see them playing a major role in Grand Theft Auto VI, at least on PC. There was even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> recently that Rockstar was indeed looking to place a much bigger focus on Roblox-style user-generated content.</p>
<p>Of course, PC gamers will have to wait longer to actually play the game, although the CEO of Corsair Gaming previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it could be just a few months rather than a full year before the PC version is released. For PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, GTA VI is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to debut on May 26, 2026</a>.</p>

			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced the cancellation of two projects: Project Gemini and Project Bifrost.</p>
<p>People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1929140540697727466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> the news earlier today on X:</p>
<p><em>Today, we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of Project Gemini and Project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market. The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</em></p>
<p><em>Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project. As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most. We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point.</em></p>
<p>Project Gemini was being developed for publisher Square Enix and already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-removes-30-developers-from-unannounced-square-enix-game-project-gemini-to-shrink-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a shrunken scope and the layoff of 30 developers in early 2024. People Can Fly had previously worked with Square Enix on Outriders. As for Project Bifrost, it was slated to be the last Virtual Reality game made by the studio, as they recognized that there wasn't enough of a market for VR yet.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, People Can Fly had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-dagger-action-adventure-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Project Dagger, a new IP in the action/adventure genre that would have been published by Take-Two. Even with all these failed projects, the Polish team is still working <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Gears of War: E-Day for Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another unknown game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>
