			<p>In late April, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release date of Ghost of Yōtei. The sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima will be released on October 2, 2025, for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that it's one of the most anticipated games of the year. After all, its predecessor was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excellent action/adventure game</a> that also set a new sales record for PlayStation 4's first-party debut. The superb reception pushed Sony to fast-track not only a sequel but also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie adaptation</a> that will be directed by John Wick's Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Can Ghost of Yōtei meet&nbsp;<span>fans' lofty expectations, though?&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to the French website PlayStation Inside</a>, former head of PlayStation Studios Shuhei Yoshida revealed that he played the game, and fans can be assured that </span>it'll be even better than the first installment.</p>
<p><em>In the case of Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch worked extensively with a Japanese producer at SIE, as well as colleagues at Japan Studio. This was a great help to the studio because the developers could show them their ideas and these Japanese people would tell them internally whether or not they were respectful of Japan and correct. The teams also visited Tsushima Island and made a real effort to immerse themselves in its history and traditions. They managed to capture the island’s unique atmosphere, which can be felt in the game, for example in the wind system, and I think that’s why it’s so successful. The game has even boosted tourism on Tsushima Island, which says a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>So, if you want to sell well in Japan, especially when you’re making a game about Japan, it’s important to have a development process that seeks to understand the country throughout. Ghost of Tsushima felt incredible to play, and having played Ghost of Yotei at several stages of its development, I can assure you that it will be even better and that Sucker Punch has done it again!</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch date news, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> new details about this new game. The developers said this is their biggest world with the greatest amount of player freedom. The campaign where protagonist Atsu seeks her revenge will be non-linear, meaning that players can take on the Yōtei Six (who killed Atsu's family) in any order.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-mandate-generative-ai-usage-for-its-gaming-studios-confirms-south-of-midnight-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Microsoft has been betting heavily on generative AI ever since its early investments in OpenAI. Even on the gaming front, they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Inworld AI</a> to create a generative AI powered game development tool called Narrative Graph.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/compulsion-games-boss-says-internal-xbox-studios-aren-t-facing-generative-ai-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Game Developer</a> during the recent Gamescom LATAM, Compulsion Games founder and studio head Guillaume Provost revealed that Microsoft is not forcing its usage on Xbox Game Studios.</p>
<p><em>I can absolutely guarantee that generative AI usage is not mandated. You're talking to the studio that literally builds shit by hand. In the DNA of the studio that we have, we're very craft oriented. We're very art oriented. Just based on the types of games that we make, I would say we are probably not the studio that will use AI the most, and I don't think that bothers anything at Microsoft. The DNA of our studio is to handcraft things and to make them feel handcrafted, and that involves a lot of manual labor.</em></p>
<p>Provost later admitted that generative AI could still prove useful even for Compulsion's approach to development.</p>
<p><em>I think there are a lot of cases where it could be helpful in pre-production for us to do things like spitting out storyboards for us to see whether it makes sense or not— not really stuff that we use in production, but stuff that we want to accelerate.</em></p>
<p>Compulsion Games recently released the&nbsp;<span>single-player action/adventure game South of Midnight. In another interview&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/south-midnight-sales-milestone-1-million-players-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game Rant</a>, Provost confirmed that the game had already reached over a million players. Granted, its availability on the Microsoft owned subscription service Game Pass certainly helped a great deal</span>. However, it's still a fairly important milestone for the Montreal-based developer previously known for Contrast and We Happy Few.</p>
<p>South of Midnight received a 7/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by David Carcasole:</p>
<p><em>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tetrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada.1181586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roaring-kitty-is-apparently-back-to-his-gamestop-pumping-ways/">GameStop</a> has sold its Canadian branch, GameStop Canada, to French-Canadian entrepreneur and McFarlane Toys co-owner Stephan Tetrault, who has also confirmed that the retailer will re-launch as Electronics Boutique Canada Inc., or EB Games Canada.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1891884823465103698">announced back in February</a> that he was looking to sell the Canadian division of the company, telling interested parties to email GameStop's mergers and acquisitions division, saying "<em>High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stephan-tetrault-acquires-gamestop-canada-302446106.html">press release</a> regarding the acquisition, Tetrault says, "<em>This isn't just a business decision - it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved. We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gamestop-selling-canadian-assets-ceo-wokeness-dei-1.7462542">The Canadian Press</a> put the number of Canadian GameStop stores at 203, though that was before GameStop <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/26/gamestop-close-significant-number-locations-report/">confirmed it would be shutting down</a> more of its locations worldwide, Canada included. The press release for today's acquisition puts the current number at "<em>over 185</em>" locations.</p>
<p>"<em>We want EB Games Canada to be more than a store,</em>" adds GameStop Canada president Jim Tyo. "<em>We want it to be the hub for gaming and fandom culture across Canada. This is about passion, and that's what's going to drive every decision we make</em>."</p>
<p>The transition from GameStop Canada to EB Games Canada will begin across the country in the coming months, including new store signage, a new website, and new branding across all social platforms. Canadians will surely have whiplash over the change since many remember that it wasn't too long ago that <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8066111/gamestop-eb-games-canada-rebrand/">GameStop sunsetted&nbsp;the EB Games branding in Canada</a>, with every EB Games becoming a GameStop.</p>
<p>Gamers have been lamenting the poor practices that GameStop perpetuates and how the stores have begun to sell more toys and Pop Funkos than games. It'll be interesting to see how Tetrault tries to turn things around, and if he can bring more gamers back to the retail store after many have turned their backs on buying from GameStop for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ecco The Dolphin And Ecco: The Tides Of Time Remasters And A New Third Ecco Game Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced.1181547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
