			<p>NetEase made waves in all the wrong ways when it decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lay off developers</a> at its Western Marvel Rivals studio despite the fact that the game was an absolute smash hit with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 40 million players to date</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a fresh report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Bloomberg</a> alleges that the Chinese company suffered many abrupt changes mandated by its founder and CEO, William Ding, who cut hundreds of jobs and suddenly pulled back its massive foreign investment. As a reminder, over the last few years, NetEase has invested in many studios based in North America, Europe, and Japan, such as:</p>

<p>Of these, Jar of Sparks and Worlds Untold already had their funding cut by NetEase a few months ago, and the heads are now desperately looking for another publisher and source of funding. Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was also shut down</a> despite the game's launch to positive reviews. And now, other Japanese studios like Nagoshi's have just been given the time required to complete current projects. There won't be any additional funding or time allotted by NetEase, and the Chinese publisher has no plans to spend any money on marketing or promoting the games currently in production in Japan.</p>
<p>Other NetEase-backed Western studios on that list are also reportedly seeking new publishers, including Jackalyptic, which is making a Warhammer MMORPG (which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to Jack Emmert</a> about after its announcement). This game was recently shown at a trade event to partners and received a positive response, so there's hope it will find a new home.</p>

			<p>Despite having debuted 11 months ago on the market, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold extremely well last month in the United States thanks to its PC release, further highlighting how damaging exclusivity can be.</p>
<p>According to new sales data shared today by Circana (NPD), the second entry in the Remake trilogy, which launched on PC late <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">last month</a>, was the third best-selling premium game in the United States, right after two huge sellers like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Madden NFL 25. The massive jump in rank of both the standalone game, going from rank 56 to 3, and of the Twin Pack also including Remake, from rank 265 to 16, strongly highlights how well the game sold on PC, despite a port that, while much better than that of the previous entry in the series, still leaves something to be desired, especially in terms of performance.</p>

<p>No matter the platform, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that any JRPG fan should definitely experience, as it features an amazing recreation of the remainder of the original's disc one that brings everything good that Remake did to new heights, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>
