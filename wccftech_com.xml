			<p>Out of Valve's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three hardware announcements made on Wednesday</a>, the Steam Machine was undoubtedly the one that got people the most excited. Sure, Valve already tried and failed ten years ago, but the successful hardware launches of the Valve Index and, especially, the Steam Deck have proven Gabe Newell's company can do hardware really well. </p>



<p>One of the main changes compared to the previous Steam Machine iteration is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will feature a large selection of games</a>. However, Valve also needs to make sure <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the device has competitive pricing</a> while still delivering decent performance. In that regard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with Adam Savage</a>, Hardware Engineer Yazan Aldehayyat claimed the new console-like platform is comparable to or better than 70% of the user rigs registered in the Steam survey.</p>



<p><em>Well, there's looking at it from two different directions, right? The first one is that it needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games. That was really important to us. We want it to be a pretty simple experience. You don't have to worry about, oh, I play these games. I don't know if it has enough performance to play these games. That was the first hurdle: we needed to make sure that there's enough performance in the Steam Machine that you don't have to worry about that.</em></p>



<p><em>But we also kind of wanted to target more of an entry-level device. We understand that affordability is really important, right? The price point definitely plays a huge factor into what performance level we're trying to target. Essentially, we kind of used those two directions to triangulate what we think makes the most sense. Another thing that we actually looked at is just the Steam hardware survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. That's also another way to think about it where we kind of arrive at that performance level.</em></p>



<p>Still, based on the specs revealed so far, the hardware's performance could fall between that of the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5, so don't expect anything extraordinary, especially <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-new-steam-machine-packs-just-8-gb-vram-is-that-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given the 8 GB VRAM</a>. In the video interview, Aldehayyat also confirmed that Valve did not bother to tune any of the silicon, using an 'off-the-shelf' chip. They did, however, customize the 'firmware and software bits' so that the Steam Machine would be optimized for the SteamOS environment.</p>



<p>With the platform slated to launch in early 2026, it shouldn't be too long before Valve provides more details, such as the final price.</p>

			<p>A new Frame Generation mod for Fallout 4 was released yesterday <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. As you probably remember, modder PureDark released Frame Generation mods for Bethesda's open world RPG, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-dlss-3-mod-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for NVIDIA DLSS</a> and then for AMD FSR, over two years ago. However, PureDark's mods are still locked behind the paywall of having to be a Patreon subscriber of his.</p>



<p>This mod, on the other hand, is completely free of charge. Created by doodlum, the main coder behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite, it is the modder's second submission after <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-gets-perfect-skies-graphics-mod-long-15-quest-mod-due-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies for Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 2025 Modathon</a>, a Nexus Mods competition among modders that started on October 23 (Fallout Day) and ends on December 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Doodlum's Fallout 4 Frame Generation mod is powered by AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology, more specifically through the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available</a> AMD FidelityFX SDK GPUOpen API, and thus uses a DLL signed by AMD. It works through a custom-made DirectX 12 swap chain proxy and is compatible with any DirectX 12-capable graphics card, which is not surprising given that it relies on AMD FSR 3.</p>



<p>The modder says Frame Generation can smooth performance in the most demanding scenarios, such as in cities. Moreover, mods like the popular Sim Settlements 2 can further increase the CPU load, making Frame Generation even more important. You can view a brief video comparison between Fallout 4 vanilla and with this mod installed below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>By default, the mod only enables itself when detecting monitors with a refresh rate of at least 120Hz; however, users can force it to be enabled in the .ini file.</p>



<p>The mod requires Address Library for F4SE Plugins and High FPS Physics Fix, and also for you to set Fallout 4 to Borderless or Windowed mode in the game's launcher. It is compatible with ENB and also with PureDark's free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 upscaler mod</a>, provided you set the latter to DLAA or native AA. It does not, however, work with the VR version of the game, though that's not an issue since VR's spacewarp already provides a similar and more effective frame generation technique.</p>



<p>Fallout 4 just celebrated its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its original launch</a> with the release of a new Anniversary Edition (which broke a lot of mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting some users to revert to the previous version</a>). In other Fallout news, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> both a Fallout 3 and a Fallout: New Vegas remaster are in the works at Bethesda.</p>
