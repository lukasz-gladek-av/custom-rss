			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/nintendo-says-demand-for-switch-2-console-in-japan-overwhelming?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report, analysts are expecting Nintendo to have &nbsp;6-8 million <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> units on hand for its June 5 launch. This would make it one of the biggest console launches in the video game industry's history.</p>
<p>Coming into 2025, everyone expected the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 to be one of the most significant events of the year. Demand for the Switch 2 has even exceeded Nintendo's expectations. In Japan alone, Nintendo received 2.2 million applications from consumers looking to grab a Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had to take to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">X</a> to formally apologize to players that "<em>a significant number of applicants won't be selected</em>" because the demand exceeded expectations. Bloomberg's report also notes that Nintendo is doing what it can to increase console production to meet the demand as best it can by June 5.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 only went live in the United States and Canada today, after having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed</a> due to tariffs announced by the U.S. Consumers looking to lock in their pre-orders<a href="https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1915257488703705328?s=46"> reported</a> that websites for retailers like Best Buy and Walmart crashed due to the overwhelming flood of traffic. The outages weren't too bad overall, as many people were still gleefully announcing they had grabbed a pre-order.</p>
<p>While the price of the Switch 2 and its games remains controversial for players, those who could grab a pre-order or buy it on day one are likely getting a better deal than those who choose to wait. Tariffs still loom over the console's pricing like a dark cloud, and we've already seen them impact the Switch 2, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">increased the price</a> of several Switch 2 accessories as a response to tariffs.</p>
<p>The price of the console has stayed the same for now, but Nintendo stipulated that it could still increase in the future, "<em>depending on market conditions</em>."</p>

			<p>Developer Heart Machine's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched at the top of the year in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Early Access</a>, and the studio has officially announced that its first major update, Buried Below, will arrive on <strong>April 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding what's new in the update, a new Breaker called Rondo will be added to the game, who comes with a new SyCom with two perks, a new crown called Maw, two new melee weapons, and new environments to run through, such as caves.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The rest of the major changes are quality-of-life updates and significant changes to the run structure. In a press release, Heart Machine calls it "<em>the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game's run structure</em>."</p>
<p>Players will now have one life per run, losing items in their inventory and resetting the Overgrowth when they die. Heart Machine says this change will allow the team to "better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into<em>&nbsp;but harder to master</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Along with this change comes a few new gameplay loops, including introducing more ways for players to leave the Overgrowth, SyComs following more of a class-like system with character customization being redesigned, and streamlining vendors and player inventory.</p>
<p>The final significant aspect of the update is an improved onboarding path. Once the update is live, first-time players will be thrown into a tutorial that will take them through the game's core mechanics and explain a few key aspects they'll need to know with Hyper Light Breaker. Heart Machine hopes that this new tutorial will be useful to first-time players and even returning players who may just want a refresher on the basics.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As part of the new update being revealed, Heart Machine is providing Wccftech 20 game keys to giveaway beginning&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, May 7, 2025</strong>, a week after the update will have gone live. Make sure to follow Wccftech's and Heart Machine's social channels to be prepared for the giveaway so you don't miss it.</p>
