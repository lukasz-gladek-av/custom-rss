			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the popular stealth series, is launching in late August on PC and consoles, according to a new finding.</p>
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/concept/10007293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Store listing</a> was updated today with an August 28th release date which is also confirmed by a<a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new trailer</a> that is currently only available on the PlayStation Store. With the trailer now out in the wild, it shouldn't take much longer for it to be released on YouTube and the release date to be officially confirmed. The trailer also teases that the Snake vs Monkey mini game will also make a return.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is setting out to be an extremely faithful remake that will allow players to experience the epic Operation Snake Eater. Despite aiming to be a faithful recreation of the original, the remake will still come with some new features over the original, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">a new control scheme</a>, a modernization improvement that was somewhat required by the improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5. At the same time, the game features very few changes, as series producer Noriaki Okamura still wants long-time fans to feel nostalgic while playing the game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 28th worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has just <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?e0a6b1252ea06e64c499d35782726646a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> an official rating from the South Korean GRAC, the Game Rating and Administration Committee. The game has been vetoed for minors, with the following summary of its content:</p>
<p><em>An adventure game about delivering parcels across a post-apocalyptic world and connecting cities to save humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>＊ Excessive violence</em><br>
<em>- There is red blood and bodily harm during combat using weapons during the game.</em><br>
<em>＊ Excessive vulgar language, profanity, and swearing</em><br>
<em>- There is excessive vulgar vulgarity and swearing during the game (f＊＊k, a＊＊h＊＊e, s＊＊t, d＊＊n, h＊＊ys＊＊t, etc.)</em><br>
<em>＊ Direct drug use</em><br>
<em>- Smoking and drinking scenes are depicted during the game.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, according to Article 21 of the Act on Promotion of the Game Industry and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Rating Classification Regulations, it has been rated as 'Not available to minors'.</em></p>
<p>What fans will be interested in, though, is the mere fact that it was rated. Usually, this means the game is close to its launch window. Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-rated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> in late March and subsequently launched in late August, but there were cases where the rating only appeared around three months before the game's release date. As such, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach might be coming within the first half of the year. A release date could be announced at the upcoming State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-playstation-state-of-play-presentation-is-set-for-february-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to take place next week</a>.</p>
<p>It's not that surprising, considering that creator Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-has-entered-adjustment-phase-voice-acting-and-motion-capture-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> back in May 2024 that the game had already entered the 'adjustment phase', with voice acting and motion capture already done. Fans got an <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended look at the sequel</a> at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, where Kojima showed some of the new characters, such as Rainy (played by Shioli Kutsuna, previously seen in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine and The Invasion), Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning, known for Super 8, Maleficent, and The Great), Dollman (played by Jonathan Roumie, mainly known for playing Jesus in The Chosen), and Heartman (played by Darren Jacobs, who was featured in Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver). Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker are returning as Sam Porter Bridges, Fragile, and Higgs. Players will also find the likenesses of Mad Max creator George Miller and In The Shade director Fatih Akin.</p>
<p>Just like the first game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been made with Guerrilla's Decima Engine. It will launch on PlayStation 5 first, though there's a solid chance it will make it not only on PC like the first one but even on Xbox, following Kojima Productions' <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent acquisition of the IP from Sony</a>.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a well-optimized game, so much so that the most powerful GPU now available on the market, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">NVIDIA RTX 5090</a>, can run the game at 16K resolution and playable framerates with the help of DLSS.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zWORMzGaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zWORMz Gaming</a> shows the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios running at 16K resolution, low settings, and NVIDIA DLSS at the Performance setting, meaning it is upscaled from 8K resolution. Despite not running at native resolution, it is still impressive to see the RTX 5090 handle such a high resolution relatively well, as the above 30 FPS the GPU can deliver makes the game more than playable. Unsurprisingly, the RTX 5090 is not capable of handling Kingdom Come: Deliverance II running at native 16K resolution, as it only delivers a proper slideshow experience with a whopping 3 FPS gameplay.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II isn't only among the most well-optimized games of recent times, it is also a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, as Chris highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI is close to making its debut on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but its release on Nintendo Switch 2 remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetERA forums, NateDrake, a.k.a. NatheTheHate, who proved to be a very reliable source in the past, recently revealing precisely when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">Nintendo Switch 2 would get officially unveiled last month</a>, said that, barring any late changes, Final Fantasy XVI will<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> soon be announced for Xbox consoles</a>, and will be released around the mid-first half of the year, so around Spring. Final Fantasy VII Remake will also be released on Xbox consoles <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later this year</a>, and Rebirth next year. The Xbox release of all three games will be announced at the same time for maximum impact, according to the insider.</p>
<p>While Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S owners will soon be able to finally experience Final Fantasy XVI, Nintendo Switch 2 owners, on the other hand, may never get the chance. According to NateDrake, the game is<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135347844" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> not planned</a> for the next Nintendo console at this time, as Square Enix decided to prioritize Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth for the console. Considering how the game has trouble running with decent performance on PlayStation 5 and even on certain PC configurations, it wouldn't be surprising if not getting the game out on much weaker hardware was due to technical reasons.</p>
<p>Of the three Final Fantasy games mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the latest. Launched last year on PlayStation 5 and last month on PC, it is among the best entries in the entire franchise to date, and a massive step forward from Remake, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
