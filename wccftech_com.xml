			<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia, developed by Evil Empire and published by Ubisoft, has surprise-launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles today during Gamescom 2025, with a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 launch to come sometime later this year.</p>



<p>It's also dropped on Xbox Game Pass, so players who have a Game Pass subscription and have yet to check out the game since its Early Access launch last year can jump into the action without making an extra purchase.</p>

<p>The news was unveiled during Xbox's Gamescom 2025 live stream, and though it is still technically a shadow-drop, it's not that much of a surprise since Ubisoft previously revealed an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">"<em>August 2025</em>" launch window for the game's 1.0 version this past June</a>.</p>



<p>The game has come a long way since its early access launch in May 2024, but even at that launch, it already looked like an impressive 2D action game that fans of the roguelite genre wouldn't want to miss. This, again, isn't all that surprising considering it was developed by the same team that worked on Dead Cells.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed the early access version</a> of The Rogue Prince of Persia last May, he wrote "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite."</em></p>

			<p>After debuting our first look at gameplay for the '80s-looking isometric horror action game, I Hate This Place, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-gameplay-trailer-debut/">just last month</a>, developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games have announced that I Hate This Place will land on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this coming <strong>November 7, 2025</strong> as part of this week's Gamescom 2025 festivities.</p>



<p>The release date trailer shows off even more gameplay and more of the '80s aesthetic that makes the game stand out in the crowd of isometric games available on the market today. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>I Hate This Place is a debut title for both its developer and publisher. It's Broken Mirror Games' first title after being founded in 2024, and it's the first game that publisher Skybound Games is working on since the publisher was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-announces-partnership-with-skybound-entertainment-developing-a-new-title-by-2025/">Bloober Team at the end of 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Even though we've just seen a few trailers at this point, it already looks like it is shaping up to be one hell of a debut game. And if you're in attendance at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be able to put that theory to the test, since you can head over to the studio's booth in Arena Hall 10.1, Stand A:044 to check out I Hate This Place and play it for yourself.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 20/08/2025:</strong> Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter) spotted that Best Buy has already listed the prices for the ROG Xbox Ally and the Xbox Ally X, confirming the prices leaked by Billbil-kun below. Pre-orders are not yet live, but should be any moment, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/">Billbil-kun already reported that they would go live today.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has announced the official release date for the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X at Gamescom 2025, which will officially launch this coming October 16, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced during Xbox's first day of livestreaming during this year's Gamescom, but it's not news for anyone that's been paying attention to the ROG Xbox Ally, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">Billbil-kun from Dealabs leaked the release date last week</a>.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun even leaked the prices, though Xbox has yet to confirm them at the time of this writing. Earlier today,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social/post/3lwt47zevds24"> in a Bluesky post</a>, they claimed the US prices would be <strong>$549.99 </strong>for the ROG Xbox Ally and <strong>$899.99</strong> for the ROG Xbox Ally X. Billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">leaked the European prices last month</a>.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Inside the ROG Xbox Ally: Game Access and Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Gamescom live stream also went over a few details for the Ally, like the fact that it will come with Microsoft's Co-Pilot for Gaming built in, and that games will carry a performance tag similar to what Valve has for the Steam Deck. Instead of something being 'Ally verified' or not, games will carry one of three tags telling players what kind of performance they can expect.</p>



<p>If the game in question has been tested and can hit at least 30FPS on the ROG Xbox Ally, it'll get a "<em>Should perform well on this device</em>" tag. If it has been tested and can hit at least 60FPS, it'll have a "<em>Should perform great on this device</em>" tag. If it's not been tested, it'll have a "<em>Performance check not available yet</em>" tag.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Handheld Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQiwumMYsGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding that testing, Xbox also introduced its Handheld Compatibility Program, which is "<em>a new Xbox initiative designed to make more games ready to play on your supported handheld</em>,"<em> </em>according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/">Xbox Wire post</a>. Xbox has been working with studios to test "<em>thousands of games for handheld compatibility,"</em> to ensure they're ready for players picking up an Ally this coming October.</p>



<p>It's nice to see the release date get an official confirmation, even if the news was spoiled before Xbox got the chance to shout it out itself. Hopefully, we'll have the prices confirmed soon. </p>
