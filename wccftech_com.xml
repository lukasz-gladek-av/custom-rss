			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar Games producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/">Leslie Benzies</a>, isn't exactly having the best launch. Even before the game launched, it wasn't having a good lead-up to release.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two chief executives at Build A Rocket Boy left the studio</a> a week before the game was due to release. The last major <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">trailer ahead of launch</a>, instead of getting people excited about the game, brought even more eyes to the game in a negative way, after early previews were less-than-enthusiastic. It also didn't help that the co-chief executive officer of the studio was claiming that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">anyone who had something negative to say about MindsEye was being paid to be negative</a>.</p>
<p>Then, less than a week before launch, physical copies of the game started to appear in the wild as retail stores broke street date. The studio warned players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">the game on the disc would be missing a "<em>major</em>" day-one patch</a>, but that warning didn't do much to quell players' concerns that the day-one patch would fix all the issues those who had early copies were already seeing.</p>
<p>Now, the game is out, and on PC, we're already seeing that it's poorly optimized on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">only capable of hitting 60FPS at 4K, even with the beefiest of machines</a>, if NVIDIA's DLSS and Frame Generation technology are enabled. On consoles, things aren't much better, with the game being unable to hit 60FPS at all, and capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>And it's that last point that is causing PlayStation to give players refunds for their purchase of MindsEye. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mindseye-players-refunds-playstation-5-ps5-like-cyberpunk-2077/">TheGamer</a>, a player on PlayStation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">was given a refund for their purchase</a> when they pointed out to PlayStation Support that MindsEye was marketed as being playable on PS5 Pro at 60 FPS through a Pro-Enhanced mode. That's not the case, and a refund is being granted.</p>

<p lang="en">PlayStation is allowing refunds for MindsEye www.thegamer.com/mindseye-pla...</p>
<p>â€” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed">Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lrfz6kzjqj2l?ref_src=embed">2025-06-12T13:19:55.498Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It's also not the only reason players are getting refunds, as <a href="https://x.com/WolfgangMishima/status/1932506058116759710">WolfgangMishima on X</a> was issued a refund for issues they had with the game, while PlayStation Support told them "<em>Usually, we are not allowed to process refunds for games that were downloaded because of the PlayStation Store cancellation policy. However, we understand that you are having issues with the game after the troubleshooting that you did and that you want to request a refund for it, so we'll do an exception and process your refund as a goodwill gesture on your account.</em>"</p>
<p>There's been no direct word yet from developer Build A Rocket Boy on the issues that players have been posting about beyond <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1932820162438218030">a statement that it is working on patches</a>, or the refunds, but it's clear that the studio is aware of the trouble the game is currently in. At least in one instance, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22">studio even canceled a sponsored stream it had organized,</a> almost as if it was trying to stop people from playing it publicly.</p>
<p>More accounts of refunds are appearing online, but for now, MindsEye hasn't yet gone full Cyberpunk 2077. PlayStation would have to issue a larger statement and delist it from the store for it to reach the depths that CD Projekt RED hit when Cyberpunk 2077 launched in 2020. But at least in that case, there was a good game to be played under all those bugs. If <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">early reviews and previews</a> are anything to go off, then MindsEye is looking like<a href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"> 2025's Gollum.</a></p>
