			<p>As Helldivers 2 launches onto Xbox Series X/S today, developer Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">debuted a deep-dive</a> into the upcoming Into the Unjust update, which will arrive on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S this coming September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>This new update doesn't just add new worlds for players to liberate, it adds a new flavor to the Helldivers 2 experience, sending players deep into the caves of these Hive Worlds where the Terminid enemy originates, where you'll be without the help of your Super Destroyer. You'll need to work together, even just to see the path ahead of you, as you'll need to coordinate between using your heavy-duty weapons and flashlights to see what's charging at you.</p>



<p>You'll have two new main missions to complete on these Hive Worlds. One is above ground and has you defending an oil rig that is mining oil on these Terminid planets for Super Earth to use on its mission to liberate the universe. The other is what has you going underground, as you try to move through the maze of caves to find the Hive Lung and destroy it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with new planets to explore, you'll face new challenges, with new mole-type enemies that burrow into the ground to try and catch you off guard when they pop up below you, and new dragon bugs. No, really, dragon bugs, called Dragonroach, that spews acidic bile from above you.</p>



<p>Arrowhead even teases a larger subterranean bug that they don't exactly show, but a short clip at the end of the deep dive makes them look like giant worms. We'll be sure to get a closer look at them next week.</p>



<p>With new enemies and challenges also comes new weapons and warbonds, namely the Dust Devils Warbond. There's also the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">Halo ODST crossover</a> that is technically the first time Halo content is available on a PlayStation device. The Halo ODST Warbond is available today, while the Dust Devils Warbond will arrive with the Into the Unjust update next week.</p>

<p>Into the Unjust is the most significant update to Helldivers 2 since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-out-now-fight-on-the-streets-of-super-earth/">Heart of Democracy</a> update earlier this year, and alongside the Halo ODST collaboration, a fitting way to ring in Xbox Series X/S players who are joining the fight for the first time.</p>
