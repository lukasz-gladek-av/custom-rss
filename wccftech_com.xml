			<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade is among the largest we have seen so far, according to a new in-depth analysis of the soon-to-be-released new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the one thing that elevates the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience on the PS5 Pro over the base model is how Performance Mode leverages the power of the system to deliver 60 FPS gameplay, though with some drops in certain scenarios, with the ray-traced global illumination available only in Quality Mode on the base system. As seen in the footage below, RTGI makes quite a bit of a difference, even when, on both base and Pro systems, the game features similar image quality, internal resolution, which is only marginally higher on PlayStation 5 Pro, and graphics settings. Other than sporting RTGI in Performance Mode, Assassin's Creed Shadows on PlayStation 5 Pro features substantial improvements from added specular detail from additional ray tracing. Interestingly enough, the Playstation 5 Pro version also doesn't seem to be using the PSSR upscaler, as it exhibits visual artifacts more in line with analytical upscaling than machine-learning-based upscaling.</p>

<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't push the boundaries of the series' open-world RPG formula first seen in Origins, it delivers solid enhanced by some of the best visuals seen in open-world games that is worth experiencing for all fans of the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Today, Polish developer Far From Home has unveiled the launch date for Forever Skies. The action survival game has been in early access on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-early-access-has-been-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since June 2023</a>, garnering decent but not huge interest from the community. According to estimates based on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1641960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB data</a>, there might be between 164K and 277K owners of the game.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is now set to debut on Monday, April 14, on PC and PlayStation 5. Pre-orders for Sony's console are now live <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10004499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a>, including a Deluxe Edition that gives PlayStation players the chance to purchase the game, gain a collection of cosmetic airship decoration items, and start playing the game three days early (from April 11).</p>
<p>Far From Home has mentioned the following features as the biggest improvements players will find in version 1.0 of Forever Skies:</p>
<p><em>● Biomes: evolving the game’s procedural world with more cohesive environments</em><br>
<em>● Advanced Airship Building: players will find new designs, upgrades, and cosmetics to</em><br>
<em>customize their airship</em><br>
<em>● New Locations: adding to the adventure with new location types and places to explore</em><br>
<em>● … and the final story chapter, where players will be faced with an unprecedented and</em><br>
<em>chilling decision.</em></p>

<p>In Forever Skies, players are scientists returning to Earth long after a global ecological disaster has rendered the planet uninhabitable. They fly in a high-tech airship high above the toxic clouds that are the remnants of humanity's last stand. The airship is the player's home, workshop, and laboratory. After collecting resources, they must manage the airship hull and integrity and improve it.</p>
<p>Of course, exploration and discovery of the remains of humanity's civilization are a big part of the game. Players will find out what happened and why the Earth evolved into a place where humans lost control of their former position at the top. After descending beneath the dust, they discover a strange new world. The surface of the planet has changed in the absence of humanity and is now inhabited by evolved fauna and flora. As scientists, players must hunt viral pathogens to cure a mysterious disease. The game is playable solo or with up to four players in the co-op mode that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added in December 2024</a>.</p>
