			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted the second of <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">its flurry of showcases</a> to kick off 2026 with an <strong>Overwatch Spotlight</strong>, digging into the future of the game and everything players can expect for the coming year. Outside of the official name change back to just 'Overwatch,' we got a look at everything coming in <strong>Season 1: Reign of Talon</strong>, which has officially gone live.</p>



<p>The showcase clearly reinvigorated the Overwatch community, because not only did the game have its "<em>biggest weekend by player count in over a year</em>," according to a press release after the showcase, but the launch of the new season has driven it to reach a new peak concurrent player count on Steam. At the time of this writing, Overwatch has reached <strong>107,004 concurrent players on Steam,</strong> stomping the previous peak of 75,608 players that came when Overwatch (then Overwatch 2) arrived on Steam in 2023.</p>

<p>Across 2026, Blizzard will add a total of 10 new heroes to the game, with <strong>five</strong> of those heroes all arriving in Season 1. The five new heroes are <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage),</strong> and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support).</strong></p>



<p>The classes for each hero will, of course, be recognizable for veteran players, but it's worth remembering that today's update and the arrival of Season 1 also introduce several mechanical changes, like the introduction of sub-classes that all heroes are categorized into on top of their Support, Damage, and Tank classes. If you want a refresher on more of the mechanical changes and the UI/UX changes coming in today's update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">check out our breakdown</a> of everything that came out of the Overwatch Spotlight.</p>



<p>There's also the introduction of a new narrative structure, which sees the story of each hero unfold through cinematics, animated comics, in-game events, and map updates. The first cinematic shows Vendetta defeating Doomfist, which you can check out below if you missed it during the Spotlight.</p>
