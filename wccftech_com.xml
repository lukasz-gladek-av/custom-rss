			<p>The Outer Worlds 2, the second entry in the series developed by Obsidian Entertainment launching this year on PC and consoles, won't be Microsoft's first $80 game, as the game's price has been reduced ahead of its release in a few months.</p>



<p>In a new message shared today, developer Obisidian Entertainment confirmed that the game's price has been revised to $69.99 instead of $79.99. Considering the series is a relatively recent one without a massive following, pricing The Outer Worlds 2 at $80 was a really weird decision that might have impacted the game's sales significantly.</p>







<p>The last we saw of The Outer Worlds 2 was last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with a trailer providing an overview of the story which also confirmed the game's release date, and a more in-depth Direct presentation that provided some additional information on the game's mechanics. Judging from the footage seen so far, the new entry in the series is setting out to expand its predecessor's mechanics considerably, which should result in a game more enjoyable than its predecessor, which left something to be desired in the moment-to-moment gameplay, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">review.</a></p>



<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the fastest-selling piece of video game hardware in the US in the video game industry's history. With 1.6 million units sold in the US according to Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella, it decisively crushed the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4, which sold 1.1 million units in its debut.</p>







<p>Since the Nintendo Switch 2 launched last month, we've seen multiple reports about how it is selling like hotcakes around the world, including in the United States. Just four days from launch, the Switch 2 had reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units sold around the world</a>. It was selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast as the original Nintendo Switch</a> in when it launched in 2017, and it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">breaking records for US sales in its first week</a>. </p>



<p>With Piscatella's report for June 2025, he confirms the Switch 2 is solidly in first place, and also shows how impactful the console's launch was on the video game industry for the month, with hardware spending going up <strong>249%</strong> compared to June 2024. It should also not come as a surprise that the Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling bit of video game hardware in the US for the month in terms of units and in dollars, beating the PlayStation 5 for the month. That said, the PS5 is still the best-selling piece of hardware for 2025 in both categories, though it'll be interesting to see if that changes before the year is out.</p>



<p>Another significant part of the Switch 2's blockbuster launch is that 82% of people who bought a Nintendo Switch 2 in the US in June also bought <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, either through the Switch 2 bundle or as a physical game separate from the console. The second-best-selling game for Nintendo platforms last month was Cyberpunk 2077, followed by Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma in third, then The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rounding out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively. </p>







<p>Leaving Switch 2 territory for a bit, other notable aspects of the June 2025 sales charts for the US video game industry are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> continuing to sell strongly, making its way into the top-10 best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far at the number eight spot, and being the top-selling premium game in the US for June 2025. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> found itself behind Nightreign in the number two spot on the sales charts for June 2025, and has yet to crack the top-20 best-selling games of the year so far in the US. Zooming in to platform-specific sales charts however shows Death Stranding 2 on the top of the charts for PlayStation 5 game sales in the US.</p>



<p>Lastly, Stellar Blade is the other notable entry on the sales charts, jumping up to second place on the PC sales charts and from 185th place to fifth place on the overall sales charts for June 2025, thanks to its launch on PC. Like everything else though, it still found itself looking up at Nightreign in first place.</p>



<p>All that said, the Nintendo Switch 2 dominating the charts is probably the most unsurprising event in 2025. What's exciting about watching the console now is seeing just how far it goes. We're not yet certain as to how many units were sold globally in June, though reports from earlier in the month put it at surpassing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/">5 million</a>. Marketing analysis firm <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">DFC Intelligence has the Switch 2 selling 16 million units</a> before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At this rate, it feels like the Switch 2 will almost certainly reach those heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Greedfall developer Spiders has laid off most of the animation team, according to Lead Animator Erwan Perrin, who wrote the following message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hey! We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the Industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected …If you're looking for some talented and passionated Paris based Animator or a Rig Artist, hit me up.</em></p>



<p>It is unfortunately only the latest instance of a seemingly unending wave of layoffs, from the largest companies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA laying off between 300 and 400 employees including at Respawn and Codemasters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft shutting down The Initiative</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceling the new MMO in development at ZeniMax Online Studios</a>) to mid-sized ones like <a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">Supermassive</a> and now Spiders, too.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World hasn't done well since <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its launch in early access</a>, that's for sure. The game 'peaked' at 375 concurrent players on Steam, but it is barely being played at this point, with yesterday's daily peak registered at a mere 10 players. User reviews are also very negative—the total sits at 55%, but the recent reviews are even lower rated (40%).</p>



<p>One of the main sticking points for most of the community and, indeed, the undersigned, is the combat system, which was changed from the real-time action of the first Greedfall to a tab-targeting-like combat reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins or MMOs like World of Warcraft. Spiders has since taken steps to improve the feel of the combat through better animations and sounds, but the core remained the same, and it definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt very dated</a>. It's a shame, as the first Greedfall <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a fun and well-made action RPG</a> that warranted a proper sequel.</p>
