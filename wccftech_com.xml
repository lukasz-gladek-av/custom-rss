			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong> developer <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> will reveal the next <strong>Life is Strange</strong> game next week on <strong>January 20, 2026,</strong> in a live stream that will kick off at <strong>10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</strong></p>



<p>The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists <strong>Max Caulfield </strong>and <strong>Chloe Price</strong>, who walk across the frame in the teaser.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched</a> - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning.</p>



<p>This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans. In the meantime, if you're looking for more Life is Strange, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/">Amazon has greenlit a TV series adaptation of the franchise led by Kaos writer <strong>Charlie Covell</strong></a>. </p>

			<p>After revealing who will be stepping into the role of <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Kratos</strong> in <strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> adaptation yesterday</a>, the company is back with another reveal today for one of its other video game adaptation TV series. This time, it's not a casting reveal, but more of a costume reveal, as we have our first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong> as one of video games' most iconic characters, <strong>Lara Croft</strong>, for the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> series.</p>



<p>"<em>Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way</em>," reads the caption of the post on the official <a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011800568835051933">Prime Video X (formerly Twitter)</a> account that first showed off Turner's new look. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Turner was confirmed to be the latest actress stepping into the role <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">back in September 2025</a>, at which point Amazon also confirmed that filming for the series would begin sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. Just last week, several more casting choices were announced, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-show-adds-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-to-the-cast/">including <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> as Lara's uncle, and <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong></a> as a mysterious new character who is looking to put Lara's unique set of skills to use.</p>



<p>The rest of the cast is rounded out by <strong>Martin Bobb-Semple, Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson, Paterson Joseph, Sasha Luss, Juliette Motamed, Celia Imrie </strong>and<strong> August Wittgenstein</strong>, all of whom  (save for Peterson, Isaacs, and Bobb-Semple) are playing brand new characters in the series.</p>



<p>This is the same adaptation that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">first announced back in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, with the award-winning <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong> signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series. Hopefully, as filming starts later this year, we'll begin to learn more about the story and the approach the adaptation is taking with the show.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, Star Wars Outlaws, Guild Wars: Reforged and More Join GeForce NOW]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-quarantine-the-last-check-star-wars-outlaws-guild-wars-reforged/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After announcing several of the titles that'll be joining <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> throughout the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/">month of <strong>January 2026</strong> right at the start of the new year</a>, we have <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-quarantine-zone/">a new batch of games revealed today</a> for yet another GeForce NOW Thursday that will be joining the service. Some, like <strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</strong>, which leads the group this week, have previously been announced. Others, like <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</strong>, are new reveals joining NVIDIA's cloud streaming service.</p>



<p>This week's new batch of games sees a total of <strong>nine titles</strong> entering the GeForce NOW library, including the aforementioned three titles, the first two games in the <strong>Styx</strong> franchise, both of which will be free on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> starting today, <strong>Guild Wars: Reforged</strong>, and <strong>Tavern Keeper</strong>.</p>



<p>The headliner for this week, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, is the latest game published by renowned indie publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, the team known for publishing the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-december-2025-games/">Skate Story</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</a></strong> and <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong>, to name a few. It sees you stepping into the shoes of a checkpoint officer, scanning people into the Quarantine Zone, acting as the last line of defense for the people in the zone. If you mistakenly let someone sick into the zone, you could set the plague loose on an already crumbling society.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check<em> </em>(New release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, Jan. 12, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>

<p>As we noted at the start of the year, we still have no word on some of January's bigger releases, like <strong>Code Vein II</strong>, joining the service. There's still time, though, before its release at the end of the month, so hopefully, we'll see it added either later in the month or at least sometime soon this year.</p>

For even more on the game, Kai and Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to speak with the game's producer, <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong> and director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/">and you can read that interview here</a>. </p>
