			<p>Xbox has been struggling recently when it comes to finances, as its consoles aren't selling as well as the company had hoped. As a result, they have started pushing their software and subscription services more. Despite that, they made several changes to the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass, which led to a lot of outrage from people in the gaming community as the prices increased. The price wasn't just adjusted in one country, but the price for Game Pass Ultimate, Core, and PC Game Pass were all increased, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">the cost of Game Pass Ultimate increasing</a> from $16 to $19.99 for a monthly subscription. Despite their price increases, their finances still weren't looking great. It's been confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/bdsams/status/1851715686017699940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft FY25 Q1 (July-September) report</a> that Activision has been heavily pulling the weight for them.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition of Activision, Xbox's gaming revenue has grown by 43%, with all of the gaming revenue coming specifically from Activision. Additionally, Xbox content and services revenue grew by 61%, with 53 points of net impact being from the Activision acquisition. While it wasn't specified in the report, it's assumed that the growth comes from Game Pass. This would be expected, as some of Activision's games are making an appearance on the subscription service for the first time. This is the first time that people who use the subscription service will be able to play a Call of Duty game via Game Pass, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was added to the service as a day-one release. Additionally, users will have access to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone.</p>
<p>Also mentioned in the report is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/">Xbox hardware</a> revenue has declined 29% year-on-year, which was expected. Microsoft hasn't worked on releasing any new console compared to their competitors, who have openly expressed that they are working on new consoles, with Sony even releasing the PlayStation 5 Pro. Whether Xbox plans on making another console seems to be up in the air at the moment, but it has been hinted at in the past that the next console to come will be "<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">making a huge technological leap</a>," as reported by Sarah Bond. It's also been teased that they are looking into making a handheld console, but again, nothing has been confirmed by the company.</p>
<p>Overall, Xbox's finances seem to be balancing back out a little bit, but it's obvious that without Activision they would be in deep water, as Activision is carrying their finances significantly with major releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

			<p>World of Warcraft: The War Within has been out for a little while now, and the next major update will be coming soon. The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24152008/the-war-within-1107-content-update-on-the-ptr-october-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11.0.7 update</a> will be available on the PTR as of October 31, where players will be able to get their first glimpse at the new zone named Siren Isle. With the addition of Siren Isle comes a new currency called Flame Blessed Iron, which can be used to obtain new mounts, pets, gear, and transmogs. It will even allow players to get their hands on upgrades for a ring that they stumble across called Cyrce's Circlet. That's not all, as Flame Blessed Iron is also used to spawn in an event boss, which has the opportunity for more rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Siren Isle Preview | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give players a sneak peek into what they can expect from the upcoming zone, a new video has been released to showcase Siren Isle and explain the region in a bit more depth so players know what they can expect from the next major update for World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>In addition to the new zone coming to 11.0.7, players will get to participate in the Plunderstorm event once more. If you've ever wanted to be a swashbuckling pirate on the hunt for treasure, now is the perfect time. Keg Leg makes a return to Arathi Highlands, and you have to join the crew and fight to be the last pirate standing while making sure to grab as much loot as you can to get new and returning transmogs and mounts.</p>
<p>With this update comes more story, with players able to dive into the aftermath of the Dalaran explosion in the epilogue questline. This questline sees the Kirin Tor investigate their past mistakes and choose the path for their future. Additionally, there will be more story chapters for players to complete, where players will meet face-to-face with someone familiar in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Turbulent Timeways event will also be returning, where players will be given a chance to complete time walking dungeons from the previous expansions each week, which will provide the player with Heroic rewards and help them improve their item level, as well as get some gear to sell. Those who participate and manage to master the Timeways will be given the Timely Buzzbee Skyriding mount.</p>
<p>Finally, Humans and Kul Tiran will be given new Arathi ear customizations, which can be accessed by going to a Barber Shop, where you will be able to tweak your ear design to choose the new Arathi customizations.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">Warcraft 30th Anniversary</a> is 13 days away, where there will be even more announcements regarding World of Warcraft, as well as other games like Warcraft Rumble and Hearthstone.</p>
