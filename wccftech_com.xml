			<p><strong>Blizzard's</strong> latest update for <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, patch <strong>2.5.2</strong>, is set to go live today at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BT, adding the Tower in the seasonal realm and Leaderboards in a Beta state, with Blizzard introducing them early to give more time for player feedback.</p>



<p>For now, the Beta introduction of the Tower and Leaderboards may be a bit buggy, Blizzard warns, but encourages players to leave their feedback as the team will continue to build out more features for the Tower and Leaderboards in Diablo IV in future updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Tear through the Tower, a fearsome new experience for many players, with a chance to earn a place on the Leaderboards," </em>Blizzard writes in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta">a blog post on today's update</a><em>. "Arriving in Beta with 2.5.2, the Tower and Leaderboards are launching early so we can shape the experience together with your feedback."</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>In the Tower, you’ll battle your way through a series of floors featuring randomized layouts and monster families. Push deeper, race against the clock and unleash your build as you fight toward the final Tower boss to complete your run.</em>"</p>



<p>Only players who have completed Rank 2 of the season rank will be able to access the Tower, so you'll have to get that finished before trying to place your name at the top of the leaderboards, which will be updated in two-week rounds throughout each season. The day before this current season, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-divine-intervetion-lands-on-december-11/">Season of Divine Intervention</a></strong> ends, the leaderboards will close and be locked in, cementing your place in the rankings.</p>



<p>Leaderboards, a new ranking system, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/"><strong>Lord of Hatred</strong></a> expansion were three of the teases included in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">2026 section of the last roadmap Blizzard put out for Diablo IV</a>. Now that we're a dozen days into 2026, and we know that the Lord of Hatred expansion will arrive this coming <strong>April 28, 2026,</strong> we'll hopefully get a clearer idea of what Blizzard has planned for Diablo IV this year soon.</p>



<p>The Lord of Hatred expansion was revealed at<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"> The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, and is the second major expansion coming to Diablo IV after its first expansion, <strong>Vessel of Hatred</strong>, arrived in October 2024. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo reviewed Vessel of Hatred at its launch</a>, he called it "<em>a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Lord of Hatred is able to improve on Diablo IV in more ways than just systemically, building off the foundation left by Vessel of Hatred.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While there hasn't been a new main entry in the series in a long time - not counting the 2018's MMO - the Fallout series is more popular than ever thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Amazon Prime TV Show</strong></a>. The adaptation effectively rejuvenated the franchise, attracting millions of new players to its post-apocalyptic world and prompting them to explore older titles, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong>.</p>



<p>The series' resurgence has also breathed new life into an old debate among the community: the "purist" first two entries versus the first-person RPGs developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bethesda Game Studios</strong>. According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Chris Avellone</strong>, the lead developer of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> - which many feel is the true successor to the original top-down games - the series' current direction has a simple reason: Bethesda doesn't fully understand its roots. Nor does it care.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009457239694954576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009457239694954576%7Ctwgr%5Ebe45c50dada723054da89576b40cc48a3f92b2b1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Ffallout%2Fi-dont-think-bethesda-hates-fallout-says-new-vegas-lead-they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care%2F"><strong>Replying to a fan's question regarding whether Bethesda "hates" the original series on X</strong></a>, Avellone was remarkably clear: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"I don’t think Bethesda hates Fallout, they just don’t fully understand its roots and arguably, don’t care - they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm."</em></p>



<p>This lack of deeper connection is what Avellone believes fuels the series' current design philosophy. <em>"This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout – and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me,"</em> Avellone pointed out.</p>



<p>Although these statements sound harsh, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</strong> </em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong> veteran clarified that he doesn't hate Bethesda, highlighting some of their strengths. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"There are things they do well (open world exploration), and there are things they do badly (telling linear stories in open world games and their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill). But every developer has their pros and cons,"</em> Avellone concluded.</p>



<p>As someone who loves the first two entries and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout </strong></em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong>, but could never really get into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4</em></strong>, I can only agree with Avellone's sentiment. While the Bethesda entries are undeniably solid open-world RPGs, they often feel like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</em> games only on the surface, missing those small elements that made the original games and the Obsidian title truly memorable.</p>



<p>Standing as one of the best modern entries in the series, a remastered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> would be an extremely welcome release to tide fans over until the release of the inevitable fifth entry, which may not see the light of day for a long time, with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>Bethesda still hard at work on </strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong></a>. Hopefully, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">recent rumors suggesting the game is </strong></a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returning soon</strong></a>&nbsp;will prove to be correct, allowing us to finally revisit</span> the Mojave Wasteland and experience it like never before.</p>

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> signed a 10-year deal with <strong>Nintendo</strong></a> that promised to bring <strong>Call of Duty</strong> to Team Red's console in order to help get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard across the finish line, technically speaking, seeing the shooter franchise arrive on the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> (or more likely, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) has been a sure thing.</p>



<p>We're four years into that deal, and still no Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, but a recent datamine spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-on-nintendo-switch-datamine">Eurogamer</a> seems to indicate that the shooter's arrival on the platform is "<em>imminent</em>."</p>



<p>Dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/2010381277011284375">Realityuk</a>, who has previously shared accurate datamined files related to Call of Duty updates, spotted a mention of Nintendo in the launcher code the last time they delved into Call of Duty HQ, and believes it is an indication that we'll see the official announcement the next time Nintendo hosts a major event. </p>



<p>This datamine comes just three weeks after a report pointing to Call of Duty arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/">sometime in 2026, potentially launching "<em>in a few months</em>."</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, was first talking about the deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's console,<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/"> he admitted that it</a> "<em></em><em>would likely take a little bit of time</em>" to make the port happen. </p>



<p>Now that it has been "<em>a little bit of time</em>" since that deal was inked, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is not just a poorly-kept secret but the latest console on the market, it seems like we are coming very close to seeing the world's most popular shooter franchise arrive on the hybrid console.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least it's not a question of 'if' but just a question of 'when.' Hopefully, we'll hear more official news soon.</p>
