			<p>Studio Atelico is a brand new gaming startup that has been founded by veterans of Uber, Meta, and Creative Assembly. Today they announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/">new AI Engine</a> that will enable game developers to create game experiences that are powered by GenAI that run on-device without having to pay extortionate prices for cloud solutions. With Atelico AI Engine, the costs of production are significantly reduced for developers, and it provides them with an experience that gives them full control and power.</p>
<p>CEO, Piero Molino made a statement today regarding their new AI engine, saying: "The revolution is upon us. GenAI is enabling new interactive experiences that have never been possible before. However, the current, large-model approach that Cloud AI providers are taking is fundamentally flawed for video games. Game developers currently implementing GenAI in their games are struggling due to the high costs and the lack of fine-grained control needed in video game development."</p>

<p>Of course, Generative AI in gaming is a heavy point of contention for both the consumer and the creator. There are people who feel that it should be left safely in the hands of humans to develop, while others feel that there are creative minds out there who should be able to use tools to make the development process easier without having to put the effort in.</p>
<p>Already there are many games on the market using AI, with a fair few of them not disclosing the fact that they are using AI in their titles. An<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ex-Steam Labs developer</a> has claimed that there are over 1000 Steam games that are using generative AI. This includes titles such as The Finals, Tribes 3, and Atman: Rebel Flame.</p>
<p>While most known studios won't be using AI for their games, more and more studios and developers are coming out of the woodwork with AI games. With the release of the Atelico AI Engine, there will now be even more potential for AI titles.</p>
<p>The Atelico AI Engine can be embedded into game engines, where the user will have full control and flexibility with the modular design of the tool. To showcase the tool, Studio Atelico has released a tech demo which is inspired by the Stanford paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." You can see the tech demo above, where you can see the model in action.</p>
<p>"Atelico AI Engine is the perfect tool for developers to invent entirely new game genres. We foresee a Cambrian explosion of creativity, where our AI tools empower designers to build more immersive experiences and truly widen the horizon of what's possible. The only limitation is the developer's imagination," says <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/cloud-ai-for-video-games-is-dead-on-arrival?dm_i=2AEH,21IEL,AMZC5B,7EFIS,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ennio De Nucci, Co-Founder and Design</a> Director of Studio Atelico.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new posts</a> from Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella, he predicts that Nintendo's next hardware device (which is supposed to be the Nintendo Switch 2) will sell approximately 4.3 million units in the US in 2025, assuming that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released in the first half of the year. Many were expecting more news to be released last year, but it felt that the audience was still kept in suspense, as we are no closer to knowing the release date of the upcoming console.&nbsp; Despite that, there are tons of leaks coming out about the upcoming console constantly, with some being believable and others being incredibly outlandish.</p>
<p>At the moment, the console doesn't have a set release date, but according to an Italian website, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/">the Nintendo Switch 2 could launch on March 28</a>. However, all of these rumors come after people <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">speculated that it would be announced before the New Year</a>, except that information never came. Whether it will be released in the first half of the year remains to be seen. However, if it does, it means that revenue will be on the rise for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Despite that, Nintendo isn't expected to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold, according to Mat Piscatella. Instead, he believes that the PlayStation 5 will continue to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold in the US during the year. This statistic could very well be possible, especially with the release of the PS5 Pro, with new games getting PS5 Pro enhancements regularly.</p>
<p>If the Switch 2 is released in the first half of the year, Piscatella says that he expects to see hardware constraints for several months after due to a significant early demand surge. This is something that has been seen for all recent console releases, with the PlayStation 5 in particular continuing to suffer from this. With there being hardware constraints have led to prices being raised and the console constantly being out of stock, especially with the consoles ending up in the hands of scalpers, where tons of consoles then resurface on online markets for an extortionate price.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Piscatella gave a sneak peek into the percentage growth in video game spending for the year, saying that he expects low to mid-single-digit percentage growth over the year, helped by Nintendo Next and Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite GTA VI reportedly being released this year, there are many who are now beginning to lose faith in that and feel that it will be delayed until later in the year or even next year.</p>
