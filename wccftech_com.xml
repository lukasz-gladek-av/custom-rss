			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> has revealed the <strong>four games</strong> that will be offered to <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> and higher-tier subscribers for the month of February 2026. The games will be made available on <strong>February 3, 2026,</strong> with the boxing game <strong>Undisputed</strong> and survival game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> headlining the monthly offerings after PlayStation kicked off the year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/"><strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong></a>. </p>



<p>The official announcement was shared <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, as it usually is, and also, as usual, at least one of the coming games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911">had already leaked on Dealabs</a>, with Undisputed being the game to leak early this time. </p>



<p>Beyond Undisputed and Subnautica: Below Zero, the monthly offerings for February include two other standout titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/"><strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>,</a> which is arriving just in time for anyone who hasn't yet played it to prepare themselves for the arrival of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a></strong>, and <strong>Ultros</strong>, the indie metroidvania from developer <strong>Hadoque</strong>, which sees players explore a twisting Sarcophagus.</p>

<p>With the above four titles set to arrive on February 3, that means you have until <strong>February 2, 2026,</strong> to add January's monthly PS Plus Essential games to your library, if you haven't already. If you're a PS Plus Extra or even Premium tier subscriber, then this is unfortunately another month where you're getting games that were already available to you in the Games Catalog, as Ultros entered the PS Plus Extra catalog when it launched back in February 2024.</p>



<p>At least PlayStation players at every tier of a PS Plus subscription and even those not subscribed to the service can <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reportedly look forward to a new <strong>State of Play</strong> event, currently said to be happening sometime during the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, if it's not on the 12th itself.</p>

			<p>On top of <strong>Ubisoft</strong> being under fire from all sides after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">recent "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>" announcement</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/">its <strong>workers planning to strike</strong></a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">share price dropping to historic lows</a>, and upsetting its fans by cancelling projects like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, the studio's social media team has seemingly gone out of its way to cause more confusion and unrest in players with a bit of an odd response to a new leak regarding the heavily-rumored <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There have been several leaks regarding the Black Flag remake, the most recent of which (prior to today's leak) revealed the remake's supposed title: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a><em>.</em></strong> That was a result of a PEGI rating, which, compared to the new leak, is arguably a bigger deal than what we have now.</p>



<p>Today's leak came in the form of a new statue figurine for <strong>Edward Kenway</strong>, the protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV. The statue was shared online by <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2016172983551984100">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> after being spotted on resale platform <strong>Vinted</strong>, where a seller identified it as a new figure that would be out later this year.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this leak doesn't do much beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">adding to the pile of leaks</a> we've already seen, which have really only proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">that we can expect the remake to arrive eventually</a>. The current buzz is that the statue is that it's actually what'll be included in the Collector's Edition of the remake. However, for some reason, the leaked statue has prompted a direct response from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">official Assassin's Creed account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft's social media team employed the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas "<em>Ah s***, here we go again</em>" meme as its way of responding to the leak. Now, this can of course be taken positively, as if it's Ubisoft providing a soft confirmation that the remake is happening and that we're about to "<em>go again</em>" with Edward Kenway's journey.</p>



<p>But instead of Assassin's Creed fans replying with excitement to a soft unofficial confirmation, the reply has brought more ire towards Ubisoft, with multiple replies from users immediately taking the negative approach, with one saying, "<em>What? You gonna cancel it like you canceled Sands of Time?</em>"</p>



<p>As to the actual status of the remake, since the project has never been directly confirmed, we can't actually say where it stands. Following the announcement of Ubisoft's restructuring, it was reported that the Black Flag remake was one of the seven projects to get delayed, but that it was not one of the unannounced projects to get cancelled. The only cancelled project we knew about was the Sands of Time Remake, while the others were unannounced. None of the games that got delayed have been officially identified by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>If Ubisoft was even on the verge of thinking about cancelling the Black Flag Remake, then it's likely this reply never gets posted. This is much more likely a soft tease, potentially indicating that we'll get a reveal for the remake sometime soon, even if it has been delayed.</p>



<p>Still, it feels like if there was ever a time to pull back on memes and soft teases, this would be it for Ubisoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/"> as it is currently under heavy amounts of scrutiny over its restructuring</a>.</p>
