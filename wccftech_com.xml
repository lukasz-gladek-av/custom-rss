			<p>In the span of a few hours, two promising projects from former Mass Effect developers were abruptly halted. Both were sci-fi titles that fans hoped could be reminiscent of BioWare's acclaimed RPG saga.</p>
<p>The first one, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two days ago, was Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin studio, which had to be shut down due to a sudden lack of funding. A few hours ago, Mac Walters announced similar news (though not as dire) for his Worlds Untold studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Mac Walters, a writer on Mass Effect 3 and game director on Andromeda and the Legendary Edition compilation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Worlds Untold last year with funding from NetEase. That's the problem: they have split with NetEase and are now seeking another partner. In the meantime, work on the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life. This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together. </em><em>In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I’m deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we’ve had together at Worlds Untold. While we’re pausing for now, this isn’t goodbye—there’s more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>We interviewed former Mass Effect writer and director Mac Walters last year as part of the news announcement, and we learned that the project would be more of an action/adventure title rather than an RPG, more story-driven and linear.</p>
<p><em>I've done RPGs and I love them, but I wanted to do something that led with story. It's an action RPG but with a lot of story and as much as we were always able to blend that into the RPG choose-your-own-adventure style, I really like the idea of telling something that's perhaps a little bit more linear. It looks at choice and consequence and things like that but in a different light.</em></p>
<p><em>I was also looking at some of the games that I had enjoyed recently, whether it was The Last of Us, Uncharted, or Tomb Raider that I get kind of get swept away in. I really wanted to focus on building a game that allowed me to tell a great adventure story.</em></p>
<p>We wish Walters and all the Worlds Untold team members involved the very best.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during their financial report for Q3 2024, CD Projekt RED announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now surpassed 30 million units sold, while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, has sold 8 million in around a year.</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CDPR, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In less than four years since release, we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year, it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year, the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips.</em></p>
<p>Despite the controversial launch that featured many bugs and issues, especially on consoles, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of all time, following up on what was arguably the best game of the previous generation - The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. As such, even with all those caveats, it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest digital launch ever</a>, with an estimated 10.2 million units by January 2021. Sales probably slowed down for a while after that due to word of mouth and the fact that Sony outright removed the game from its PlayStation Store for several months.</p>
<p>However, CD Projekt RED's constant updates completely turned around the reception, culminating in the release of Update 2.0 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. All this work paid off, allowing what was already a rough diamond to properly shine. The sales are only the obvious consequence.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Cyberpunk 2077 that performed well for the Polish studio, as The Witcher 3 continues to sell even nine years after its launch. Overall, total revenue amounted to $55.7 million, while the company registered a consolidated net profit of $19 million.</p>
<p>The other big news of the day was, as already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the announcement that The Witcher 4 (codenamed Project Polaris) is officially in full-scale production. On this, Nowakowski said:</p>
<p><em>I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its own North American-based team</a>, so work on that game continues separately. However, it's clear that most of CDPR's attention will be on the upcoming The Witcher game for the next few years.</p>

			<p>Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-gamescom-first-look-and-qa-a-crpg-about-magic-vs-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style of game</a> that New Arc Line was shaping up to be, it had some pretty big boots to fill. I wasn't sure what to expect with my time with New Arc Line, but I found that for the vast majority of my playthrough of the cRPG that is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available in early access</a>, I was pleasantly surprised. The game has a lot of potential but still needs just a little bit more fine-tuning to really make it shine.</p>
<p>Diving into the game, you are greeted with character creation, as with any proper roleplaying game. While it doesn't quite live up to the extensive customization options featured in Baldur's Gate 3, there is enough variety to still make your character yours. What I found disappointing was the chance to choose between only two classes. Whether this was just for this early access or a permanent feature, I'm unsure at the moment. Regardless, instead of choosing the tech themed class, I went for the Voodoo class. Anything with magic or necromancy is always up my alley, and I won't pass up an opportunity to play it. The other main gripe I had with character creation was the inability to zoom in on your character's face, meaning you can't tweak the fine details exactly how you'd like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Getting into the prologue of the game, I was stunned by how beautiful the game was. It felt like a mix between BioShock Infinite and Disco Elysium, and I was all here for it. It reproduced the entirely underrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steampunk fantasy setting</a> through a highly immersive dystopia. However, while I did enjoy the world-building throughout my time with New Arc Line, I would understand if people stopped playing during the prologue. It's a bit of a grind to get through, as your character shuffles about at a snail's pace, and there is a rather wide region to explore, especially if you like getting all the knickknacks as I do.</p>
<p>I was continuously impressed by the finer graphical details. The water was so beautifully animated and had sparkles in all the right places, which helped add to that utopia versus dystopia vibe, especially when you're first entering the New World. I liked that, to find out which of the nearby items was interactable, I could just hold down Alt, and it would highlight them, similar to the system in Baldur's Gate 3. On the flip side, the hitboxes were a little bit off. You had to have your mouse a fair amount of space away from the marker to be able to collect anything or speak with someone. During battles, this made it far too difficult, and this is where I started to lose interest.</p>
<p>The voice-acting felt fitting to New Arc Line, but it was also a tad confusing trying to guess which messages would be voice-acted. Sometimes, I was expecting the paragraph to be narrated, and it simply wasn't, with other insignificant paragraphs being narrated instead. The narration and voice-acting felt very inconsistent, as if they couldn't decide which parts should be narrated and which should be left for the player to read themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it came to battling for the first time, I didn't really enjoy the UI layout. It felt very small and cramped, and it was easy to miss details beneficial to the fight. Additionally, the hitbox issue proved to cause a lot of problems during the battle and led to my companion dying on the docks because of this. I would try to target one of the enemies, and it would very clearly hover over that specific enemy, only for my character to attack the other enemy. This happened multiple times throughout, which is what led to my companion dying, as he was taking unnecessary hits from an enemy that should have already died.</p>
<p>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed, and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. This game has a lot of potential, and you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm excited to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</p>
