			<p>Today, Ubisoft announced that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting an expansion titled From the Ashes, arriving on all platforms on December 19, 2025. The expansion brings players back to Pandora to a section of its western front and places them in a new story that is arriving the same day as the release of the next film in James Cameron's cinematic series, Avatar: Fire and Ash.</p>



<p>You can tell by the trailer that the tone of this expansion is darker than the story of the base game, and according to Ubisoft it'll even take advantage of features soon to be implemented in the game, namely the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/">third-person mode due to arrive on December 5, 2025</a>, two weeks ahead of the expansion's release.</p>



<p>From the Ashes follows So'lek on a revenge mission after the Ash clan teamed up with the RDA, ambushing him and his fellow Sarentu Na'vi. When he wakes up after the attack, his rage takes him on a destructive path to try to save his family and deliver justice to his enemies.</p>



<p>"<em>With From the Ashes, we wanted to push the boundaries of what players can experience on Pandora</em>," said Omar Bouali, Massive Entertainment's creative director, in a press release. "<em>This expansion delivers a darker, more personal story, enhanced immersion via both the first and third-person gameplay</em>, <em>and intense new combat mechanics that deepen the emotional and tactical stakes. We wanted to offer fans a thrilling new perspective on the Western Frontier, with deeper storytelling and more visceral gameplay</em>."</p>

<p>Executive vice president of franchise development at Lightstorm Entertainment (the production company founded by James Cameron), Josua Izzo, added, "<em>Our partnership with Massive Entertainment has allowed us to expand this universe in bold new ways with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This new expansion, From the Ashes, will release at the same day as the theatrical release for Avatar: Fire and Ash - a film that explores darker corners of Pandora and introduces the formidable Ash People - we're equally excited for Avatar fans to experience untold stories through new interactive adventures</em>."</p>



<p>So basically, you can head to your local cinema to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash when it premieres, and then jump into the From the Ashes expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on your PC or console when you get home.</p>



<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to experience this new chapter in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,</em>" continued Luigi Priore, vice president and general manager of Disney and Pixar Games. "<em>From the Ashes continues the journey of Na'vi resistance warrior So'lek and demonstrates how Disney and Pixar Games works with our collaborators to craft wholly original stories grounded in the worlds they love</em>."</p>



<p>The expansion will be available for $24.99 USD, though if you don't already own Frontiers of Pandora, you'll be able to grab the expansion and the base game in a bundled 'From the Ashes' edition for $39.99.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1m-on-steam-not-counting-dl2-users.1305585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/dying-light-the-beast-hades-and-so?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#media-82268893-9e3f-41e4-9121-2afef3744476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Alinea Analytics newsletter</a>, Dying Light: The Beast has sold over a million units on Steam and over a million and a half overall. </p>



<p>You might recall that Polish developer Techland had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> of having received a million pre-orders even before launch. However, that figure included Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition users; since Dying Light: The Beast started its life as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, Ultimate Edition users are still entitled to it as originally promised by the studio. Now, though, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics tells me the game has actually sold one million new copies on Valve's platform. The newsletter also says that, as you would expect, 82% of the players played the original Dying Light, and 77% played the sequel. That is to say, especially early on, dedicated fans have returned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast topped Steam's weekly sales, but the other big titles released earlier this month continued to do well. Borderlands 4 added 337K units to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its previous two million units</a>. Hollow Knight: Silksong sold another 255K on top of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">existing five million units</a>, and other indie games like Peak and Shape of Dreams also continued to do very well. </p>



<p>No, I’m Not Human, a freshly released first-person horror visual novel from Trioskaz, sold over 200K copies on its debut week. Jump Space, <a href="https://wccftech.com/jump-space-gamescom-2025-qa-little-bit-hazelight-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sci-fi cooperative space adventure game from Keepsake</a>, also had a great early access launch week, topping even EA Sports FC 26 (at least on Steam).</p>



<p>Another game that did well last week was Hades, which sold over 150K units (crossing the nine million units milestone) thanks to a 75% discount. Supergiant timed it right in advance of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 launch of Hades 2</a>, and Alinea Analytics reckons this will be the next big hit on Steam. The game has already sold over two million copies in early access, so there's a solid chance it will land around two million daily active users when it launches in two days.</p>



<p>As a side note, according to Alinea's estimates, Palworld has surpassed 25 million copies across all platforms. Incidentally, PocketPair has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the spin-off farming game Palworld: Palfarm.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/painkiller-revival-slightly-delayed-new-rougelike-mode-gameplay-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-revival-gets-slightly-delayed-deeper-into-october-new-rougelike-mode-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1305579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-remake-officially-set-for-october-9-launch/">announcing</a> that the Painkiller revival from publisher 3D Realms and developer Anshar Studios would arrive on October 9, the game's arrival has been slightly pushed back a little more than a week into October to now launch on October 21, 2025. Alongside the reveal, we also got another action-packed trailer for the classic FPS game's comeback that makes it seem like it'll be worth the extra wait.</p>



<p>The Rogue Angel trailer features a look at a new roguelike mode that'll be included in the game when it arrives on October 21, adding more for players to do on top of the game's campaign mode, which will be playable solo or for the first time with the arrival of this new title, in a three-player co-op mode. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new mode takes players into a new realm of Purgatory, with procedurally generated arenas, new upgrades to make you and your teammates even stronger, and seemingly endless hordes of demons to shoot.</p>



<p>Initially announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/">March of this year</a>, this Painkiller revival brings the original 2004 shooter from Outriders and Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly back to the forefront, asking players to jump back into the boots of those condemned to Purgatory to try and escape your prison and redeem yourself for your own salvation.</p>



<p>Which is all just a backdrop to go shoot hordes and hordes of demons in some fast-paced FPS fun. Now with a roguelike mode to boot.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month.1305456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years ago, on September 21, 2023, Starbreeze Entertainment released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">Payday 3</a>, a game that might've pushed the series forward in terms of its approach to stealth gameplay and its visuals, but was an abysmal mess with <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-peaked-at-1-3-million-daily-users-starbreeze-apologizes-for-server-issues/">server issues</a>, no offline mode, and a massive lack of content compared to Payday 2. </p>



<p>Two years later, Starbreeze is <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1970046991779434606">celebrating the 14th anniversary of the Payday series</a>, though it's a muted celebration, as it's most recent release is far less popular than the game it made before. Looking at Steam concurrent numbers alone, Payday 2 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/">still has thousands of players</a> going on heists and enjoying the wealth of content available with its many DLCs. Payday 3, on the other hand, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/">struggles to hit 1k players</a> with any kind of consistency.</p>



<p>That's probably why, as part of today's anniversary celebrations, Starbreeze has introduced two noteworthy bits of news for Payday fans. Firstly, Payday 3 is getting an <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/09/new-skill-system-preview/">overhauled skill system</a> as Starbreeze continues to try to shape Payday 3 into a game that Payday fans want to play more than Payday 2.</p>



<p>Second, while everyone who still wants to play a Payday game is playing Payday 2, Starbreeze has introduced a new subscription for (almost) all the 65+ DLCs available for the heist shooter. It's not every DLC that's been released for Payday 2, because it doesn't include any DLC content that's been retired or removed.</p>



<p>It's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847540/PAYDAY_2_Subscription/">$5/month subscription</a> to access the many DLCs available for Payday 2, which Starbreeze says it has introduced because, "<em>Payday 2 has had a lot of DLCs released, and for many players, especially new ones, it can be difficult to know what DLC content you may be interested in. So we’ve introduced the Subscription to give an easy way to access all DLC content at a low monthly price.</em>"</p>



<p>That might seem sensible and like a good deal on face value, even when considering that you will need to buy Payday 2 separately to access any of the content in the subscription. But that's before you realize that Payday 2's DLCs routinely go on sale, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/3756/">Legacy Collection</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/34119/#prices">Infamous Collection</a>, the latter of which includes every DLC ever released for Payday 2, going on sale a few times a year for anywhere between 20% and 30% off.</p>



<p>In fairness to Starbreeze, it's not the only studio trying something like this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/">Cities: Skylines</a> offers a similar service, as do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538960/Crusader_Kings_II__Expansion_Subscription/">Crusader Kings II</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_Classic_2024/">Train Simulator</a>, to name a few. But whether it'll actually help Starbreeze keep the lights on while it tries to fix Payday 3 is another question, and so far it doesn't seem to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nnssb4/wait_what_payday_2_subscription/">gone over too well with the Payday community</a>. </p>



<p>Not everything has to be a subscription you pay for monthly, and if you're really someone who wants to get into Payday, then you're much better off doing a bit of research as to which DLCs you'd maybe want to try, and waiting for everything to go on sale, because it will go on sale and ultimately be cheaper than having $5 chipped off your bank account for months on end.</p>
