			<p><strong>Funcom</strong> has announced that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune: Awakening Chapter 3</a></strong>, the game's <strong>biggest update yet</strong>, is <strong>live now</strong>. This patch continues the main story following the events of Chapter 2 and <strong>significantly revamps the previously lackluster endgame content</strong>, introducing numerous new locations, systems, and gear. Wccftech watched a remote presentation by the developer to learn the key details and features of Chapter 3; you can read our in-depth report below.</p>

<h2 id="landsraad-overhaul">New Landsraad Mission System</h2>



<p>To start, <strong>the Landsraad system has been completely overhauled</strong>. It is now a contest between the Atreides and the Harkonnen to gain support from minor Houses. Previously, players gained standing by manually submitting resources, but this has been replaced by the new Landsraad Mission system, where missions are grouped into five distinct categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Crafting</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gathering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Combat</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sabotage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These missions will lead Dune: Awakening players to various maps and reward them with a new type of Experience Point (XP) specific to their category. Upon accepting a mission, <strong>players can choose which noble house will receive the standing gained from their success</strong>.</p>



<p>The XP earned through Landsraad missions opens a new endgame progression path called <strong>Specializations</strong>. Players can unlock and purchase various traits using a small amount of <strong>Refined Spice Melange</strong>. These Specializations serve the purpose of allowing players to customize their characters based on their preferred playstyle, such as increasing headshot damage in the combat track or yield rates in the gathering track.</p>



<p>These upgrade tracks go up to level 100. Upon reaching level 75, players receive a unique helmet to show off their expertise in that field. Progression is capped at 35 missions' worth of specialization XP per week, effectively allowing for up to five missions per day.</p>

<h2 id="new-pve-dungeons">New PvE Dungeons(Imperial Testing Stations)</h2>



<p>Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also expands the world of Arrakis: several new locations have been added, including the <strong>Ardent Garrison</strong> and <strong>Smuggler's Run</strong>. Another side of the endgame improvements is the long-anticipated introduction of five new <strong>Imperial Testing Stations</strong>, which function as themed PvE dungeons. Each station is centered around a specific hazard or element:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radiation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Electricity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Poison</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These dungeons are instance-based and can be tackled solo or in a group. <strong>The number of enemies scales with party size</strong>, and players can manually adjust the difficulty level. Higher difficulty levels scale enemy health, damage, and environmental hazards (such as increased electrical damage) while increasing drop rates for high-quality loot.</p>



<p><strong>Each testing station features a unique boss with distinct mechanics</strong>. For instance, Funcom showed that the boss in the electrical dungeon uses a disruptor pistol, and the combat arena features increasingly difficult environmental puzzles as the fight progresses. Boss health bars are split into four phases; the boss becomes immune during phase transitions as the room's hazards shift.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>I specifically asked whether there were any group mechanics, and the developers replied that there aren't</strong>. Which makes sense, I guess, since the dungeons are soloable. It is, however, disappointing for those specifically looking to get a PvE MMORPG-style experience; since they are fundamentally designed to work with just one player, they are unlikely to pose a serious challenge to a coordinated group, even if the number of enemies scales with the group size.</p>



<p>PvE players who are going to be exploring these dungeons can expect to find schematics for <strong>Augmentations</strong>, a new system for improving gear. These Augments can be applied to <strong>Tier 6 (Endgame)</strong> melee weapons, ranged weapons, and armor. The ability to apply multiple augments is tied to the <strong>Crafting Specialization</strong> level. For example, a level 10 crafter can apply an augment to their armor, with more slots unlocking at higher levels. Furthermore, Augments can be traded with friends, shared within guilds, or sold on the Exchange at social hubs.</p>

<h2 id="story-weapons-qol">Story Progression, New Weapons, and QoL Tweaks</h2>



<p>As briefly mentioned earlier, Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also advances the plot as players pursue a murderer revealed to be a <strong>Face Dancer</strong>. Their investigation eventually leads to a <strong>Harkonnen Dueling Ring</strong>, where the Face Dancer is suspected of being the arena champion. Players must fight through various bosses, such as <strong>Thrax the Flamer</strong>, to reach the top of the ranks. The story will also introduce the leader of the <strong>Smugglers</strong> at their headquarters on Arrakis.</p>



<p>The patch also introduces two brand new weapons, the <strong>Pyrocket</strong> and the <strong>Dual Blades</strong>. The former is an area-of-effect (AoE) weapon dropped by the fire dungeon boss, while the latter is a fast melee weapon with a unique move set that consumes less stamina. Moreover, the Rapier weapon type has been completely reworked with new animations, flourishes, and a fencing-style parry-and-reposte mechanic.</p>



<p>The developers then highlighted that they've also introduced several quality-of-life (QoL) improvements, most of which were requested by the community. First and foremost is <strong>the complete removal of the tax system that required players to pay a tax to maintain their bases in the game</strong>. Additionally, players can now use the Base Backup Tool to store their entire base, allowing them to take a break from the game and redeploy it upon their return. Players can now also apply house swatches (color schemes) to crafting machines, containers, vehicles, and wind turbines, showing their allegiance more clearly. As a way to entice some of the lapsed players to return, the developers are also giving away the free <strong>Welcome Back Pack bundle</strong>, which provides resources, gear, and vehicles based on the player's previous research progression.</p>

<p>During this presentation, Funcom <strong>provided no updates on the console ports</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they previously said would be released around a year after the PC launch</a>. If that's still the case, they're only about four months away, but they could still slip a bit. We'll let you know once Funcom shares an official release date.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">toppling <strong>Steam</strong> anytime soon</a>, but the numbers shared by Epic in its <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">Epic Games Store 2025 Year in Review blog post</a> clearly show that the digital storefront is growing. The digital storefront best known for giving away <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">free games</a></strong> also saw quite a few players doing more than just claiming a free title each week, spending more time and money in third-party titles.</p>



<p>2025 was a year of record-setting for the EGS, as player spending on third-party games grew by <strong>57% compared to last year</strong>, reaching a record-high <strong>$400 million</strong>. Epic also added that the $400M number doesn't even include what players would've spent in third-party titles that process their own payments, like <strong>EA Sports FC 26, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, </strong>and <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>. </p>



<p>Developers behind those games, and any other that has its own payment processing, receive 100% of the revenue made from those purchases. Which, frankly, is what you would expect, seeing as how Epic spent <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/">years in litigation against <strong>Apple</strong> over the issue of not being able to process its own payments in <strong>Fortnite</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Other record-setting numbers include the <strong>2.78 billion hours players spent in third-party games</strong> through the Epic Games Store, an increase from 2024's 2.68 billion hours in third-party titles. That said, when looking at gameplay hours spent overall, players logged only <strong>6.65 billion hours,</strong> a decline from 2024's 7.72 billion hours.</p>



<p>It also reached a record-setting high in <strong>monthly active users (MAU)</strong>, hitting <strong>78 million MAU on PC in December 2025</strong>. Overall, player spending was up by 6%, reaching $1.16 billion, up from 2024's $1.09 billion. There are now over <strong>6,000 games</strong> available on the Epic Games Store for players to purchase. </p>



<p>When it comes to the Free Games Program, which seems to be driving a fair amount of engagement on the storefront, Epic gave away <strong>100 games</strong> in 2025, with players claiming a total of <strong>662 million copies</strong>. The value of the games claimed, in US dollars, totalled <strong>$2,316</strong>. The post also notes that the free games increased engagement in those titles on Steam, which feels like a nod towards a story from last month, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">an indie publisher noted that having their game go free on the EGS was great advertising for Steam sales.</a></p>



<p>Lastly, the EGS grew from 2024's 295M users to a whopping <strong>317 million users on PC</strong>. If you want to compare all of the EGS's numbers from 2024 to 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/">you can check out its 2024 report here.</a></strong></p>



<p>As for what Epic has planned in 2026, the Fortnite company says it will focus on "<em>delivering long-requested features and deeper platform improvements</em>," specifically citing that the company is in the process of "<em>rebuilding the underlying architecture of the Epic Games Store Launcher</em>," with plans to ship these changes in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The changes promise a more responsive launcher that feels "<em>good to use</em>," with better stability and faster load times. It also promises community spaces in the Epic Games Store and the enhancement of the EGS's social capabilities, even adding voice chat and game-independent parties. It'll also add cross-platform libraries between PC and mobile games, and the introduction of regional storefronts with localized discovery systems.</p>



<p>"<em>In short: we're building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play</em>."</p>
