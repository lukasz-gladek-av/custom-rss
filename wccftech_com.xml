			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now supports the PlayStation 5's power saver mode, and its implementation is among the most interesting to date, according to a new technical analysis.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> examined how the two entries in the Kojima Productions series support Power Saver Mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">a newly introduced operating mode for the PlayStation 5 console</a> that cuts CPU resources in half, halves the memory bandwidth, and reduces CPU and GPU clocks to reduce the system's power consumption.</p>



<p>While the implementation in Death Stranding: Director's Cut was not particularly challenging, as it is the enhanced port of a PlayStation 4 game, things get more interesting in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. According to Digital Foundry, Power Saver mode in the second entry in the series, at a glance, only runs the game in Performance Mode while capping the framerate to 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>A closer look, however, reveals some interesting details. Tessellation and geometry, for example, are in line with that seen in Quality Mode, while the resolution is kept at 1440p, although with dynamic resolution scaling in place. This approach is interesting in how the developer worked around the constraints to balance the reduced framerate, possibly caused by the CPU limitations, with increased fidelity in some instances over Performance mode.</p>



<p>Seeing how Kojima Productions handled Power Saver Mode support in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach again raises the question of why so much effort is being put into supporting an operating mode that will likely see very little use. According to Digital Foundry, this could be a way to prepare developers for a certain level of expected flexibility required to scale games on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">rumored PlayStation handheld.</a></p>



<p>As is, however, the current Power Saver Mode shouldn't be considered as an early showcase of what the rumored PlayStation handheld will deliver, as a 115W power target is way too high for a device that will likely target between 15 and 25W, and the resolution of all the games currently supporting Power Saver Mode is way too high for a portable device, usually 1440p if not even higher in some instances. This further reinforces how supporting Power Save Mode is mostly preparation work for the rumored handheld.</p>

<p>Among the few PlayStation 5 games supporting Power Saver Mode besides Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is the Demon's Souls Remake by Bluepoint Games.

			<p>EA is pushing its employees to use AI for basically every task, but the results can be flawed, resulting in more work for developers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> recently talked with current EA staff, who confirmed that the company's leadership has spent the past year or so pushing its 15,000 employees to use AI for virtually every task, from producing code and concept art for games to advising managers how to speak to staff about a certain number of topics, including pay or promotions.</p>



<p>The AI tools used to produce code are among those creating the most issues for developers. It is reported that these tools produce flawed code that requires manual fixing. Other developers are concerned about the AI software training they are expected to do with their own work, which could decrease the demand for concept artists and level designers.</p>



<p>Heavy AI usage also puts QA roles at risk. One former employee at Respawn, one of EA's biggest studios, said that they were laid off this Spring, along with around 100 other employees, because the company was using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, work previously conducted by human employees like the ones that were fired.</p>



<p>Although heavy AI usage in game development and related tasks poses a real danger to jobs in the field, not every developer is against its use. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, believes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">using generative AI can improve efficiency and make large-scale development sustainable</a> in the current age, especially in Japan, where the talent pool is getting smaller and smaller. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series, also has a positive view on generative AI, seeing it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">way to boost efficiency while he can focus on the creative part of game development. </a></p>
