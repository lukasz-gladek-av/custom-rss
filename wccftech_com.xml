			<p>Today, NCSoft and Amazon Games announced that a new weapon type will be released very soon, on December 5, for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty: the spear. In a dedicated video, the developers went into what makes it unique compared to other melee weapons already in the game:</p>
<p><em>The spear is a fire-attribute close-range weapon. Although it's a melee weapon, you can gain combat advantages through its long reach and pocking plays with throwing mechanics. It enables combo-based combat with fast-tempo skills and has initiating skills that allow you to leap into battle instantly. Overall, it's a hybrid weapon that can fulfill both Tank and DPS roles – what we might call a Bruiser or Fighter – designed specifically for these roles. The existing four Ranged weapons have been performing relatively well in combat by utilizing distance advantages and positional elements.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, we needed a weapon that could change the tide of battle. The Spear's image started from concepts like Warrior, Berserker, and Assault Captain. It has defensive characteristics, good mobility, and many utility skills. We designed it to have strategic value on the battlefield. You can look forward to Spear skills useful for dealing with multiple opponents, combat through distance control, and special Spear-specific skills.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful debut outside of Korea</a> (even in the face of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal restructuring at NCSoft</a>), Throne and Liberty just received four new endgame 2-Star Dungeons last week: Carmine Rage Island, Voidwastes, Island of Terror, and Valley of Slaughter.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Amazon Games Globalization Design Manager Daniel Lafuente (whom we interviewed before the game's launch) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y91MABfDFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the new PvP War Games feature will be introduced to Throne and LIberty on December 5 as well.</p>
<p><em>War Games provides a custom Lobby feature for Conquest battles or Rift Stones and Boon Stones. Within the War Games menu, players can create their custom lobby, selecting what stone they want to fight over, the number of teams that will fight, and the size of each team. Then players join in, and once the lobby is full, you start the match. My favorite thing is you can do private and public matches, so we think the use cases for players is going to be that huge competitive PVP guilds can use it for practices, while less competitive guilds can do inner Guild skirmishes with their friends.</em></p>
<p>There won't be any rewards related to War Games for the time being, but that might change in the future after Amazon and NCSoft have gathered the community's feedback.</p>

			<p>This afternoon, CD Projekt RED VP and Game Director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?t=qKSrHnijalfbeBpYM8C1lw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via Twitter (X) that The Witcher 4 is officially in full scale production after recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending</a> the pre-production phase. He also shared his confidence that the new saga could be a remarkable experience for fans.</p>
<p><em>I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!⚔️</em></p>
<p>Kalemba shared a picture with the tweet. This could be our very first look at The Witcher 4.</p>

<p>We first heard of the new game over two and a half years ago when CD Projekt RED also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>they were abandoning their own REDEngine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. At the time, they called it a true partnership where they would also contribute back to the game-making tool. CTO Paweł Zawodny said:</p>
<p><em>From the outset, we did not consider a typical licensing arrangement; both we and Epic see this as a long-term, fulfilling tech partnership. It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible phase as; in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release. This cooperation is so exciting, because it will elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools. I can’t wait for the great games we’re going to create using Unreal Engine 5!</em></p>
<p>The switch could speed up the development of future games, but that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-not-speeding-development-cdpr-hopes-helps-in-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't apply</a> to The Witcher 4, since the team is still familiarizing itself with the new tool. When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-aims-to-go-beyond-current-rpgs-says-cdpr-itll-be-a-good-entry-point-for-new-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the new installment last year, Sebastian Kalemba teased that the studio aims to surpass current RPGs with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-wont-just-retread-the-last-game-adding-new-features-and-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features and mechanics</a> that break boundaries. Moreover, the new The Witcher game will be a great entry point for newcomers.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> the first actor who will work on the game. That info also revealed how voice-over and motion capture will begin in 2025. It's hard to say exactly when The Witcher 4 could launch, but it will be at least a couple more years if not more. Until then, you can beautify The Witcher 3 NextGen Edition with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HalkHogan's definitive texture mod</a>.</p>
