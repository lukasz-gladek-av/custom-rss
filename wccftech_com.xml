			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/">Variety</a> regarding the mass layoffs at Microsoft today, everything shown at Xbox's Summer Showcase is "<em>continuing on</em>." Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty also confirmed earlier today that Xbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">40+ projects currently in active development</a>, following the cancellation of Perfect Dark and Everwild.</p>



<p>Xbox had plenty to show off during its Summer Showcase as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, Grounded 2, new DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, new gameplay for Gears of War: Reloaded and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/">Clockwork Revolution</a>. And if Variety's sources are to be believed, all those projects, and every other first-party project shown during that showcase, are safe from today's cuts and cancellations. </p>



<p>That's not to say the studios working on those games haven't suffered layoffs, just that the projects themselves are safe. The mass layoffs at Microsoft today are across the whole company, not just the gaming division, and with exact details on who has been cut and how many have been laid off still unknown, we can't say for sure that no one at Obsidian, for example, didn't lose their job today. </p>

<p>The details on Microsoft's mass layoff today are still developing. While several of the cuts have been confirmed, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild getting cancelled,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark being cancelled along with The Initiative shutting down</a>, unconfirmed reports continue to circulate. Forza Motorsport developer Turn10, has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l">reportedly lost 50% of its staff</a>, though that remains unconfirmed at the time of this writing.</p>
