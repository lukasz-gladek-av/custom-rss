			<p>Swedish developer Fatshark has announced that Warhammer Vermintide 2 has welcomed over 500K new players in the launch week of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Versus</a> PvP mode, breathing new life into the game. Warhammer Vermintide 2 originally launched in March 2018 for PC, then July 2018 for Xbox, and December 2018 for PlayStation 4. By early 2019, it had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/vermintide-2-surpassed-two-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> two million players.</p>
<p>Fatshark certainly wouldn't want to waste this new renaissance for the six-year-old game. Indeed, there's a content plan in place, with a new free DLC called Verminous Dreams on the way. The first level will be released on December 9, alongside the Gifts of the Wolf Father event, and other improvements to Versus mode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Warhammer Vermintide 2 is 95% off on Steam until November 26. The Content Bundle is also 72% off, bringing its price down from €138.79 to €38.76. Here's what's included:</p>

It is up to the five heroes to stop them before a dreadful disaster strikes the Empire.</li>
<li>Back to Ubersreik DLC. The second DLC for Vermintide 2 sends you back to Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide with 3 remastered Ubersreik levels.</li>
