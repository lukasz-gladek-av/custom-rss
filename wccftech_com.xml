			<p>NVIDIA announced that its cloud streaming platform GeForce NOW was updated with 11 PC games this week. The highlights are undoubtedly Hunt: Showdown 1896 and Forever Skies.</p>
<p>The former is Crytek's popular horror-themed extraction shooter. Originally released in 2019, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-launched</a> in August 2024 with several updates to the CryEngine version. The game now supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available via GeForce NOW if you have a premium subscription, DirectX 12, HDR displays, multi-bounce global illumination, and more. Earlier this year, Crytek <a href="https://wccftech.com/crytek-lays-off-15-of-its-400-employees-will-focus-on-expanding-hunt-showdown-1896-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> a substantial (15%) portion of its workforce. Development of a new Crysis game was put on hold, but Hunt: Showdown 1896 continues to be regularly updated due to its healthy player base. A new DLC called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3415590/Hunt_Showdown_1896__Last_of_the_Herd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last of the Herd</a> is due to be released soon, adding the Plains Warden playable character and a new Hunting Bow, the Herd Thinner.</p>
<p>As for Forever Skies, Far From Home's first-person sci-fi survival game finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-has-launched-out-of-early-access-1-0-available-on-ps5-and-pc-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> version 1.0 after nearly two full years of early access. Update 1.0 added the final chapter of the game's story, new points of interest and biomes to explore, new colossal creatures, new collections (artifacts and murals) and cosmetic rewards, new tools, resources, and crafting recipes, various quality of live improvements, and improved performance including NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (available on GeForce NOW for Ultimate tier subscribers).</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be about to get some new playable characters on PC, judging from a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@d3dnier398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3DNieR</a>, shows the Turks Reno and Rude controlled by the player, complete with all of their abilities in their boss battles. Although it's clear that there's still more work to be done for a proper implementation, as Reno's voice doesn't work and every unique ability of the two characters doesn't require any ATB, both characters work remarkably well already, which is quite impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Playable Reno &amp; Rude Test | [REBIRTH]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH2S9LnksUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release on PC earlier this year, plenty of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth have been released online, introducing improvements and new features not available in the vanilla game, such as the ability to increase the party size limit past three members and a<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/">dd temporary characters like Zack and Sephiroth to the party</a>, making them playable outside the small segments they are supposed to in the vanilla game. This party mod also allows players to add Cid and Vincent to the party, although the two characters aren't playable as they have no moveset, an issue that crashes the game whenever they are added to the frontline party.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has yet to be officially announced, but the work of a dedicated user is providing a better look at the unannounced remaster today.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesIV4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JamesIV4</a> restored some of the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oblivion-remastered-dark-screenshots-restored-KscfaBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots</a> that leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a>, which were considerably darker than others as they were likely intended as a backdrop for things like store pages or banners, as the user pointed out. Every location shown in the screenshots looks gorgeous in the restored images, but the night skybox in the Dock at night screenshot looks particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Following months of rumors and speculation, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was proven to be real earlier this week, when the aforementioned screenshots leaked online via the Virtuos official website. While there was no need for another confirmation that the game is real, mentions of the remaster have recently been discovered on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Bethesda website</a>, so all that is truly left is an official announcement and launch, which should happen sometime next week, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">multiple insiders.</a></p>
<p>2025 is going to be a remarkable year for fans of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, as fans will likely be able to experience a recreation of the game in Skyrim with the Skyblivion project, regardless of the launch of Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Yesterday</a>, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize commented on how the official remaster will not impact the passion-fueled project as long as Bethesda allows it to exist.</p>
