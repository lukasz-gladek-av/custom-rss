			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will not launch this year in Central America or the Caribbean, the Japanese company confirmed with local distributors.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.teletica.com/gamer/nintendo-confirma-que-no-lanzara-la-switch-2-en-centroamerica-ni-el-caribe_383685">Teletica</a>, Nintendo confirmed their next-generation console, alongside games and peripherals, will not hit the two regions this year during a meeting held with local distributors yesterday. The company reportedly decided to delay the console's launch as Central America and the Caribbean are considered too small markets to justify an official release. As such, those living in the two regions won't have any other option other than importing from the United States or other regions for a much higher price than what would have been the around $610 price that was expected for the two regions.</p>
<p>Considering the high demand for the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be very difficult for players living in regions where the system won't officially launch to get their hands on the system, unless they are willing to pay exorbitant prices. While the console is priced a little higher than most expected, the wealth of features it offers and the solid launch lineup have made the Nintendo Switch 2 an extremely enticing purchase. You can learn more about what the system will offer when it releases on June 5th in Nathan's hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A big new Nintendo Switch update (version 20.0.0) <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped today</a>, adding several features introduced mostly in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The Virtual Game Cards and GameShare features are easily the most important. Here's what Nintendo had to say about how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Virtual Game Card</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Purchased Nintendo Switch digital software, DLC, and some free software are now virtual game cards and displayed in a list in this menu.</em></li>
<li><em>You can virtually load and eject virtual game cards between up to two Nintendo Switch systems.</em></li>
<li><em>Virtual game cards can be lent to others in the same Nintendo Account family group. For more information, see&nbsp;Virtual Game Card Guide.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>GameShare</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Compatible software can be shared from a Switch 2 system to other nearby system(s) to play together.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>You can only play together via local wireless, and the Switch 2 system must initiate GameShare.</em></li>
<li><em>This feature cannot be used between two Switch, Switch – OLED Model, and/or Switch Lite systems.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new User Verification feature has also been added to ensure that access to the Virtual Game Card menu can be restricted via PIN or signing in to your Nintendo Account. Furthermore, with the addition of Online License Settings, users can play downloaded software or DLC they purchased (as long as the system is connected to the Internet) even if they don't have the virtual game card loaded.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the functionality to transfer saves between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 has been implemented. Users can perform a system transfer using local communication; however, both the local and server-based system transfer services require an Internet connection and a Nintendo Account. Multiple saves can also be selected and transferred at once in the dedicated menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>For users who will lose access to their Switch before receiving their Switch 2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server, which can then be retrieved on their Switch 2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month from its planned June 6 debut in stores. In the meantime, check out our recap article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or our hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/housemarque-celebrates-4th-returnal-anniversary-with-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Housemarque has <a href="https://x.com/Housemarque/status/1917443799619342788?t=UpfDraahAgVZfbzeHhoBqQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the 4th anniversary</a> of Returnal with the release of the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro patch. The studio didn't go into much detail about the improvements, though they did say the patch offers up to 2.5x higher resolution than the base PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-returnal-absolute-housemarque" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry's analysis of the game on PS5</a>, Returnal originally rendered the game at native 1080p, then used temporal reconstruction up to 1440p, and finally added a checkerboard rendering pass to reach 4K output. So, it sounds like the PS5 Pro version might now output native 4K resolution, although we'll have to wait for a new analysis to get confirmation.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Returnal was so successful that it single-handedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convinced Sony to acquire Housemarque</a>. The game earned a 9.3/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>
<p>Despite the game's success, Housemarque is not making a sequel to Returnal. Instead, they are crafting a brand new sci-fi IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Saros</a>. The developers claim this will be the 'ultimate evolution' of their trademark action gameplay when it ships next year on PlayStation 5. The game still uses the roguelike framework seen in Returnal, but this time around, Housemarque will let players keep permanent resources and progression, making deaths more bearable.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> they could never have made a game like Saros if they had remained independent. It reportedly has a budget similar to Alan Wake 2's (around €70 million).</p>
