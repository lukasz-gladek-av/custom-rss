			<p>Paris-based developer Streum On Studio has <a href="https://x.com/StreumOnStudio/status/1933543316076830784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split</a> from fellow French publisher Focus Entertainment, becoming independent once again.</p>
<p>Streum On Studio was founded in 2007 by a few developers who had worked together on a Half-Life mod called Syndicate Black Ops. Their first game, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy, launched on July 29, 2011 on PC. It's a first-person action roleplaying game powered by the Source engine and set in a dystopian cyberpunk world based on a private tabletop RPG. In the game, the titular E.Y.E is an armed branch of the Secreta Secretorum that attempts a coup against the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of worlds and planets that rules with an iron fist.</p>
<p>E.Y.E itself is plagued by internal conflict between the Jian and Culter factions, the latter of which is the one the player character belongs to. Their loyalties are torn between their superior, Commander Rimanah, and the Secreta's chief separatist with unstoppable ambition, and the 'Mentor', your friend and instructor. The 'Mentor' tries to unite the two rival factions at all costs. Players are thus thrust into the middle of a fratricidal war fraught with political conspiracies and quests for power, involving different groups and megacorporations.</p>
<p>Following this first release, Streum On Studio turned to Warhammer 40,000 with the first-person shooter&nbsp;<span>games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/space-hulk-deathwing-review-lost-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Hulk: Deathwing</a>, released in 2016, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/necromunda-hired-gun-buggy-trip-underhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necromunda: Hired Gun</a>, which debuted in 2021. Following this latest game launch,</span>&nbsp;Focus Entertainment acquired the studio, but it only lasted four years. Now, the developer has bought back its shares to return to independence.</p>

<p>The development team has already teased their next project with a brief trailer we've embedded above. Streum On Studio plans to debut the game's world premiere at some point this Summer; with Summer Game Fest already gone, it appears likely that the announcement will take place at Gamescom, the biggest European gaming event. This year, it's set to take place at the usual venue (Cologne's Koelnmesse) between August 19 and 24.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrj7u74vi22v?ref_src=embed">2025-06-13T19:57:22.329Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>
