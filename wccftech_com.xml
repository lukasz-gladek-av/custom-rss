			<p>Techland's latest mainline installment in its Dying Light series, Dying Light: The Beast, is finally here, and players can leap into the infected-ridden resort town and forest area of Castor Woods with returning protagonist Kyle Crane back at the helm.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and it was my first time diving into the series, which means that everything that was old hat for series veterans was brand new to me.</p>



<p>It also means there were a few things I would've appreciated knowing about Dying Light: The Beast before jumping in, which is why this guide will aim to give you five things to know about diving into Techland's latest zombie-riddled adventure.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-starter-guide-5-things-to-know-about-leaping-into-castor-woods">Dying Light: The Beast Starter Guide - 5 Things to Know About Leaping Into Castor Woods</h2>



<h3 id="h-don-t-go-out-at-night-at-least-not-right-away">Don't go out at night - at least not right away</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>A key part of the Dying Light series is its day-and-night cycle, and the terrors that you can face when the sun goes down, compared to when it's high in the sky. Going out at night is a core part of the Dying Light experience, and the tense moments you experience while being chased by one or multiple Volatile's on your way to a safe zone are where some of the best gameplay moments come from.</p>



<p>But they can also be the source of the most frustrating, if you're not prepared. That's why once you've reached the Town Hall and you're let loose in Old Town in Castor Woods, do yourself a favour and spend some time avoiding the night. Take advantage of not having to deal with Volatile's during the day and unlock the safe zones in Old Town before you start exploring the area at night.</p>



<p>Getting killed by Volatile's and losing a bunch of XP early on while you're trying to level up and gain some key skills, like being able to jump kick zombies isn't how you want to spend your early hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-craft-your-bow-and-keep-it-upgraded">Craft your bow and keep it upgraded</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first ranged weapon you'll get in the game is the Hunting Bow, and getting it crafted and in your inventory is something you'll want to do as soon as possible. It'll be on the first workbench you find in the game, which is Techland basically signposting it to you as something to get in your inventory right away, but you probably won't have the materials for it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's an easy fix, as the required materials aren't too difficult to scavenge. Once you have it in your inventory, it's also worth keeping it upgraded as much as possible. Particularly when you're taking on human enemies throughout the game, your bow is key to ensuring stealth-focused scenarios go well.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-bandage-flashlight-and-throwing-knife-blueprints">Upgrade your bandage, flashlight, and throwing knife blueprints</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll be upgrading your gear and swapping out weapons over the course of Dying Light: The Beast, but the upgrades you'll want to really prioritize are your blueprint upgrades. Specifically the blueprints for your bandages, UV flashlight, and throwing knives.</p>



<p>Upgrading the blueprints for each item makes them more effective, and in the case of throwing knives, lets you craft more of them without using as many resources.</p>



<p>These three items are the ones you will likely use more than any other during your time in Castor Woods, and upgrading their blueprints as quickly as you can will have you set up for the endgame well before you get there.</p>



<h3 id="h-mash-that-survivor-sense-at-all-times">Mash that Survivor Sense at all times</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Areas like this can look devoid of resources, until your Survivor Sense reveals otherwise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Survivor Sense ability can be occasionally helpful for keeping track of enemies nearby, human and zombie alike, but what it's really key for is telling you where resources are near you. You'll want to keep mashing the survivor sense as much as you can, because you're otherwise liable to miss scores of resources that you'll need for upgrading your gear and for crafting the resources you need while out in the wilds of Castor Woods.</p>



<h3 id="h-you-don-t-need-to-fight-everyone-and-everything">You don't need to fight everyone and everything</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>Particularly, if you're like me, you might feel like you need to wipe every zombie you see off the board when you see them. Absolutely not the case - it's good to keep your aggression meter up so that you can launch into Beast mode quickly when you do get into a big fight, so picking off a few zombies here and there isn't a bad idea.</p>



<p>But you absolutely don't need to fight every zombie you come across, and you're better off not trying to. Besides the fact that your weapons will deteriorate faster, you'll more than likely find yourself getting overwhelmed with all the noise you're making, and then you're back in the position of losing XP for no good reason.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you're a Dying Light veteran, than most of this was probably old hat for you, but if you were like me and are playing The Beast without having checked out the previous games, than these tips will help you start off your journey through Castor Woods on the right foot.</p>

			<p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda is a developer who needs no introduction for those who have a deep appreciation for Japanese games. His development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, has created some of the most memorable action games ever, such as the No More Heroes series.</p>



<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a>, the Japanese studio is releasing Romeo is a Dead Man, an action game with a very distinct identity that instantly feels familiar to all those who played a game directed by Suda51.</p>



<p>Right after <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">trying out the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, I had the opportunity to sit down with Suda51 to discuss the main inspiration behind the game's wacky story, how swordplay and gunplay will be balanced, the game's level design, and more. You can find our chat below.</p>



<p><span><b><i>NOTE: The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</i></b></span></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man has been called an <em>“ultra‑violent science‑fiction action game.”</em> You are no stranger to gore, but what has inspired you to bring it to a sci-fi setting?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> When I want to make a new game, I always think: <em>"What can I do to make people get interested?"</em> For Romeo is a Dead Man, when I was thinking about the game's introduction and how to make it interesting, I thought of Back to the Future, and the relationship between Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown. The relationship between Romeo and his grandfather Benjamin mirrors their relationship, but with a twist.</p>



<p>I wondered, what would have happened if Marty had died at the start of <em>Back to the Future</em>? I imagined Doc would try to save him — by traveling into the future. That idea inspired the introduction for Romeo is a Dead Man. After this, I started thinking about how things would go on, and the whole game concept grew from this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo Stargazer is a unique protagonist, an FBI agent tracking criminals across space-time. What made you choose an FBI agent as your main character? What does his background bring to the experience?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> In the world of Romeo is a Dead Man, criminals travel between different time periods and parts of the universe, ignoring the laws of space-time to commit all sorts of crimes. If there are space-time criminals and fugitives, there would be space-time police too. And what would these guys be?</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of TV series by Dick Wolf <em>(Law &amp; Order, FBI franchise)</em>, the FBI came to mind, but how could FBI agents become space-time agents? With this question in mind, I came up with the background setting. J. Edgar Hoover, the first head of the FBI, discovers that there are space-time fugitives. He then somehow travels to the past to create this space-time division within the FBI, traveling through space-time to bring these criminals in.</p>



<p>While this background setting isn't in the game, this is how I decided to make Romeo an FBI space-time agent. For the rest of the game, I tried imagining how would a show based on this premise be, and went on from there.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The concept behind Romeo is a Dead man grew out of a "what-if" scenario based on Back to the Future.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo being a dead man is the central hook of the story, but has his peculiar status influenced the experience beyond just the story?</p>



<p>A: Romeo's status as a dead man has influenced combat, for the most part. When he first gets killed at the start of the game and his grandfather Benjamin puts the helmet on him, Romeo is not only saved, but becomes a "hyperfied" human, elevating from being just another dead man to The Dead Man. This also allows him to use all the different weapons and skills he has in the game, much more efficiently than a regular human ever could.</p>



<p>Q: Speaking about weapons, playing the demo, I couldn't help but notice in this small slice of the game how short-range melee weapons seem to be favored over gunplay, which felt effective mostly against flying, hard-to-reach enemies. How is the full game balanced, in this regard? Will the player be able to use any weapon type and still succeed?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> That's a pretty sharp observation. In general, the player is free to use whatever weapon they want, so both melee and ranged weapons can get the job done, but depending on the enemy type, you may want to prefer one type over the other.</p>



<p>However, some bigger enemies and bosses require the player to use both. These enemies have weak points that are difficult to reach with a melee weapon, so the player has to use guns to hit them, and then close in with short range weapons once the opportunity arises. In many ways, the combat experience is built like a loop where you cycle between weapons, and build up resources to use skills.</p>



<p>Generally, Romeo is a Dead Man leans a bit more towards close-up melee fighting, but aside from specific cases, the player can use whatever they find more comfortable to use. It was a consciuous game design from the very beginning.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> From the demo, I noticed the stage felt pretty big, but it was still a closed-off stage. So is the entire game this linear?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> It's completely linear. Maps can get big, but there's no open-world progression whatsoever. We did try an open-world approach, but we got rid of that pretty early on in the development process.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>While it leans more towards close-range fighting, Romeo is a Dead Man allows players to use any weapon type to succeed.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Although the game does feel different, I couldn't help but notice a certain similarity to the No More Heroes. Besides the linearity of Romeo is A Dead Man versus the open-world approach of Travis Touchdown's adventures, what would you say is the most prominent feature that differentiates the games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Besides the different progression, I'd say the setting is the biggest difference. In Romeo is a Dead Man, the keyword is space.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is powered by Unreal Engine 5 like a good number of modern games. Is there anything the engine allowed you to do that couldn't have been done before? Anything that the engine made easier to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> There are a lot of things for sure, but I really can't get into specifics. The technical team would be able to provide deeper information on this, but I'm sure there are a lot of things that the engine made it easier to do.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is your first IP in a very long time, and you are launching a brand new game in a market where most developers rely on established series. Why did you decide to do so? Do you feel launching a new IP nowadays is more challenging than in the past?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The proliferation of sequels and remakes isn't just seen in games but also in movies. Personally, I think this marks the current age, but it won't be like this forever. As time goes on, things will go back to the way they were before, when developers were more interested in creating new games than sequels or remakes.</p>



<p>As a developer, me and Grasshopper, we like creating new original games and working on the series we have done in the past in equal measure. There's a chance we will develop a sequel to any of our series at some point. But we will also continue making new and original games as well.</p>



<p>I personally don't think too much about making a new game or a new entry in our series. I just want to make the kind of games we want to make, regardless if a specific time favors sequels and remakes or new games. This is something that tends to change over time, and doesn't influence what we do too much.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>With its blend of time-bending chaos, quirky humor, and looped combat that rewards both melee and ranged play, Romeo is a Dead Man promises to be a signature Suda51 experience - unpredictable, stylish, and unlike anything else in the action genre today. Players can expect plenty of surprises when it launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
