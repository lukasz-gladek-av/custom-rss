			<p>Bloober Team (recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a remake of the first Silent Hill) has published a new developer diary to show off the combat mechanics of its next game, Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p>The developers said they are putting a lot of emphasis on a tactical combat experience. Players will have to remain cautious and alert at all times because the game's enemies, the Orphans, can merge with each other. When players kill an enemy, the defeated foe can become fuel for other enemies to be absorbed and become stronger. Each encounter in the game is handcrafted, and in some cases, you can use the environment to your own advantage, such as firing at a canister or luring the enemy out into your position, or you can just go into melee and fight them head-on. Even within Bloober Team, some developers play more offensively, while others prefer a more defensive approach. It depends on the loadout, the gameplay style, and how many resources you have.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features different types of weapons, tools, and abilities, so players will have to figure out by themselves what works best for their playstyle. Resource management is also a key in the game. More offensive players may want to craft more ammunition, while defensive players should have more health packs. Like in other survival horror games, there's also a progression tree where players can upgrade the weaponry, the tools, and the suit.</p>

<p>Bloober has also revealed to have devised specific roles for the enemies. There's runners who just run to the player and try to kill him as fast as they can. There are ranged foes who stand behind and shoot, forcing the player to get closer. There are bruisers, 'big ass tanky guys' whose only goal is to grab as much resources they can from you. The team believes these differences will create a lot of unique encounters where players must think, analyze, and decide what would be the best<br>
primary target in each instance.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have a fixed release date yet, but it does have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release window</a>: Fall 2025.</p>
