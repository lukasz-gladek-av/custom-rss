			<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson (also known simply as Notch) was never known to be of the diplomatic sort. Throughout the last thirteen years, he has made several controversial comments via social media, both on the games industry and various social issues. Sticking to the former, back in 2012, he famously gave his permission to a Minecraft fan to pirate the game if he could not afford it at the moment:</p>



<p><em>Just pirate it. If you still like it when you can afford it in the future, buy it then. Also, don‚Äôt forget to feel bad. üòâ</em></p>



<p>At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Persson was even more direct when telling his peers that piracy was not theft. He argued that if people stole a car, there would be one less in the world, whereas pirating a game simply means there is another copy in the world and possibly a new fan.</p>



<p>Now, the Minecraft creator has renewed his thoughts in light of the Stop Killing Games initiative. For context, the online petition is seeking to gather enough signatures to propose a bill to the UK and European parliaments to block game developers and publishers from making games that can eventually be 'killed' by permanently taking down servers. Last week, we covered one such example when Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that all services for BioWare's Anthem would cease on January 12, 2026. From that date onward, the game will be effectively unplayable.</p>



<p>The Stop Killing Games initiative has gained considerable momentum lately and is now nearing 1.3 million signatures, as you can see on the official website. Unsurprisingly, publishers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that if this were ever to pass, it would be 'prohibitively expensive' for them, which sounds like a hidden threat of even further price increases.</p>



<p>It is in this context that Markus Persson said: </p>



<p><em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft.</em></p>



<p>When asked what game developers and publishers should do instead of shutting games down, the Minecraft creator pointed out that old games used to allow players to host their own servers, which effectively kept those games alive even after the actual developer turned off their official servers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gauged the interest of his followers</a> in him getting back to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft. The response seemed positive, although it remains unclear whether this game will actually be made and, if so, when it could launch.</p>



<p>Besides that, do you agree with Persson's opinion on the subject?</p>

			<p>Bethesda has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new patch for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered to the Steam Beta ring. If you wish to download it, just switch to the beta tab in your Steam library.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 introduces a series of fixes to performance, quests, and gameplay. Arguably, the most interesting could be the allegedly reduced frequency of stutters when traversing the open world, which were really dreadful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at launch</a>.

<li>Fixed weather VFX flashing while outside</li>



<li>Fixed motion blur artifacts while in the Oblivion Plane</li>



<li>Fixed NPCs not obeying the Wait action from the player</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Bethesda Game Studios has introduced new difficulty options to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, specifically for Player Combat Damage and Enemy Combat Damage. Players can now select from ‚ÄúNovice‚Äù, ‚ÄúApprentice‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdept‚Äù, ‚ÄúJourneyman‚Äù, ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù options in the Gameplay menu. The developers expressed the hope that the ‚ÄúJourneyman‚Äù setting would act as a better bridge between ‚ÄúAdept‚Äù and ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù for players.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered is currently still 20% off on Steam due <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Summer Sale</a>, but the discount is only available for less than ten hours, so hurry up if you are interested.</p>
