			<p>Today, Techland announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human has been updated to take advantage of the new PS5 Pro console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last week by Sony. The visual improvements empowered by ray tracing and/or higher graphics settings apply to all four presets:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Balanced:</strong> Upscaled 4K at 60 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1512p), improved Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Performance:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K with VRR, up to 120 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections, Spot Shadows, Sub Surface Scattering Quality and Fog Quality.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K at 30 FPS with Ray Tracing. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the perfect time for new PS5 Pro owners to check out the game even if they don't own it. Sony has announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human is part of the new PlayStation Plus lineup and will be available for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers starting Tuesday, November 19.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched </a>in February 2022 to an eight out of ten score here on Wccftech. Here's the final quote from reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human is another exhilarating parkour and zombie-pummeling playground from Techland, although at times, the seams holding it all together are a bit obvious. Given the game’s glitches, minor gameplay annoyances, and crudely bisected story and world, reports of behind-the-scenes issues feel all-too-plausible. That said, the foundation here is rock solid, and Techland has proven they’re capable long-term builders, so I’m confident Dying Light 2’s embers can be stoked to a full flame in time.</em></p>

<p>Since then, Techland has improved the game with nearly twenty big patches in various areas, even adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-reloaded-edition-qa-franchise-director-talks-firearms-10-new-hours-of-gameplay-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firearms</a>. While there are no more story DLCs planned due to the developer's focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, more patches will still be <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for the game in the future.</p>
