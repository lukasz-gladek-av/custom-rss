			<p>Even when it was released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was never a powerhouse hardware, but with some overclocking, the system is capable of achieving impressive scores in some benchmark tests and even running the Dolphin GameCube emulator reasonably well.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> conducted another extreme overclocking test on L4T Ubuntu, effectively putting the Tegra X1 chip on steroids. This made the system achieve some impressive scores in tests such as Membench, Cuda95, and Geekbench 6. The fully overclocked system also runs the Dolphin GameCube/Wii emulator surprisingly well, achieving more than playable framerates at 1080p resolution in Mario Kart Wii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Extreme OC Benchmark on L4T Ubuntu - (Geekbench/glmark2/Dolphin)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRogKHSt5ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the past few months, we got a glimpse of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of doing with overclocking, thanks to a few other tests. One of them proved how an overclocked system modded with<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/"> 8GB of RAM</a> is capable of running<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-above-60-fps/"> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at above 60 FPS at native resolution and even at 30 FPS at 1440p</a>. If the rumors circulating online are correct, the console's successor shouldn't have much trouble running current games with good performance and great image quality, at least in its first few years of availability, thanks to 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which should allow developers to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S</a>, and NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes treated the audience to a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-182-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double Devstream</a> for Warframe and Soulframe, and those interested heard a lot of big news about the titles. The streams provided a lot of information about the franchise and started with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/">huge reveal</a> of Warframe: 1999, being released in December. A 1999 prequel webcomic will be released in November to get fans excited for the upcoming release. Additionally, Xaku Prime Access will begin on November 13.</p>
<p>Xaku is an amalgamation of three forgotten Warframes and is now converging once again. They previously acted as beneficiaries of the Entrati family and were lost to the void. Now they are emerging as Xaku Prime, and two new Prime weapons will also be released alongside them. A Syandana and Operator suit will also be released along with Xaku on November 13.</p>
<p>The comic has been produced in partnership with community artist Karu, and explores the founding of the Hex Syndicate. Additionally, there will be a playable mini-game in the Hollvanian Mall hub, where you can experience a "90s era run n' gun side-scroller," which was developed with Sumo Digital. You'll also be able to customize the Atomicycle with multiple color schemes and 11 upcoming premium skins to make your mode of transport flashy and exciting on the streets of Hollvania.</p>
<p>Trinity and Nyx will be receiving light reworks to make their gameplay experience more enjoyable, with Trinity's passive ability being replaced with other buffs to her other abilities to help make her meta-viable. This comes ahead of their Protoframe appearance in Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The team behind Soulframe provided an update, stating that the Preludes testing access will open up widely in 2025, which will give players a look into the pre-Alpha state of the game. The Devstream also provided new insight into the game, stating that the Preludes invites are continuing to be sent out, with the team continuing to provide access to players. Each player that gets invited to the playtest will get four additional codes that they can share with friends and family so that they don't have to experience the game on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, additional changes to the combat system was mentioned, as well as the ability to acquire skills via weapon usage, changes to player progression, crafting and visual upgrades to the environments that players will get to explore.</p>
<p>During this devstream, they also honored one of the most prominent figures in the Warframe development team, Mike 'Mynki' Brennan. He was the first Art Director for Warframe, and helped provide great designs to the franchise and made Warframe the iconic IP that it is today. You can read his <a href="https://www.digitalextremes.com/news/remembering-mike-mynki-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full obituary</a> on the Digital Extremes website, where they dedicate Warframe: 1999 to him.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Has Drawn in Most Traffic Ever For a Game Launch in the UK]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk.1021143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't a surprise that people would be excited for the new Call of Duty game, as the franchise has been a mainstay in the gaming industry for years. To celebrate the launch, Activision has put a lot of work into the marketing for the game, and it's claimed by the UK network EE and BT that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has drawn the largest traffic ever for a game launch in the country. If this is true, this is a huge milestone for the franchise and for Activision, but it also doesn't come as much of a surprise, considering how much Activision spent on marketing for this game.</p>
<p>What does come as a surprise is the peak for the number of players flocking to their PC and Consoles wasn't on the day of launch for the game; instead, it was October 21, which is when everyone who pre-ordered it would be able to pre-load the game ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is also a huge game, as it's the first game to be available on Xbox Game Pass as a day-one release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone are also available to those who have Game Pass Ultimate. <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/10/black-ops-6-drives-biggest-ever-uk-gaming-traffic-on-ee-and-bt-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to ISPreview</a>, EE / BT saw a 144% increase in Xbox Live traffic on the broadband network compared to the week before. This is quite a monumental amount of traffic, but it isn't too surprising, as Call of Duty games are known for having huge download sizes. While there were reports that the game would be a whopping 300 GB, it isn't that big, thankfully. However, the game does still come in at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">sizable 102 GB</a> for pre-load,&nbsp; which, for a lot of people, will take a lot of time to install. Because of this, it makes perfect sense that the traffic for the game would increase so heavily on the pre-load day, as no one wants to be waiting around on release day trying to install a game at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any official figures released on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been performing since release, but it has only been a couple of days thus far. It will be interesting to see the metrics for the number of players who come from Game Pass, as it is a significantly cheaper way to access the game than paying for the title outright, something that isn't an option for many gamers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Passes in Fortnite To Progress Simultaneously by Earning XP, Coming December 1]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has taken off on a massive scale, and they are constantly adding new content to the game to keep it fresh and appealing for new and returning players. This includes adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/">new experiences</a> to the Fortnite universe, such as LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and a ton of User-Created Content (including Kamala Harris' new Fortnite experience.) This makes the game more accessible and easier to grind. All passes in Fortnite will progress simultaneously by earning XP from playing any experience. This <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive change</a> will be coming on December 1.</p>
<p>Currently, only the Battle Royale Battle Pass levels up from XP gained in any experience. However, the team will be rolling out the update to include the upcoming Music Pass, which was previously known as the Festival Pass. The Music Pass will be able to level up this way as of November 2, with the change affecting remaining passes and future passes as of December 1.</p>
<p>Much like the current Battle Pass, the Music and LEGO passes released after December 1 will instead change to having just one track, which includes both free and premium rewards. This helps simplify the battle passes significantly. Additionally, to further simplify the process, they are also retiring Festival Points on November 2, which will be followed by Battle Stars and Studs on December 1. This is to simplify the process of earning your passes, and the rewards will instead just be unlocked via earning XP.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to access the rewards in the Battle Pass, Music Pass, or LEGO Pass, you'll have to purchase them separately to get the premium rewards. However, you will still be able to access the free rewards with no issue.</p>
<p>Fortnite has gained a lot of popularity over the years, but it's now taking off in a somewhat peculiar way, too. In the final week before the U.S. 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris has been trying to pitch her campaign to gamers. To do this, they launched their Fortnite map, Freedom Town, USA. Exploring the city will show you some of Harris' campaign pledges to try and inspire young people to go out and vote. Those who want to see what has been created can check out the map using this code: 733155366547. It isn't all too surprising that Harris has decided to do this, as we've seen them join Twitch in recent days to talk about politics while playing games, with Tim Walz streaming with AOC and playing the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep an eye on your Battle Pass progress so that you aren't missing out on any rewards you may get as they slowly swap over to an XP progress system for all Battle Passes in Fortnite.</p>
