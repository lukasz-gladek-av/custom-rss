			<p>In a week, the second season of the Fallout show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will air on Amazon Prime Video</a>, and the main cast is currently busy with a series of interviews. Walton Goggins, the renowned actor behind what's arguably the most iconic character in the TV series, The Ghoul (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added to Fallout 76 as a quest-giving NPC</a>, voiced by Goggins), recently appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVH3ASR4cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Virgin Radio UK's 'Chris Evans Breakfast Show'</a> to reveal that creator Jonathan Nolan, the producers, the cast and the whole staff 'went for broke' instead of playing it safe with this second season.</p>



<p><em>I've been in this situation a few times where, if over the course of the first chapter of a show, if you will, if you're able to build a critical mass, what you have an opportunity to do in season two or chapter 2, is play it safe or go for broke and put everything in there. And that's what we did. We, meaning like, us in front of the camera, but really everybody behind the camera. There are 700 people employed by the Fallout show. It is a world.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, the actor showered Jonathan Nolan with praise for the scene in the first season's pilot when the bombs start dropping and his character, Cooper Howard, runs with his daughter for their lives.</p>



<p><em>It's based on one of the biggest video games in the world, right? Fallout. This game has been played for 20-some years by players all over the world, and there's a very unique attachment to this experience. When we set out to do this, Jonathan Nolan in cahoots with Todd Howard and Bethesda Games, the idea was to tell an original story within the canon of Fallout. So yeah, it picks up in the very first episode with the ending of the world really seen through my perspective. I didn't understand what a unique opportunity that was for me until I saw it on film. Even though I experienced it, you know, on the day, but seeing it, I didn't realize that it was going to affect me viscerally the way that it did. [...] The way that John Nolan architected those shots and the way that he chose to tell that story was terrifying.</em></p>



<p>The second season of the Fallout show will run for eight episodes, just like the first one. A new episode will be released each week, with the second one scheduled for Christmas Eve, the third for New Year's Eve, and the final one for February 4, 2026. The story picks up immediately in the aftermath of the previous season's finale, taking viewers on a journey through the Mojave wasteland to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without retconning the events seen in the game Fallout: New Vegas</a>). Deathclaws have been confirmed to appear this season, too.</p>



<p>New additions to the cast of the Fallout show include Macaulay Culkin, who plays a mysterious "crazy genius" character; Justin Theroux, who portrays Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas; Kumail Nanjiani, who stars as a high-ranking officer of the Brotherhood of Steel; and Amy Acker, who will play Cooper Howard's assistant during the flashbacks. The show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already confirmed for a third season, too</a>.</p>

			<p>Among the technical solutions Sony implemented in its PlayStation 5 to enable the system to reach maximum performance without issue is a liquid metal cooling solution, which helps keep temperatures down when the system is pushed to its limits.</p>



<p>This cooling solution, however, led to significant issues, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/">the liquid metal can leak and leave dry spots on critical components, resulting in various malfunctions.</a></strong> Although Sony made some changes for the PlayStation 5 Pro and some of the latest base console models, liquid metal cooling issues can still affect systems, potentially even all of them, according to a technician.</p>



<p>Over on X,<a href="https://x.com/Modyfikator89"><strong> modder and service technician modyfikatorcasper</strong></a> shared a new report on a PlayStation 5 Slim (CFI-2016) system with less than one and a half years of life, which has been impacted by liquid metal issues. In this case, however, the liquid metal leak wasn't caused by the system's position, but by application quality and degradation over time and temperature. As such, the service technician believes all PS5 systems will eventually require maintenance, regardless of the model and its position.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>While the claim that all PlayStation 5 models will eventually require maintenance is bold, it is undeniable that the liquid metal issues have affected a lot of systems. Earlier this year, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassels highlighted how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">these issues are becoming more widespread</a></strong>, with an increasing number of users reporting various malfunctions over the past few months.</p>



<p><span>As most <span>current reports of PlayStation 5 units malfunctioning due to liquid metal issues involve older systems, it will take some time to determine if the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-consoles-improved-liquid-metal-application-similar-to-ps5-pro-prevent-leak-better-cooling/" target="_blank"><strong>new liquid metal TIM layout</strong></a>&nbsp;of the newly released&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank"><strong>CFI-2100 model</strong></a>&nbsp;has been accompanied by improved</span> application to prevent degradation over time, as it should with leaking issues.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just surprised fans with the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch 2 platform</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, the game was already available to play on the Switch 2 for those who owned the Switch version, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated</a> in May 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-is-now-available-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in September 2022. However, this native version offers various technical enhancements.</p>



<p>The developer says that it takes 'full advantage' of the latest Nintendo console's hardware, including NVIDIA DLSS support:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing</li>



<li>Improved load times</li>



<li>Optimized performance</li>



<li>Joy-Con 2 mouse control support</li>



<li>Motion controls</li>



<li>Amiibo support</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the technical improvements, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is exactly the same as it was on the original Switch. Just like with that version, Nintendo users can enjoy three exclusive in-game items inspired by The Legend of Zelda franchise: the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Champion’s Tunic. New users can purchase the game for $59.99, while existing Switch users will be able to upgrade to the improved version for free.</p>

<p>Beyond that, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the same content as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it first released</a> on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on November 11, 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the original game's launch. </p>

<ul>
<li>Adventurer's Backpack</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Mail</li>

</ul>



<p>That's the extent of the additional content you can get on the Nintendo Switch 2 (or the Nintendo Switch, for that matter) in Skyrim Anniversary Edition, since the game does not support the Creation Club menu on Nintendo's consoles, unlike PlayStation and Xbox consoles and, of course, PC. </p>



<p>By the way, if you've been hoping to see Skyrim's successor pop up any time soon, Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that The Elder Scrolls VI is still 'a long way off', and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will launch after GTA VI</a> in any case (meaning in 2027 at the earliest). </p>
