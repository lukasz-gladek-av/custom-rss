			<p>According to Capcom leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412">Dusk Golem</a>, not only is <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-gen/">Resident Evil Requiem releasing on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Capcom has plans to port ever Resident Evil game it has made using its RE Engine to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In response to someone asking Dusk Golem about the ports, they clarify that they're not talking about every Resident Evil game having a Cloud version playable on Switch 2, but a proper native port. Nintendo Switch players will have to remain satisfied with Cloud versions, though, or upgrade to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</em>"</p>



<p>As this exchange happened before today's news about a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/"> Nintendo Direct being confirmed</a>, Dusk Golem continues to say that, "<em>There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well. There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least <a href="https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz">https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dusk Golem adds that they don't know when each of the games will arrive, or if it's a surefire conclusion that Resident Evil VII: Biohazard will show up at this week's Nintendo Direct, just that they "<em>have heard very reliably several times now they're all coming to Switch 2 sooner or later, &amp; that does include Requiem (so RE7, RE:2, RE:3, Village, RE:4, Requiem)</em>."</p>



<p>The current library of Resident Evil games on Nintendo platforms includes classic ports of RE 0, Resident Evil, RE 4, RE 5, RE Revelations, RE Revelations 2, and RE 6. RE VII: Biohazard, RE 2 Remake, RE 3 Remake, and RE Village are all only available through Cloud versions. </p>



<p>If we get an announcement for RE VII: Biohazard on Switch 2 this coming Friday, then it will be at least one game Dusk Golem is right about, meaning they could be right about the rest. We'll see what Friday has in store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Chief Rebel and Arc Games announced a slight delay to the early access launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fellowship</a>, the 'multiplayer online dungeon adventure game'. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-early-access-release-date-october-open-beta-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously set for October 9</a>, but it'll now be available on Steam starting on October 16.</p>



<p>In the video below, Community Director Hamish Bode explained: </p>



<p><em>We made the decision recently to push back that early access date just a week. It's not a huge change, and I know that we all want to get in and play the game as soon as possible, but hopefully we can hold out just one more week. There are a couple of big reasons why we decided to do that. One, it gives the team a bunch more opportunities to implement all of the polish that they want to do. We've been privately play testing the game as you know, and we've made some pretty giant changes to the game that we really want to make sure are completely nailed down before we open the floodgates of early access. But there is a really big elephant in the room and we've always made the promise that we'll be as transparent with you as we can absolutely be. And that week is absolutely stacked with games, right? You've got things like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 launching</a>. I know people are looking at Legion Remix as well. It's just kind of a smart decision for us to push a week and give Fellowship the best possibility of getting recognized and hopefully getting the attention that I think we all agree that it deserves.</em></p>

<p>The Fellowship Open Beta test will kick off on Steam on Thursday, September 18 and end on Tuesday, September 23. The servers will open and close at 10 AM Pacific Time. Supported regions include North America, Europe, and Asia. Players will be able to experience seven heroes, including two tanks, three DPS, and two healers. They can go on dungeon runs, both ranked and quick play, and take on challenging enemies to acquire epic loot. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo from February, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding and an engaging progression system with weapons, gems, talents, crafting, legendary items, and more. </p>



<p>The Open Beta will also introduce a new dungeon, Urrak Markets, and new gameplay features, such as cosmetic customization. There will also be new gear, new mounts, and visual element improvements, as well as improvements to previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. Lastly, it will be a chance for the development team to test the improvements made to multiplayer matchmaking before the early access release.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">Last month's additions</a> included games like Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, along with a brand-new release of Sword and the Sea, which launched into the service.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm that tracks videogame industry sales data and <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">market trends</a> has published its <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2025">Global Games Market Report for 2025</a>, which includes plenty of interesting trends and predictions from Newzoo, and also reveals that it'll be videogame consoles, not mobile, that leads the growth in this year's videogame market, thanks to a boost from the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>One of the major headlines in the report is that the videogame industry will reach $188.8 billion in revenue in 2025, a 3.4% growth compared to 2024. For the mobile portion of the market, it'll generate $103 billion this year, a 2.9% growth from last year, with mobile games still representing the biggest chunk of the industry's revenue at 55%.</p>



<p>Another interesting layer Newzoo points out is that videogame players will make up 60% of the world's population, with 3 billion players on mobile, 936 million on PC, and 645 million on consoles, making for a total of 3.58 billion players across all gaming platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>A chunk of those will, of course, be playing on Nintendo Switch 2, but even with consoles driving revenue this year, mobile players are still the dominating force when it comes to the worldwide videogame playing population.</p>



<p>Newzoo also includes predictions for what the industry will look like in the next three years, saying that by 2028, the total market revenue will grow to $206.5 billion, with consoles predicted to have the biggest growth, not just from new hardware, but new major game releases like the coming Grand Theft Auto VI launch. Between consoles, PC, and mobile, Newzoo predicts consoles will have the most revenue growth at 4.7%.</p>



<p>Newzoo's player predictions for 2028 have console players growing to 688 million, and PC players passing the 1 billion mark for the first time in the industry's history. However, mobile players will still grow the by the largest amount, and at a faster rate than PC and console player growth.</p>



<p>"<em>2025 shows a market that's maturing - but no stagnating</em>," Newzoo writes in its concluding thoughts. "<em>Growth is there, it's just harder won. The winners will be the ones who lean into timing, retention, and ecosystem strength, not just the raw pursuit of new players</em>."</p>
