			<p>Kingmakers, the third-person action time-travelling game that gives you a truck and an assault rifle against legions of medieval-era knights with nothing but swords and horses, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-the-medieval-based-third-person-action-game-that-pits-assault-rifles-against-swords-launches-in-early-access-this-october/">initially meant to release in early access on PC later this week,</a> on October 8, 2025. Now, that's no longer the case, and the game's release has been delayed with no new release date in sight.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1974144040942625003">In a long statement posted to the X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the game, developer Redemption Road Games confirmed it needs more time to polish the game, rather than "<em>cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier</em>." What will be coming soon, is a half-hour gameplay deep-dive digging into the gameplay, and updating players on what the team has been working on. </p>



<p>"<em>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch on October 8 will no longer be possible</em>," the studio confirmed at the top of its statement. "<em>We want to apologize to all the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier.</em> <em>Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity</em>.</p>



<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently</em> <em>have tens of thousands of soldiers,</em> <em>each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena...</em></p>



<p><em>...We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kingmakers is one of the few indie games that, when it first gets announced, <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">has a viral moment and is suddenly in front of millions of eyes</a>. It has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">over a million wishlists on Steam</a> thanks to that first burst of virality, but hype fades as easily as it builds.</p>



<p>Whenever Kingmakers does release, we'll see if it is any deeper than the viral mix of driving a truck through hundreds of knights that can't do anything about it. Perhaps the coming gameplay deep-dive will begin to do away with those concerns, and of course, with it being an early access title, there will likely be plenty of time for it to develop and get better based on community feedback.</p>

			<p>The latest first-party PlayStation exclusive game, Ghost of Yōtei, is off to a strong start, at least in the United Kingdom. Former GI.biz editor-in-chief Chris Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1974886331445903775?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X</a> that Sucker Punch's latest game managed to reach number 1 in the weekly UK physical sales chart, beating EA Sports FC 26's second week on the market, a massive feat considering how popular the football game is in the country. Dring then clarified that there was a 40% drop compared to the predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, but this should be put in perspective.</p>



<p>First of all, Ghost of Tsushima dropped in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, when practically everyone was stuck at home playing games. Moreover, it came at the very end of the PlayStation 4 lifecycle, only a few months ahead of the PS5 launch. This also means that Tsushima could count on a PS4 global install base about 20 million units larger than PS5's base now that Ghost of Yōtei has launched. Lastly, digital sales have slowly but surely gained ground on physical sales with every passing year, so we'll only know the full picture once digital sales data is also available.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I explained in my review of the open world action/adventure game</a>, Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to Tsushima in practically everything that matters. Those who loved the studio's previous entry will no doubt enjoy the new title as well.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch Production hasn't shared any info about a potential DLC, although we only learned about Iki Island, the only Ghost of Tsushima DLC, much later than the base game's debut. We do, however, already know that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends co-op multiplayer mode will debut at some point in 2026</a>. The studio hasn't discussed the PC port yet, but it would make sense for Legends and the PC version to launch at the same time with cross-play enabled.</p>
