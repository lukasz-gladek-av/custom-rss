			<p>As the release date for Assassin's Creed Shadows looms ever closer, Ubisoft has begun to drop details about the upcoming title, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-mx/game/assassins-creed/news/1lmnk4XTnnqRh1foViGYPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new post</a> detailing the Stealth gameplay that players can expect from diving into this title. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on February 14, 2025, after Ubisoft announced that they will be delaying the game from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">original release date of November 15, 2024</a>. However, in September, Ubisoft announced that although the game's features are padded out how they wanted, they are going to delay the release to polish the game further <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">after Star Wars Outlaws suffered from a poor release</a> in August.</p>
<p>The stealth gameplay overview focuses primarily on Naoe, one of the two protagonists available in the game. One of the main features in the stealth gameplay is the Observe mechanic, which both Naoe and Yasuke have access to. This allows you to identify targets as well as tagging and monitoring enemies. This feature was available in previous games but wasn't as detailed. "The new Observer mechanic is at the core of the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience. When in doubt, take a pause, observe the world around you, and only then should you decide what your next move should be," says Simon Lemay-Comtois, Associate Game Director.</p>
<p>The blog post showcases many different features of how stealth works in Assassin's Creed Shadows, with small clips that showcase each element.</p>
<p>Naoe doesn't just have to rely on movement and being stealthy to get out of situations, as she has four tools that she can use to help her get away from a sticky situation or to secure a kill on a target. This includes Smoke Bombs, Shinobi Bells, Kunai, and Shuriken. All of them relate to the stealth mechanic in some way. For example, Shinobi Bells create noise, and you can throw them somewhere to alert enemies to the bell rather than to your presence. Kunai can be used for one-shot kills if you are good with your aim. Shuriken can stun enemies and cause distractions if thrown into an environment. The Smoke bombs are self explanatory, and the blog post provides a glimpse into the action of how Naoe can use these tools to better the situation.</p>
<p>"Naoe is our smallest Assassin to date. And she uses that to her advantage: she can squeeze through tiny wall cracks, and she can hide inside small storage spaces and boxes in order to get the drop on her enemies," says Lemay-Comtois.</p>
<p>When it comes to stealth, this is primarily an option that is given to Naoe, although Yasuke does have a couple of options if you want to avoid direct combat. Overall, it seems that the stealth system in Assassin's Creed Shadows has been well thought out, with tools to use at your disposal as well as a progression system that can allow you to tunnel vision skills for your stealth or abilities.</p>

			<p>Marvel Games and NetEase Games have made the announcement that Hawkeye will be joining the launch roster for Marvel Rivals. So far, the roster is pretty nicely stacked and has a lot of variation for those who plan on getting stuck into the game. The release date for Marvel Rivals isn't far away, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-demanding-540p-xbox-series-s/">the game will be launching on December 6</a> with all heroes unlocked and free to play. In addition to Hawkeye's reveal, the dev team has also revealed a new map being added for Wakanda. The map is called Birnin T'Challa and is a built-up, futuristic city in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hawkeye: The Unmatched Sharpshooter | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmZ8wuXNG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate all of the announcements they've made, they've released a trailer for Hawkeye and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Ci9jZY11JluGVcqL&amp;v=dz_778SYulo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Birnin T'Challa</a>, respectively, as well as a new dev diary that was released five days ago to talk about some of the decisions they've made for the upcoming hero shooter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYSZFAZC3Kg&amp;t=22s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The dev diary</a> talks about the roadmap of the upcoming game, with the title beginning with Season 0, named "Doom's Rise." This season will be month-long, where players will get to experiment with 33 heroes and eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes. There will also be a Conquest map and a new Practice Range, allowing players to experiment with the superheroes before taking them into a game against other people. The Doom's Rise season is all about the chaos that is caused by Doctor Doom and his time experiments, which is also explained in the dev diary released recently.</p>
<p>Since Season 0 is so short, there will be a battle pass available, but it will have half the content of a full Seasonal Battle Pass, with the battle pass being priced accordingly for the month long season. Additionally, there is an in-game store that will have regular rotations with costumes and cosmetics inspired by the comics, MCU, and costumes that are specifically created to reflect the storyline of Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>These costumes include the Imperial Protocol series, which has Afrofuturism roots and is representative of the empire of Wakanda. As Hawkeye is the latest character to be added to the ever-expanding roster of Marvel Rivals, he is the fourth in the story set to receive an Imperial Protocol costume, with details of the cosmetic set to be revealed sometime soon.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals?</p>
