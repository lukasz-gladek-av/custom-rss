			<p><span>The new PlayStation 5 Pro CFI-7121 model, no</span>w available across Europe, comes with some improvements over the original model, a new teardown conducted by&nbsp;Austin Evans&nbsp;confirmed.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between the PlayStation 5 Pro launch model and the CFI-7121 model is better power efficiency for the 2025 model. In tests conducted running Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, the CFI-7121 model proved to be 2 to 3% more power efficient, even running replays in Gran Turismo 7 which push the system the most with full ray tracing support. Thanks to the better power efficiency, the new system also runs slightly cooler than 2024's launch model.</p>



<p>The CFI-7121 model is also noticeably quieter. In the tests, the new unit proved to be 20% quieter than the launch model, representing a 2-decibel difference. The new fan's slightly lower-pitched sound profile further enhances this reduction.</p>



<p>The differences between the two PlayStation 5 Pro models are minimal for the rest. Changes like slightly different fan from another manufacturer, a plastic fan grid in place of a metal grid, a lighter rear heat sink, the removal of some VMMs from the motherboard and a lighter, possibly more efficient power supply, result not only in the enhanced power efficiency, but also in a lighter weight - 3016 grams against the 3103 grams of the launch model.</p>



<p>The changes for the new DualSense controller revision are even smaller. Aside from some small internal changes and parts produced by a different manufacturer than those in a launch controller, the new DualSense only saw the removal of the back microphone. This is a rather small change likely made to keep manufacturing costs down without significantly impacting the controller's performance and functionality.</p>



<p>You can see the full breakdown of these hardware changes, including the fan and heatsink revisions, in Austin Evans' complete teardown video below.</p>

<p>While it was expected that the new PlayStation 5 Pro model would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">around 3% more power efficient than the launch model</a>, the new DualSense V3 controller revision is minimal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">which is not what earlier reports suggested earlier this month</a>. While this may be disappointing for some, the fact that the changes made to the controller don't impact its functionality and keep its price down should still be welcome amidst consistent price increases that have made both<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"> the regular PlayStation 5 </a>and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/"> Xbox Series X|S systems more expensive</a> since their launch in 2020.</p>

			<p>Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the Bloodborne PC Remaster project, is fixing one of the PlayStation 4 release's most significant graphical shortcomings, making the emulated version of the game the definitive way to experience the FromSoftware action RPG.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, the project's developer confirmed they have figured out how to replace the low quality distant meshes that Bloodborne uses frequently to optimize performance on PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>At 1080p resolution and with the vanilla game's depth of field, these low-quality meshes are hardly noticeable, but at higher resolution on PC, they definitely are. As even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">low-end machines have no trouble running the game with solid performance</a>, there's no need for these low-quality meshes anymore, which are being replaced with the full-fat version of the model. Judging from the video, the results promise to be stunning, enhancing the haunting beauty of Yarnham's central locations considerably with enhanced detail.</p>

<p>When these improvements will be added to the Bloodborne PC Remaster project has yet to be determined. However, those who wish to experience the game developed by FromSoftware with a slew of visual improvements can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">download the project's current version from Nexus Mods. </a></p>



<p>The latest version of the project, version 0.93, was released on October 14 to restore baked lighting for better visuals while retaining some of the project's best improvements, including dynamic shadows. For a game relying so much on its eerie atmosphere, these additions vastly improve the Bloodborne PC experience made possible by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amid the busy halls of the Makuhari Messe during this year’s Tokyo Game Show, we were able to carve out a brief fifteen minutes to talk with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi as Square-Enix was showing off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S|X releases of the first title in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>. With questions being handled through an interpreter, we might not have gotten time to answer everything we wanted to know about the upcoming releases, but we were able to touch on some of the bigger questions on our readers’ minds.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>In a <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt">recent interview</a>, you talked about how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be on a Game Key Card rather than a physical cartridge. Do you see Nintendo ever increasing the speeds on these Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges so that this would not be a requirement in the future?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2. I’m not with Nintendo, so I can’t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges. Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers. Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side.</p>



<p>I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.</p>



<p><strong>These new versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake have several accessibility options, like Easy mode or infinite health, available through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-dev-streamlined-progression-players-should-have-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlined Progression feature</a>. Are these in reaction to the original release's too-difficult reception?</strong></p>



<p>Those features are not really about balancing the game. We’re actually quite confident about that because we did fine-tuning until the very end of development, so I think the balance itself is very good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why we wanted to implement those features is to address the way modern audiences play video games being so diversified these days. Originally, with console video games, people would play on their TV in the living room, then we saw more players playing in their bedroom or on a PC. Now, we also see more players on handheld devices outdoors. In general, the way people approach and play video games is just so diverse, so we wanted to bring an idea that reflects that. It’s not just the way you play games in general, but we wanted to bring a diversified way to play <em>our</em> games, which is why we implemented those features.</p>



<p><strong>Would you ever consider developing a mobile version of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, we do want to bring our games to a wider audience. When we look at the market landscape of the mobile side, particularly iPhone and Android users, we don’t really feel that there’s quite the demand to justify us creating a mobile port of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. If there is a demand, we would definitely want to look forward to hearing that.</p>



<p>As of this moment, I don’t think the demand is quite there yet from a business perspective. We will continue to look at the market trends and if there is the right opportunity at the right moment, that’s when we will revisit this topic.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for a DLC to bridge the gap between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the third title in the Remake project, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade?</strong></p>



<p>There were definitely some ideas to create a Rebirth DLC and that was the plan at a certain point in time, but when we revisited this topic and we thought about what our priorities should be and what the fans are looking forward to the most. We figured that what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible. That would take priority over the Rebirth DLC, so we decided to take that approach.</p>



<p>With that being said, once we release the third installment, there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment. With the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole.&nbsp;Whether we bring another new DLC or a full title, that’s something we are actively considering.</p>



<p><strong>If enough fans ask for it, would you consider a standalone Queen’s Blood game to be a priority?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my previous response, the utmost importance right now is to work hard towards that third installment and make sure it gets released as soon as possible with the highest quality achievable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the solo Queen’s Blood title is probably not in the list of our priorities. We actually haven’t determined any priorities after the release of the third installment, so things are really up in the air right now. If there is enough demand, a solo Queen’s Blood title is definitely something we can consider.</p>



<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a massive soundtrack. My last question to you: is there one specific song that you’ve had on repeat or listened to the most out of the whole soundtrack?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there’s the staples like the Final Fantasy main theme that we’ve heard over and over, but for me personally, I do like the Stamp song Bow Wow Wow (Chuken Stamp).</p>



<p><strong>It’s very catchy.</strong></p>



<p>I hope a lot of people like that track too.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>
