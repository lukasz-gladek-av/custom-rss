			<p>FromSoftware's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> was a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">standout reveal</strong> during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event</strong></a>, though its continued absence from the spotlight has led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">speculation regarding its launch timeline</strong>. Despite the title not appearing during this month's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, the project <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains on track to release before the end of the year.</strong></p>



<p>Kadokawa, FromSoftware's parent company, reiterated this window today in its <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Q3 fiscal year earnings report</strong></a>, confirming a generic <strong>2026</strong> schedule for the title.</p>



<p> In the report, Kadokawa also addressed the game's platform status, stating it will<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2".</em> While this confirms exclusivity for now, it likely refers to the game’s status at launch. Given the broader industry trend of moving away from permanent console exclusives, it would be <strong>a significant shift</strong> if <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> did not eventually see a PC release, at the very least.</p>



<p>The high level of anticipation surrounding <em>The Duskbloods</em> is understandable, especially following how <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em></strong> evolved the studio's formula with its roguelike-meets-soulslike co-op mechanics in 2025.</p>



<p>Reports suggest that <em>The Duskbloods</em> will take things a step further. The game has been in development since before <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>'s marketing began, making it <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">one of the studio's longest development cycles</a></strong> to date, and focuses on innovative gameplay features the studio is reportedly very proud of. As such, players are eager to see the game and these systems in action. Hopefully, it will be soon.</p>

			<p>After a bombastic launch that saw <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> become the best-selling shooter of 2025 and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game in the US overall</a></strong> in 2025, enthusiasm waned around <strong>EA's</strong> successful <strong>Call of Duty-killer</strong> as the assembled team of developers known as <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> was unable to keep up with players' thirst for new content.</p>



<p>It went from a game that had a chance of cracking 1 million concurrent players on Steam alone to one that has been struggling to hit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">100K concurrent players</a>. Thankfully, though, after an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">unwelcome delay</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios may finally start to have better luck, as <strong>Season 2</strong> for Battlefield 6 is finally just days away, and EA has officially revealed what's coming in this new season.</p>



<p>Ahead of the official reveal, I got the chance to check out a short presentation detailing what's coming in Season 2, as well as the chance to spend some time with the new content. For now, I can't talk about my thoughts on Season 2 and the new content, and you'll be able to read those in the coming days. If you want a peek at what that might sound like, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">you can check out my preview of Season 1</a> or my review of Battlefield 6 to find out more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">my thoughts on the game</a>. In the meantime, here are all of the details for what's coming in Season 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-breakdown">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Breakdown</h2>

<h3 id="h-leadoff-extreme-measures">Leadoff - Extreme Measures</h3>



<p>Like its initial season, Season 2 will be broken into three phases. This time, they're called <strong>Extreme Measures, Nightfall, </strong>and <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>. Extreme Measures kicks off Season 2, and it's easily the most jam-packed phase of the three. It adds a new map, new weapons, new gadgets, and new vehicles, including the fan-favourite <strong>AH-6 Little Bird</strong> helicopter.</p>



<p>Extreme Measures launches with the arrival of Season 2 and lasts from <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, to <strong>March 17, 2026,</strong> and brings with it a new feature that players are desperate for: a new map. The new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map launches with Extreme Measures, which brings players to Germany's more mountainous corners, with rocky terrain surrounding a German airbase.</p>



<p>Along with the new map, the other major feature arriving in Extreme Measures is a new limited-time mode, <strong>VL-7 Strike.</strong> This mode covers the map with a hallucinogenic smoke that will have you unable to see what's in front of you, while also seeing and hearing things that aren't really there. You can wear a gas mask to keep yourself from hallucinating, but that doesn't fix how thick the gas is in the first place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons getting introduced in Extreme Measures, players will get their hands on three new weapons. A new assault rifle, the <strong>VC-2</strong>. It's a rifle that thrives in close-quarters engagements, and it's capable of burning through enemies. The <strong>M121 A2</strong> is a new belt-fed light machine gun joining the arsenal, and lastly, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a new semi-automatic DMR.</p>



<p>Engineers are getting a new guided missile launcher gadget, the <strong>9K38 IGLA,</strong> while Recon players will be getting the <strong>HTI-Mk2,</strong> a device that can detect enemy gadgets, suppress enemy recon drones, and disrupt enemy rockets. The only vehicle added to the game in Extreme Measures is the aforementioned Little Bird helicopter.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-nightfall">What's on Deck - Nightfall</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Picking up right where Extreme Measures leaves off, <strong>Nightfall</strong> starts on <strong>March 17, 2026, </strong>and runs until <strong>April 14, 2026</strong>. It'll add the second and last map included in Battlefield 6's second season, <strong>Hagental Base</strong>, and introduce a new limited-time mode, also called Nightfall.</p>



<p>Hagental Base is already a dimly lit place, and there will be plenty of chances for you to use the darkness to your advantage. The map's lighting gets remixed and, almost entirely turned off in the Nightfall LTM, where you're battling against enemy squads in pitch black corridors, as the map is limited to the facility within the mountain range.</p>



<p>All players will have the option of bringing Night Vision Goggles with them in their loadout, but your choice between using NVGs or just a flashlight, which could very well blind an unaware NVG-user, could be the difference between winning or losing a fight. The Nightfall LTM will also be available in REDSEC as a mode in Gauntlet, outside of the vanilla multiplayer.</p>



<p>Two new weapons will be added in Nightfall (the phase), the <strong>CZ3A1</strong> submachine gun, and the <strong>VC.61</strong> fully-automatic sidearm. Both have a high fire rate, making them ideal for close encounters, like the kind you might not see coming until the last second, because you can't see what's in front of you.</p>



<p>Nightfall also introduces a new vehicle, the <strong>M1030 Dirt Bike</strong>. You and a squadmate can jump on the back of the bike and cut across a map even faster than before, trying to hit a sick jump and a sick shot at the same time.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-hunter-prey">In the Hole - Hunter/Prey</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-6-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The last phase of Season 2, <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>, kicks off on <strong>April 14, 2026, </strong>and is the thinnest phase in terms of content. Or, that's how it seems at the moment, that is. During the presentation, EA did clarify that there is more to the phase than what they've shown so far, as there's currently no indication that Hunter/Prey adds a new map.</p>



<p>Season 1 did add three maps altogether, so maybe there's a third waiting in the wings. What we do know is that coming in Hunter/Prey is another limited-time mode, <strong>Operation Augur.</strong> It's a new mode directly inspired by the Operations introduced in <strong>Battlefield 1,</strong> and it features both of Season 2's new maps, Hagental Base and Contaminated.</p>



<p>It begins on Contaminated, with the attackers driving an assault while using VL-7 gas to push the defenders into Hagental Base, where the battle concludes in infantry-based warfare. Hunter/Prey also adds a new <strong>LTV</strong> vehicle, a new 14" <strong>Ripper</strong> machete melee weapon, and a new unnamed weapon, though that's about all we know at the moment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Hits 14M Copies Sold, Drove “Record-High Q4 and Full-Year Revenue” for Nexon with 25% YoY Increase]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/</link>
            <guid>1433623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nexon</strong> has just reported its<a href="https://www.nexon.co.jp/en/ir/"> fourth-quarter 2025 financials,</a> and, unsurprisingly, the company recorded "<em>record-high Q4 and full-year revenue</em>." The thing that makes it no surprise is the fact that Nexon is the parent company of <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the team behind the hottest new extraction shooter, <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>. Which we now know has officially sold <strong>14 million copies</strong> since it launched in October 2025.</p>



<p>This official sales update comes after a recent report that ARC Raiders was the top-selling game across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">a third consecutive month</a></strong>. It also means that the game sold just under <strong>2M</strong> copies in the last month, since Embark confirmed the game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold 12.4 million copies in January</a>.</p>



<p>The success of ARC Raiders helped drive a <strong>25% year-on-year (YoY)</strong> revenue increase for Nexon, with the company's overall revenue reaching <strong>$3.1 billion.</strong> Though Embark's popular shooter isn't the only story behind the company's record revenues (though, admittedly, it is most of the story).</p>



<p>It's the <strong>MapleStory</strong> franchise that drove growth outside of ARC Raiders, with the new release of <strong>MapleStory: Idle RPG</strong> driving growth after remaining the number one game on app stores for more than <strong>10 weeks.</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nexon-Q42025-Financial-Report.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Nexon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Embark Studios' other shooter, <strong>The Finals</strong>, wasn't a slouch while the new third-person extraction shooter took most of the glory. Revenue from The Finals also grew compared to the last fiscal year, with a significant chunk of that growth coming in December thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/"><strong>Season 9</strong> update.</a></p>



<p>Looking ahead, Nexon lists eight games in development, half of them being new IPs, while the rest are new games in the <strong>Dungeons and Fighters</strong>, the <strong>Mabinogi: Heroes</strong>, and <strong>Durango</strong> franchises. </p>



<ul>
<li>Azur Promilia - new IP published by Nexon - fantasy world RPG</li>



<li>Project DX - new Durango-based game developed/published by Nexon - MMORPG</li>



<li>Project RX - new IP developed/published by Nexon - anime-style game</li>



<li>Vindictus: Defying Fate - new Mabinogi: Heroes-based game developed/published by Nexon - action RPG</li>



<li>Nakwon: Last Paradise - new IP developed/published by Nexon - extraction survival game</li>



<li>Woochi: The Wayfarer - new IP developed/published by Nexon - action adventure</li>



<li>Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - open-world action RPG</li>



<li>Project Overkill - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - 3D action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>The rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-starcraft-shooter-blizzard-entertainment/">StarCraft</a></strong> game said to be in development at Nexon is not mentioned, though that's not exactly a surprise since whatever is happening with StarCraft likely won't be revealed until BlizzCon 2026. And if it was spoiled in a financial report, that would be more than a little anticlimactic.</p>
