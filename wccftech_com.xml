            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the new sci-fi intellectual property in development at Naughty Dog, won't be released before 2027. The comment was prompted by CD Projekt RED's confirmation to investors that The Witcher IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn't launch before the end of 2026</a>.</p>
<p>On the ResetEra forum, users recalled that Schreier had talked about both games (which were shown for the first time at The Game Awards 2024 in December) as being quite early in the development phase and relatively far from launch. Schreier himself then chimed in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/post-137487981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new post</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm pretty sure I said they were both going to be very early teases. Neither of those games will be out next year.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, while we didn't have any dates for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Game Director Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that fans would have to wait quite some time:</p>
<p><em>We still have a ways to go, but I'm kind of very excited to see... Again, these things are so complex and big and there's so many people involved. It's like, I still don't know exactly what this thing's gonna look like at the end. It's like, I have a theory, I have an idea, but it's still evolving and changing as we are making it.</em></p>
<p>If Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet launched in 2027, it would be seven years since the launch of Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us Part II. That's a very long time between releases, but it should be noted that Naughty Dog had nearly completed The Last of Us Online before deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancel it</a> after they realized (with Bungie's input) that the game's post-launch support would have absorbed much of the studio's efforts for years to come. It is quite likely that if The Last of Us Online was not canceled, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would have been postponed even further away.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Witcher IV will also be the studio's next full game release after Cyberpunk 2077's late 2020 debut. CD Projekt RED did not cancel a game in between, but they were busy improving Cyberpunk 2077 and releasing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Moreover, the studio has transitioned from its in-house RED Engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say there are reasons why these games are taking so long. Nonetheless, it's becoming apparent that the largest triple-A games can now take between five and seven years to complete, which makes it all the more challenging to invest in them, as failure would be catastrophic to a studio after spending so much time and resources.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-uncapped-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-cap-can-be-removed-with-new-version-of-special-k-mod-1-0-1-patch-released-to-address-%E2%80%9Cvarious%E2%80%9D-issues.1145085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-uncapped-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new version of the popular Special K mod improves Assassin's Creed Shadows on PC by fixing multiple issues and introducing an option to uncap cutscenes' framerate.</p>
<p>Shortly after the release of the latest entry in the series, Special K creator Kaldaien released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3159330/discussions/0/612032512885050246/">a new version of the mod</a>, which includes an option to uncap cutscenes framerate and addresses several issues found in the PC version of the game, which includes NVIDIA DLSS options mysteriously becoming unavailable and broken NVIDIA Reflex integration.</p>
<p>The new version of the Special K mod introducing the fixes highlighted above is also fully compatible with the Assassin's Creed Shadows latest patch, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1jjlifk/ac_shadows_title_update_101_hot_fix_release_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch 1.0.1</a>, which was released today. Unfortunately, the patch doesn't bring any major changes to the game, as it only fixes some unspecified global issues and a Photo mode issue that could cause a crash when fetching photos to display on the game's world map.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is far from being among the best open-world role-playing games released to date, but it's still a solid entry in the Ubisoft series, bringing back a focus on stealth gameplay without doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-monster-hunter-wilds-bug-is-sweet-revenge-for-those-stuck-at-30-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has some<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"> widely reported technical issues</a> that impact the game's performance considerably, but you should consider yourself lucky if you cannot run the game at a high framerate thanks to a bug that actually increases damage dealt by multi-hit attacks the lower the framerate is.</p>
<p>A video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Antawoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Anta</a> a few days ago showcases how multi-hit moves in the latest entry in the series actually deal more damage under certain conditions when the game runs at 30 FPS, the lower possible framerate cap available on PC. This is caused by framerate tied to game logic, which isn't something new for the series, as Monster Hunter Rise, for example, was also affected by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-challenging-high-framerates/">a similar issue</a> that made the game harder when running at higher than 30 FPS, which really seems to be the ideal framerate for the series' developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Monster Hunter Wilds] This bug is stealing your damage - Here's how to fix it" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB3e1zYpuqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After watching the video above, I launched Monster Hunter Wilds and did a quick test using a Great Sword and the Training Area dummy, which confirmed the bug described by Anta occurs very frequently. The Total Damage seen in the screenshot below was dealt with the game running with a 30 FPS cap, while the Previous Total with a 120 FPS cap. While there are ways to mitigate the issue, as highlighted in the video, they are far from ideal, so hopefully, the issue will be addressed with a future update.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first major update will launch next week on all formats, introducing new features to the game as well as High Rank Zoh Shia and returning monster Mizustune.

			<p>It looks like Microsoft's big decision to switch to a multiplatform policy could start paying dividends soon if the PlayStation Store pre-order charts are to be believed. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-topping-the-pre-order-charts-on-the-playstation-store-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-forza-horizon-5.1144932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX, two games that are due to launch in April, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5, are taking the top spots across various countries with their various editions.</p>
<p><em><strong>United States</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #14</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #5, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #17</em></p>
<p><em><strong>France</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #3, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #2, #11</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Italy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #3</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #5, #22</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #2, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #3, #13</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Portugal</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #3, #11</em></p>
<p>It seems like PlayStation users are eager to get their hands on two of the best Microsoft games released in the past few years. Forza Horizon 5 might be the most surprising since it's now nearly four years old. Still, it's arguably the finest open world racing game ever made, having won several Game of the Year awards in 2021. Here on Wccftech, the game earned a 9.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wray's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let's keep it simple. Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game. It's outstanding, and I can unashamedly say that if it's not my favorite, it's in my top five games of the year. I recommend it for anybody and everybody.</em></p>
<p>When the game launches on PS5 on April 29, all users in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40-million-strong community</a> will be able to access the new Horizon Realms update that allows drivers to relive the post-launch Evolving World updates at their leisure.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will debut twelve days earlier despite being much more recent. Still, it's just every bit as great as Forza Horizon 5 in its own genre, as I outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 9/10 review of the PC version</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>It is perhaps a bit ironic that both games will be played best on consoles on Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, but that's entirely on Microsoft for choosing not to make another mid-generation console refresh like they did with the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>Anyway, as The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-more-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a>, this is just the beginning for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch users. Microsoft-owned studios are expected to release many more titles on 'rival' consoles throughout the year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly Bethesda's Starfield</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian's Avowed</a>, and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-change-seasons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%93-how-to-change-seasons.1145013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-change-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows enhances the open-world formula seen in previous entries in the series by introducing some dynamic elements that make the world feel more alive than ever. Some of these elements also have a considerable impact on the gameplay, such as Seasons. Depending on the current one, Naoe and Yasuke will have to deal with different weather and environmental conditions that can make certain quests easier or harder to complete. Other mechanics, such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/"> Scouts mechanics</a>, are also tied to the cycle of Seasons, so knowing how they change is extremely important to take full advantage of all the mechanics tied to them.</p>
<p>The changing of Seasons in Assassin's Creed Shadows depends on the<strong> actual passage of time</strong>. <strong>Spring, Summer and Autumn last 140 minutes</strong>, while <strong>Winter 180 minutes</strong>. No matter which activity you complete in the game, <strong>there's no way to speed up the changing of Seasons</strong>, altough there are ways to prevent a Season from changing automatically, or initiate a change manually when the time is up.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250326114317_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To learn when a Season will end, all you need to do is open the main menu and access the World tab. In the upper right corner of the map, you will find<strong> a compass</strong> with a circulation progression bar. Once it is filled with the passage of time, <strong>the Season will change if you either fast travel, complete a mission or hold the right directional button while in the World menu</strong>. The same will happen if you do any of the things above when the progression bar is halfway full. In this case, you will trigger a mid-season refresh that won't change the Season, but will refresh locations, local factions and alerts.</p>
<p>Even if the Season has ended, if you do not fast travel, complete a mission or trigger the change manually via the main menu, <strong>it will not change</strong>, so you can use this to your advantage. During Spring, for example, you will find additional vegetation all over the world, which you can use to better conceal yourself if needed. During Fall, to make another example, weather will change more often, and you can use a heavy downpour at night to have an easier time sneaking inside enemy strongholds or camps. Being able to change the Season at wish might have been better for some, but this new Assassin's Creed Shadows system, if used correctly, can still be a strong tool to help Naoe and Yasuke in their quest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning reveal trailer</a> for The Witcher IV at The Game Awards 2024, fans might have hoped to see the game in the not-too-distant future. However, CD Projekt RED has now confirmed that there's still a long wait ahead.</p>
<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4?t=1175s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal year 2024 earnings conference</a>, they announced that the game won't be launched until at least 2027. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>Regarding the expected release date for The Witcher IV, we are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet. All we could share for now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the timeframe of the first target for the incentive program, which ends on 31 December 2026.</em></p>
<p>It isn't inconceivable, then, that the two most anticipated fantasy open world roleplaying games, The Elder Scrolls VI and The Witcher IV, might be launched in the same year or at least in relative proximity. Bethesda's game might also debut in late 2027, given that Starfield <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in September 2023</a>, and there is usually a four-year timeframe between their titles.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned reveal of The Witcher IV, the Polish studio provided some info on the first installment in the new saga:</p>
<ul>
<li>As most fans had surmised following the end of the previous chapter, Cirilla Fiona Riannon will be the protagonist. The previous actress (Jo Wyatt) has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ciara Berkeley. Having Ciri leading the game also allows the development team to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase player agency</a> since she's just starting her journey as a Witcher, as opposed to Geralt, who had a lot of experience on the job.</li>
<li>There will be 'super compelling, very meaningful' <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-has-super-compelling-very-meaningful-romances-in-store-for-ciri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romances</a> in store for her throughout the game.</li>
<li>Gwent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the game</a>.</li>
<li>The Witcher IV will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the same size as The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</a>, although the team aims for quality rather than quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial report, CD Projekt RED revealed that 2024 was a solid year despite the lack of new releases. The studio almost reached $260 million in revenue, and the net profit line was the third-best in the group's history. CD Projekt RED also announced that it will soon become the owner of 100% of shares of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Molasses Flood</a>, the Boston-based developer that's working on The Witcher spin-off called Project Sirius. As you might remember, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> a couple of years ago. Following the total control of the shares, The Molasses Flood will be fully merged into CD Projekt RED.</p>
