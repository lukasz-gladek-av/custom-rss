			<p><strong>Ubisoft's</strong> recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> continues to ripple through the video game industry, and now it has led to what was arguably an inevitable point in this story, as French unions representing Ubisoft workers, namely <strong>Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du jeu Vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT</strong>, and <strong>Printemps écologique</strong>, have called for a <strong>strike</strong> in response to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">recent layoffs, studio closures, and the proposed end to remote work policies under a return-to-office mandate</a>. </p>



<p>The strike called by the French unions will be a three-day event, taking place on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12,</strong> with the unions calling for all Ubisoft workers worldwide to join them in the demonstration. It's also not the only demonstration planned, as the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mdggnk5yos26">set to hold a rally in Halifax this coming <strong>Thursday, January 29, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> in solidarity with the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">who were laid off when Ubisoft shut down its Halifax studio earlier this month</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Enough is enough!</em>" begins a collaborative statement from the STJV and the aforementioned French unions. "<em>Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn't even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th, and 12th</em>."</p>







<p>The statement shared goes on to further call out Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, claiming that he and Ubisoft management are going back on a remote work policy deal that was in place since <strong>September 2025</strong>, and further calls out the company's top brass for not taking responsibility for their actions that have led to this major restructure. A fair point to make, since you might recall that Guillemot and the current Ubisoft leadership led the company to lose <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">95% of its total value in the last eight years</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"<em>We are told about responsibilities,</em> <em>but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management, the latest result being the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">elimination of 200 jobs at Ubisoft's headquarters</a></em>."</p>



<p>Prior to this strike call, earlier this week, French union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">directly called out Guillemot for having "<em>no knowledge or understanding of his company</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ubisoft's "<em>major reset</em>" reorganized the company into five Creative Houses, with its various branching studios across the world put into at least one of the five houses, if they survived the restructure. Ubisoft claims the Halifax and Stockholm studio shutdowns were part of this restructure, as were layoffs announced last year at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>. We also know that the restructure is responsible for pushing out senior veteran talent at Ubisoft, with the company losing its lead on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Assassin's Creed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">The Division</a></strong>. The former is <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">even suing Ubisoft for "<em>constructive dismissal</em>."</a></p>



<p>The reset also saw six projects get cancelled, including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> and seven more delayed, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>. In all of this mess, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/"><strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> survived</a>, and is still in production, according to Ubisoft.</p>



<p>It's still early days as to how the dust will settle with this restructure. While French unions put pressure on Ubisoft in the company's home country, the CWA Canada <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">continues to apply pressure to the Nova Scotia government and the Canadian public to carefully scrutinize the closure of the Halifax studio,</a> pressure that has already resulted in Ubisoft reconsidering the severance package it would offer workers. The union has also <a href="https://ubisoftworkerscanada.com/">kicked off a letter-writing campaign and published a timeline outlining why it believes the closure to be suspect</a>, as the Nova Scotia Labour Board investigates.</p>

			<p>Japanese developer and publisher <strong>CAPCOM</strong> has enjoyed a strong stock run today, closing <strong>up 9,82%</strong> over yesterday. Investors were pleased with <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company's third-quarter financial report</a>, which showed a 30% increase in net sales, a 75% increase in operating profit, and a 65% increase in ordinary profit. The current fiscal year's net sales after Q3 are $753 million, with $355 million in operating profit and $338 million in ordinary profit.</p>



<p>The full-year forecast is even better, given the imminent launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> (on February 27, 2026) and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> (on March 13, 2026). Both games will be released before the end of CAPCOM's fiscal year, which is scheduled for March 31, 2026. With their help, <strong>the publisher is targeting net sales of $1.2 billion</strong>, operating profit of $477 million, and ordinary profit of $458 million. </p>



<p>That's just the beginning of the publisher's calendar year. For the next fiscal year, CAPCOM already has two potential heavy-hitters: the third-person action/adventure game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRAGMATA</a></strong> (an interesting new IP, based on our Gamescom hands-on) and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a></strong>, the long-awaited new installment in the Onimusha franchise. The former is launching on April 24, 2026, while the latter still doesn't have a final release date.</p>



<p>Of course, CAPCOM also continues to bet on the solid performance of its catalog titles. This fiscal year, <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> was the top performer, likely due to deep discounts. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> hasn't performed very well, but it still reached <strong>11 million</strong> total units sold since its launch in February 2025. Even with the recent sales slowdown, <strong>it's the studio's fastest-selling game to date</strong>, narrowly beating its predecessor, <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong>, which took a little longer to get to 11 million units sold.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>25/12 (Millions)</strong></td><td><strong>Lifetime (Millions)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></td><td>2.43</td><td>11.00</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></td><td>2.34</td><td>12.26</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></td><td>2.28</td><td>13.59</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></td><td>1.69</td><td>6.36</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</strong></td><td>1.68</td><td>16.47</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 2</strong></td><td>1.46</td><td>16.87</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></td><td>1.10</td><td>18.27</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 3</strong></td><td>1.09</td><td>10.99</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</strong></td><td>1.03</td><td>10.91</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></td><td>0.99</td><td>11.10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Perhaps the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PC performance patch</a> will reignite interest in Monster Hunter Wilds. Otherwise, it might be difficult to beat Monster Hunter World's total record sales of <strong>over 22 million units</strong> sold to date.</p>
