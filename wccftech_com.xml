			<p>It's been nearly a year and a half since we <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard from BioShock creator Ken Levine</a>. As you're probably aware, ever since disbanding Irrational Games, he has founded a smaller studio called Ghost Story Games. For the last eight years or so, they have worked on a game that we now know to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a>, a game that is based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levine's concept of 'narrative LEGOs'</a> to be endlessly replayable, at least in theory.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the BioShock creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzERtlBcB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview with Lawrence Sonntag from Nightdive Studios</a>. In the hour-long conversation, Levine promised that Judas would be an old-school single player games and expressed gratitude to parent company Take-Two Interactive that they weren't forced to add any live service elements with additional monetization like microtransactions.</p>



<p><em>I grew up playing single player games, and I grew up before certain types of monetization existed. And again, I'm not here at all to say this is bad or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kind of games I like to make. Judas is a very old-school game. Like, you buy the game and get the whole thing. There's no live service, because everything that we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere. This is no diss on any developers who've done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate that we work at a company where they believe at least in us enough where they will say okay, you're going to work on this thing for a long time, and it's going to cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not going to push any of that stuff on you.<br></em></p>



<p><em>But I understand why it happens, right? And I don't blame anybody for trying to make a living, but I like making the games I want to play, and the kind of games I want to play are I just want to have an experience with a game and have that game be just that. All it wants to do is entertain me, right? It's got no other ulterior motives and Judas and our games have not had ulterior motives. And I'm lucky that we've been able to do that. It's a difficult time in the industry, as you know, and not everybody is as lucky as we are that we get to make a game that can really just pursue the player's joy. I think unwisely the industry has decided that you need all these elements, but if you look at the games that have really landed in the past couple of years, they are the games providing this, whether it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. These are really traditional single player games and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audience has rewarded those games, especially in the AAA space, because it gets so expensive that people want other methods of monetization. I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not have to do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience.</em></p>



<p>Understandably, the Ken Levine creator does not really reveal any significant new details about his next game, Judas, which remains without a release window. That said, for all we know, it could change either at Gamescom or at The Game Awards. Here's hoping anyway, as the actual new BioShock installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still seems far from launching</a>.</p>

			<p>Project Titan, the codename for the next game from Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, appears to have been cancelled. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lwgzeh/titan_project_of_striking_distance_from_the/">Reddit</a>, a senior technical artist at Striking Distance Studios, which was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield as a subsidiary under Krafton, listed Project Titan as a cancelled game that they worked on. They listed their tasks on the project as character, weapon, and prop setup and rigging, which were also tasks they did when working on The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>When Striking Distance Studios (SDS) was first announced as a new team with Schofield leading the way, there were a lot of reasons to be excited about the new studio. It was a team of veteran developers, all coming together to leverage what was at the time the next generation of consoles, and though we didn't know it for sure at the time, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-to-glen-schofield-about-striking-distance-cinematic-narrative-experience-set-in-pubg/">Wccftech spoke to Schofield</a> about the "<em>cinematic narrative experience</em>" they were creating at SDS, we could only hope that the team was making a game akin to Dead Space.</p>



<p>Fans of horror games, like myself, got their wish when The Callisto Protocol was revealed. It was billed as a 'spiritual successor' to Dead Space, and with Schofield directly behind the project, it felt like there was potential for a new series of horror games. </p>



<p>Obviously, that is not how things panned out. The Callisto Protocol seemed to have a myriad of issues even in development, as Schofield publicly discussed what appeared to be a pretty<a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/"> awful period of crunch that the team went through.</a> Then, when it arrived, it did so to middling reviews across the board, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">including from us here at Wccftech</a>.</p>



<p>It didn't help that EA released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">stunning remake of the game that</a>, for all intents and purposes, launched Schofield's career to a new level a month after The Callisto Protocol failed to impress, but the success of EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is hardly what stopped The Callisto Protocol from taking off. Schofield later revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-was-released-too-early-admits-glen-schofield/">the game was launched too early,</a> and that part of the crunch issues the team suffered came from Krafton not giving the team approximately three to four more months to complete their work on the game that they thought they were going to have.</p>



<p>SDS suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-layoffs-future-projects/">multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">layoffs</a>, and Schofield ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">left the studio</a> less than a year after the game's launch and subsequent failure. Last year, we learned that the team was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">working on a new game, </a>which was presumably the now-cancelled Project Titan. It's unfortunate that a team with such high hopes has had such a tragic journey. Hopefully, there's a better chapter to come for the team with their next project, and the next time we hear about Striking Distance Studios isn't to find out that they've been shut down.</p>
