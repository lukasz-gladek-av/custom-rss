			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring Nightreign launches next week. Ahead of the much-hyped debut, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Game Director Junya Ishizaki to dive deeper into the multiplayer spin-off game.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms levied at Elden Ring Nightreign so far is that, according to FromSoftware, it is tailored either for playing solo or with a party of three players. Ishizaki-san admitted that duo groups have been overlooked during the development phase, but added that it is being looked and proper support may be added after launch.</p>
<p><em>The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</em></p>
<p>There's also no PvP whatsoever in Elden Ring Nightreign, unlike Elden Ring itself. Ishizaki said that it was never even considered:</p>
<p><em>From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be veryâ€¦ Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is launching on May 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Check out our latest preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Capcom has been on a pretty incredible hot streak since 2017, with Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, and Street Fighter all playing huge roles in the company's growth and success since.</p>
<p>The company has grown significantly since its biggest series all started to take off in record-breaking ways, and in its latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0ZYaiinJ8">presentation</a> to investors regarding its recent financial results for its previous fiscal year, Capcom laid out even more plans to expand.</p>
<p>A key point in its expansion is the announcement of a new development hub that will be built near the company's headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Reported by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/406072">GameBiz</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-to-continue-upsizing-workforce-by-100-employees-each-year/">Automaton</a>), the building is scheduled to be finished in 2027 and will be a new office meant to help Capcom accelerate its development capabilities. It's described as a new environment where "<em>creators can unleash their talents fully</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also reiterated its plans to continue hiring 100 new employees every year. In an age when so many others are looking towards generative AI and other technology to boost their potential, Capcom recognizes human talent as the "<em>essential driver of growth</em>."</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the best-selling game of 2025 so far, and after 2023's excellent remake of Resident Evil 4, fans of the long-running horror series are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the studio has in store for<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/"> Resident Evil 9</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has revealed gameplay for the next character joining the roster, Ultron, and showcased more of what's to come in Season 2.5 ahead of its launch next week on&nbsp;<strong>May 30, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The studio also released the latest <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250520/41548_1235575.html">patch notes</a> for the game's most recent update, which includes all the balance changes and fixes made.</p>
<p>The Hellfire Gala Moments event has been extended for another week in the back-half of this season, and on top of adding Ultron to the game, NetEase is also adding a new map and making some significant changes to Team-Up abilities, like the addition of the Jeff-Nado ability.</p>

<p>Season 2.5 will also include a new limited-time mode to be added on June 6 called Ultron's Battle Matrix Protocol. The mode lets six players choose their own hero lineups and upgrade their abilities before going head-to-head against other players. According to a press release for the new update, the mode is "<em>an experiment for how the development team can attempt to fulfill players' fantasies of Marvel Super Heroes and Super Villains</em>."</p>

<p>Season 2 is the last season that'll have the three-month-long structure, NetEase revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/"> last month</a> ahead of the launch for Season 2. Beginning with Season 3, a full season in Marvel Rivals will last for only two months, with a new character and features added each month. Season 2 also introduced weekly missions to give players even more to do on top of the preexisting daily challenges.</p>
