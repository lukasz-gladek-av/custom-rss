			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than two weeks at the time of this writing, and according to the latest report of <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to">The Game Business</a>, it has already lost some ground in the EU sales charts in its second week on the market. Meanwhile, games that haven't been in the charts for some time reappeared, thanks to favourable Black Friday sales.</p>



<p>In its launch week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to reach the top of the charts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">though its numbers were 63% worse than Battlefield 6</a>. In its second week (November 17-23), it fell to the number two spot in the charts, with EA Sports FC 26 overtaking it on both the revenue chart and the units sold chart.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6, meanwhile, stayed within the top five, but made it in the number three spot, just behind Black Ops 7 on both charts. Other recent releases like Anno 117: Pax Romana and Pokémon Legends Z-A were able to keep their spots in the top ten for both lists, <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">while Football Manager 26 has seemingly disappeared after its standout opening week</a>.</p>



<p>The only other new addition to the list with regard to newly released games is Kirby Air Riders, which barely scratched into the revenue list in the number ten spot. The rest of the new additions to either chart came from Black Friday sales, boosting older titles. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and It Takes Two both reappeared in the charts due to the holiday sales.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top ten best-selling games by units sold in the EU per GSD Data for the week of November 17-23:</p>

<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>
