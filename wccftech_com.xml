			<p>Hitman World of Assassination has officially reached over 75 million players worldwide, which means that this game is the most successful Hitman game of all time. This new was announced today by IO Interactive, the developer and publisher behind the incredibly popular franchise. Since its launch, Hitman World of Assassination has now surpassed 75 million players worldwide. This milestone is just another checkmark for the team, as they have known the success of the game since it was first released. This title has achieved the franchise's highest Metacritic score with the release of Hitman III in 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the franchise, Hitman World of Assassination is a bit more unique, as it allows players to be stealthy while also getting stuck into dramatic action, and allows players to come up with a multitude of ways to assassinate a target or knock them out and hide them.</p>
<p>The game has plenty of interesting characters to get to know or even assassinate, and there are tons of opportunities to carry out a contract. Hitman World of Assassination doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, either.</p>

<p>Since the release of this game, there have been a ton of updates, adding in new live content that contains new locations, contracts, events, and even collaborations with famous people who then get to become a contract in the game. December saw a million active players, and the game continues to remain popular and played by many. 2025 will get more missions for players to run through, as new updates are released by the team hard at work.</p>
<p>Most recently, players were given the opportunity to see Jean-Claude Van Damme in Hitman World of Assassination as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-cut-ties-with-conor-mcgregor-after-court-ruling/">Elusive Target</a> Max Valliant, who is a former ICA operative and others already thought he had been eliminated years ago, but was found to be alive and dealing with secret organizations. This particular mission has been completed by 40% of the players, with a fair few getting far in the mission but struggling to take down the target thanks to his skill set.</p>
<p>One player in particular took more than seven hours to complete the mission, to make sure that they were as thorough as possible in the mission before assassinating the target. Contrasting this playthrough, the fastest player ended the mission within 21 seconds.</p>
<p>The Splitter will be available in Hitman World of Assassination until January 12, giving players the opportunity to try out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new mission</a> before it disappears.</p>
