			<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved,</a> which confirmed that the longtime Xbox-exclusive series would be coming to PlayStation, GameStop posted a lengthy statement about it being the end of the console wars. The White House, of all entities, responded with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">AI-generated photo of Donald Trump in Spartan armor,</a> as if to depict him as the protagonist in Halo, Master Chief. Shortly after that, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used more Halo imagery <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">to promote its own political agenda</a>, and has even followed it up with a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">similar post co-opting Lord of the Rings</a>. </p>



<p>And the DHS has made it clear that it will not stop there, which we know thanks to a report from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261">independent journalist Alyssa Mercante</a>, who obtained a statement from the DHS after inquiring about its use of Halo imagery. At the time of her inquiry, the Lord of the Rings post had not been made, though it would go out shortly after this statement was delivered: </p>



<p>"<em>We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of The Rings, or any other medium. DHS remains laser focused on bringing awareness to the flood of crime that criminal illegal aliens have inflicted on our country. We aren’t slowing down. - DHS SPOX</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Microsoft has yet to make an official comment on the DHS using Halo to promote its own political agenda, nor has Amazon, which currently holds the rights to The Lord of the Rings, made a statement regarding whether the use of these images was approved. </p>



<p>Both Amazon and Microsoft, if they were so inclined, could have the images taken down, and while the lack of any statement doesn't explicitly confirm they agree with the posts in question and how they are being used, not saying anything at the very least admits that neither party will stop the DHS from continuing to use franchises like Halo and The Lord of the Rings in the future.</p>



<p>Individual Halo creators have made statements, however, with Marcus Lehto, a co-creator of Halo and the lead designer of the character Master Chief, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that "<em>It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this</em>."</p>



<p>Jaime Griesemer, a lead designer of the original Halo games at Bungie, added, "<em>Halo is a cultural icon and like anything with cultural capital, it is going to be used by politicians and brands and anyone else looking for relevancy</em>. <em>Usually, I take it as a compliment to Halo’s continuing legacy</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Using Halo imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation</em>. <em>I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.</em>"</p>

			<p>So far, GTA London 1969 remains the only installment in the franchise to take place outside of the United States. Fans have long wondered if Rockstar would ever return to London or perhaps even bring the series elsewhere in the world. </p>



<p>However, based on the statement relayed by Dan Houser (who wrote all the games in the series save for the upcoming sixth), that seems unlikely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, he explained that the franchise is intrinsically linked to American culture. </p>



<p><em>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Houser <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Rockstar Games in early 2020</a>, so it isn't really up to him anymore. That said, having worked there for twenty-two years, he certainly has a sound inkling as to the way the studio thinks about its prized IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsewhere in the interview</a>, Dan Houser mentioned that his favorite character in the series was GTA IV's Niko Bellic, as the most earnest and nicest of all, although he also mentioned CJ from San Andreas and Michael De Santa from GTA V as standout, partly due to the respective voice actors doing a great job at bringing them to life.</p>



<p>Houser then said he isn't worried about generative-trained large language models taking the jobs of writers because he reckons that LLMs can only create cheap, decent stuff, but are unable to come out with new, interesting ideas, which is where 'magic' comes from in writing.</p>
