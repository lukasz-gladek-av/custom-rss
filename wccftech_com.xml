			<p>FromSoftware has elected to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-coming-next-week/">Elden Ring Nightreign update 1.02</a>, which would have added the highly-requested duos mode to the game, due to tsunami warnings following a major earthquake on Russia's coast. An earthquake that hit the Kamchatka Peninsula off the coast of Russia earlier Wednesday morning has sent tsunami waves towards Russia, Japan, and Hawaii, with each region on alert. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/article/88-magnitude-earthquake-sends-tsunami-into-coasts-of-russia-japan-and-hawaii/">CTV News</a>, the earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded at an 8.8 magnitude, and sent at least one tsunami wave of up to 13 feet to the shore of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. Though it's been several hours since the initial earthquake, Japan has kept its northern regions at high alert, while the alert has been lowered to an advisory in its more southern regions.</p>



<p>"<em>Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT</em>,<em>"</em> FromSoftware wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884">post on X</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, the second cycle of Everdark Sovereign, which was scheduled to start at 03:00 CEST | 18:00 PDT (7/30) tomorrow, will also be delayed until after the update file has been distributed.</em> <em>Thank you for understanding</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While players who are looking forward to the update might be upset to learn that they'll have to wait a little longer to play Nightreign in an official duos mode, a tsunami is a more than reasonable reason to delay anything. Hopefully, the warnings and alerts pass with the waves causing minimal or better yet, no damage, and no one is hurt. We'll update you when FromSoftware confirms the new release window for the update.</p>

			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not arrived on consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-drops-on-consoles-on-july-15/">15 days ago</a> from the time of this writing. In its first four days on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S shelves, it sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-past-1-million-copies-sold-consoles-10-million-total-copies-sold/">1 million copies</a>, bringing the game's total sales to 10 million between consoles and PC. In the remaining 11 days, it sold another million copies, marking another huge milestone for the tactical shooter by hitting 2 million copies in just two weeks, and 11 million copies sold since its initial PC launch.</p>



<p>"<em>First, thank you to the players - for showing up, playing hard, and bringing order to chaos</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julio-rodriguez-2591bb10_readyornot-consolelaunch-2million-activity-7356271625538846720-imwP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Next, to the VOID dev team for building what we believe is the quintessential tactical FPS of our era — and to our friends and partners for helping us bring RON to console.</em>"</p>

<p>Ready or Not's console launch is clearly going well, but its success on PS5 and Xbox Series devices hasn't diminished how upset its PC player base has been since the console update, which brought a number of changes that didn't sit well with PC players.</p>



<p>Players have called out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">changes </a>to certain aspects of the game censorship, and while it's clear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">review bombing on Steam</a> that a good chunk of the player base agrees, another element to this that players on PC are upset with is what players are calling a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1md3lai/i_have_some_questions_regarding_the_recent/">"<em>downgrade</em>"</a> in the graphics to align with the console versions.</p>



<p>We'll see how VOID Interactive responds in the coming weeks, and if there are any meaningful retractions from the studio to appease the players it has upset.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-paragon-antiquary-ritualist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-unveils-paragon-antiquary-and-ritualist-elite-specs.1257069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet unveiled the second trio of elite specializations that will be introduced in the upcoming expansion Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity. Following the Troubadour, the Galeshot, and the Luminary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-three-elite-specializations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last week</a>, this time it's all about the Paragon, Antiquary, and Ritualist.</p>



<p>The Ritualist is an elite specialization for the Necromancer. It's inspired by the original Guild Wars Ritualist profession, and it summons weapon spells that affect nearby allies. It also summons the spirits of Anguish, Wanderlust, and Preservation to attack foes.</p>



<p>The Antiquary is the new elite specialization for the Thief. As purveyors of rare artifacts, Antiquaries use their Pilfer skill to call upon the thieving inclination of their Skritt companions. They steal from enemies to create random improvised weapons. The Antiquary can use its unique skills while on cooldown, but doing so may cause detrimental effects, making it a risky proposition.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, there's the Paragon, a new elite specialization for the Warrior. With spear and shield in hand, these protectors of Elona build up their motivation resource by using burst skills. They can channel this motivation into vocal shouts, such as chants, refrains, commands, and echoes. These affect the surrounding area, either punishing enemies or supporting allies of the Paragon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Presumably, ArenaNet will share the final three elite specializations for the remaining classes (Revenant, Engineer, and Elementalist) at some point next week. As a reminder, Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released on October 28</a>; beyond the new elite specializations, it'll offer brand new zones, new raid encounters, a new Fractal, a new Convergence, a new Homestead map, three new Mastery tracks for the Skimmer aquatic mount and various new armor, weapons, legendaries, and relics. The story itself centers around the Inquest's nefarious plan for the island of Castora.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, July 31, 2025. It'll be a 25-minute-long presentation of games from Nintendo's publishing partners, so it's unlikely that we'll get announcements like the release date for Metroid Prime 4. But it could be the kind of place where we see the release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, but it's the kind of news to expect instead of any news about Nintendo's first-party titles, as those are the kinds of announcements Nintendo would likely hold for a dedicated 'Nintendo Direct.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">rumors circulating </a>about a Nintendo Direct happening before the end of July, as a follow-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, to let players know what's coming next for the console. Those rumors were seemingly correct, though not about it being a full-fat Nintendo Direct that would include first-party announcements.</p>



<p>Which could, of course, mean indie titles like Silksong and Hades II show up. Though it could also, and potentially even more likely, mean that we see more ports of games that are already available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series devices that the Nintendo Switch wasn't capable of running, but the Switch 2 can run perfectly well. </p>



<p>Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Hi-Fi Rush, Assassin's Creed Mirage, or news of a release date for some of the major ports already announced, like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever's there, thankfully we won't have long to wait to find out, as the direct will kick off tomorrow morning at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.</p>
