			<p>The <strong>next-gen Xbox console</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which we know will <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-developing-custom-chips-microsoft-power-next-gen-xbox-consoles-pcs-handhelds/">be powered by a <strong>semi-custom SoC</strong> currently in development from <strong>AMD</strong></a>, is "<em>progressing well to <strong>support a launch in</strong> <strong>2027</strong></em>," said AMD's chief executive officer, <strong>Dr. Lisa Siu</strong>, during the <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1276/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results">company's 2025 fourth quarter earnings call</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle," </em>Dr. Siu said on the call<em>. "From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year. And <strong>development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Dr. Siu's comment about the Steam Machine isn't anything new, as it only corroborates what <strong>Valve</strong> has said regarding the release of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">which have always had an <strong>"<em>early 2026</em>"</strong> release window</a>. It's her comments on the next-gen Xbox that are worth noting, which give credence to rumours we heard last year that also identified a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">2027 release window</a></strong> for the next-generation device. </p>



<p>Of course, her comment doesn't mean you should write 'next-gen Xbox release' in your 2027 calendar, because it will ultimately be Microsoft's call as to when the device launches. What her comments do mean is that if Microsoft is in fact ready to launch this next-gen device in 2027, then AMD is currently on track to support that launch.</p>



<p>Officially, we don't know a lot about this next-generation device. Microsoft and Xbox have hinted at what it will be like, with Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> hinting that the device will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>,"</a> while also adding that we can look to <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">how the <strong>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</strong> operates in a space between console and PC</a> as to what Microsoft is trying to build with this new hardware.</p>



<p>Everything else we know about the device comes from reports and rumours, some of them supported by official comments, like how Bond calling it a "<em>very high-end</em>" device supports the rumour that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">it'll cost somewhere in the range of <strong>$1,000</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Or how allusions from Bond and Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, about the device being a <strong>PC/console hybrid</strong> support rumours that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">Microsoft is testing how it would put <strong>Steam</strong> on this new device</a>, which is further <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-features-xbox-game-dev-kit-point-next-gen-xbox-pc-console-hybrid/">supported by features added to software updates for Xbox development kits</a>.</p>



<p>Other questions about the console, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-controller-with-dualsense-like-haptics-is-reportedly-still-on-the-way-for-next-gen/">features the controller will include</a>, whether it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-digital-next-gen-sony-nintendo/">be a <strong>fully digital device</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">if it'll have <strong>backwards compatibility</strong></a><strong>, </strong>remain bigger questions for now. But at least we know that AMD is ready for it to arrive next year. Hopefully, Microsoft will be ready to launch next year, too, and we can learn more about what the company's plans are for its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">as console sales continue to <strong>decline each quarter significantly</strong></a>. </p>

			<p><strong>Take-Two Interactive's</strong> <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings">third-quarter financial results have been published</a>, which means there's plenty of information to glean from the company behind <strong>2K</strong> and <strong>Rockstar's</strong> latest numbers. What everyone wants to hear about, though, is <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which may just be the most anticipated video game ever, and in the meantime, <strong>GTA V</strong> has hit yet another astronomical sales milestone.</p>



<p>While Take-Two's chief executive officer, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, didn't get too deep into what's coming for <strong>GTA VI</strong>, he did confirm in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">The Game Business</a> and during the call with investors that we can expect more "<em>marketing beats</em>" for the game during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. He also reaffirmed the game's release date, which is, as of the time of this writing, still set to be <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>We feel great about it</em>," Zelnick told The Game Business. He added, "<em>You know me pretty well, for me to even say we've got marketing beats coming this summer, is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, on GTA VI's release date, we heard that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">November date is a "<em>more real</em>" release window than its previous 2025 date</a>. Before that, Zelnick said <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">his confidence level that the game would not be delayed was <strong>"<em>very, very high</em>."</strong></a> Everything Take-Two is projecting in this report supports that it will indeed be launching this coming November. Hopefully, that's still the case the closer we get to the date, though a lot can always change in the coming months. </p>



<p>Regarding GTA V's new sales milestone, Take-Two reports that the game has sold an astounding <strong>225 million copies</strong> over the last decade plus. It adds that the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series has, overall, sold a whopping <strong>465 million copies</strong> in its lifetime, which means that on its own, GTA V accounts for almost half of all copies of a Grand Theft Auto game that have been sold since the series launched in 1997.</p>



<p>Overall, Take-Two reported <strong>$1.76 billion</strong> in net bookings, well above its projected $1.6 billion for its third quarter, with Grand Theft Auto contributing its fair share to the increase in revenue. <strong>GTA Online,</strong> for its part, saw a <strong>27% increase</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>While everything is coming up roses in Take-Two's financials, its subsidiary and Grand Theft Auto VI developer, Rockstar, continues to be under pressure from unions over the firing of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">31 workers in the UK</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">three workers in Canada</a></strong>. Rockstar continues to claim that these workers were leaking confidential information, while the IWGB union representing the fired workers continues to refute those claims and accuses Rockstar of union-busting.</p>



<p>The most recent update in that case was <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">a UK judge denying the fired workers' interim pay</a>, though the case itself is far from over.</p>
