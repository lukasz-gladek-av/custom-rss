			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>

			<p>Publisher HyperTrain Digital and developer Ice-Pick Lodge have announced that Pathologic 3 will arrive on PC this coming January 9, 2026, though if you can't wait until then, there's a demo available to check out now as part of October's Steam Next Fest, which kicked off today and runs until October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>If you're worried about Pathologic 3 potentially being delayed, no need, as Ice-Pick Lodge makes it clear that its January release date is as set in stone as can be in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">a post on the game's Steam page</a>. "<em>That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isnâ€™t moving</em>," the studio writes.</p>



<p>Ice-Pick Lodge also debuted a new trailer for Pathologic 3 as part of the demo's arrival and the announcement of its "<em>nailed down, screwed in</em>" release date. This trailer does its best to show the many sides of Pathologic 3, to try and give players an understanding of the game's complexities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The demo is a small slice from the beginning of the game, with Daniil Dankovsky arriving in the City-on-Gorkhon, looking for an immortal man.</p>



<p>Pathologic 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/">announced in October 2024 with a 2025 release window</a>, though today's news reveals that Ice-Pick Lodge will just slightly miss that release window by nine days. It's also not the only game with a Steam Next Fest demo, as you can also find demos for <a href="https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/">games like Ash and Steel</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">Lovecraftian survival horror shooter Beneath</a> during the festival. </p>
