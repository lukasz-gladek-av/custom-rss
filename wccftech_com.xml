			<p>Today, South Korean developer and publisher NEOWIZ (Lies of P) announced the signing of a new publishing deal with the Chinese company Shadowlight. Founded in Shanghai by five recent graduates, this team has known each other for years and participated in many university-level game development competitions in China, earning numerous awards. In 2023, HYPERGRYPH, the developer of Arknights, invested in Shadowlight and has been part of their COREBLAZER incubator program ever since.</p>
<p>The publishing deal is for an upcoming detective adventure game titled Kill the Shadow, which is centered on a protagonist who can rewind time. Kill the Shadow features a unique aesthetic that blends high-definition 3D environments with 2D pixel characters. In Kill the Shadow, players must investigate and deduce various bizarre cases in an alternate post-war divided city. During Steam Next Fest last year, Shadowlight <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947640/Kill_The_Shadow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a demo of the game, which received a very positive user rating. Several comments praised the game's story, reasoning system and visual novelty.</p>
<p>Kim Seung-chul, Co-CEO at NEOWIZ, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>What initially drew us to Shadowlight was a collaborative development philosophy to deliver premium narrative games for PC and console audiences. We look forward to working closely with the team to release Kill the Shadow globally, and we hope audiences find the same charm we experienced as we reveal more about the title.</em></p>
<p>Black, CEO of Shadowlight, added:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is a reliable global publisher, and we were grateful to find a partner who shares our philosophy on game development. As we see the games industry evolve to be inclusive of other cultures, it’s important to have a publisher that is open to collaborating and emphasizing the significance of your content.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, NEOWIZ has recently signed other publishing deals with Western developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfeye Studios</a>, Zakazane, and Lizard Smoothie.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> feels way more restrictive than your typical soulslike, and many of its central mechanics have been designed to urge Nightfarers to explore Limveld quickly to level up and obtain as many upgrades as possible to be able to stand a chance against the Nightlord waiting at the end of any Expedition. One of the most restrictive mechanics of the game is the Night Tide mechanics, which effectively impose a time limit during Day 1 and Day 2. Once the Night Tide starts moving, certain parts of the map will essentially become inaccessible, as staying outside the safe circle will deal constant damage to the Nightfarer.</p>
<p>The fact that the Night Nide constantly damages Nightfarers in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> also acts as a sort of secondary limitation for Day 2. After defeating the boss, the only thing you can do inside the safe circle is to head over to the Spirit Shelter to get ready to face the Nightlord, so most players do so to continue the Expedition. What many don't know, however, is that <strong>there's a way to extend Day 2 almost indefinitely to get more Runes and upgrades and get better chances to defeat the Nightlord in Day 3.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603131423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike Day 1, <strong>Day 2 doesn't end automatically shortly after defeating the boss, and only does so when players enter the Spirit Shelter</strong>. As such, with the exception of the bosses roaming the field outside of locations like Castles and Camps,<strong> the state of the map remains the same as before</strong>. Churches will still feature Flask upgrades if they haven't been picked, undefeated mobs will still be out in the field, and all location bosses will still be in their place, waiting for you. <strong>This means that you can still obtain Runes and every other type of upgrade as if you were playing the game normally during daytime</strong>, only that you will have to constantly heal with your Flask, and use Sites of Grace, which continue to function normally even when inside the Night Tide. <strong>If you plan your journey properly, have the maximum amount of Flask uses, and use the Sites of Grace to restore your healing charges, you can continue defeating bosses and improve your character until you can clear the entire map, </strong>if the situation allows. And even if, by chance, you are killed, you can try again as many times as you like, as the penalties for dying at the end of Day 2 will be the same as those when dying during daytime, so you will lose one level and all your runes.</p>
<p>Employing this strategy effectively at the end of Day 2 requires some planning, excellent knowledge of the Elden Ring Nightreign mechanics, and a bit of luck, but not only can it be a great help, it can also make the experience even more thrilling and fun. Give it a try while playing solo, and it won't take long for you to see how viable this actually is. Seeing as this is probably unintended, the ability to continue exploring without a time limit at the end of Day 2 may get patched out, so make sure to take advantage of it while you still can.</p>
