			<p>Resident Evil 9 has high chance of being revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest, according to a reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> today, well-known insider Dusk Golem said that, while they cannot 100% confirm it, they are like 95% positive that the next main entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM will be revealed during Summer Game Fest. This assumption is based on the fact that this is the first time behind the scenes that there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings, and the type of activity that is usually a sign that a new Resident Evil game is being announced very soon. Hopefully, the insider is correct, and we will finally see exactly how Resident Evil 9 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a> in a few days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(1/3) Again, not like I can give 100% confirmation, no one's directly told me or the like. But at this point I'm like 95% positive we're on the verge of RE9 being revealed at SGF. This is the first time behind the scenes there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings <a href="https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA">https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA</a></p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468556498153933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(3/3) and I'd say if you're tuning into Summer Game Fest on June 6th hoping that Resident Evil 9 will show up, there's an incredibly high chance you won't be disappointed. I'm getting into hype mode for it myself.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468559148605517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Resident Evil 9 has been in development for quite some time, and the game went through different iterations before becoming the game we will likely be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">next year</a>. Back in 2017, the game started development as an <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-world multiplayer game</a> that was meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, which wasn't doing too well on the market. In 2021, development was rebooted, and most of the original version's concept and features were scrapped, though the final game still retains some elements of the premise and Leon as the main protagonist.</p>
<p>This year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest show</a>, where Resident Evil 9 has a high chance of making an appearance, airs&nbsp;later this week on June 6th.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-launches-new-website-starts-hiring-for-unannounced-action-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-launches-new-website-starts-hiring-for-unannounced-action-game.1204275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-launches-new-website-starts-hiring-for-unannounced-action-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and The Evil Within series development studio Tango Gameworks launched its new website today to celebrate the studio's rebranding and the start of hiring for its next unannounced project.</p>
<p>The studio's new website, which can be reached <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, features the studio's new logo, representing the beginning of a new era for the developer and the studio's vision as a "creative workshop." As mentioned above, the studio now also has several open positions for the development of an unannounced action game that will likely be the sequel to the popular Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks was originally shut down<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"> last year</a>, together with Arkane Austin and a few other studios. While the closure of the developer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/">Redfall</a> didn't exactly come as a shock, considering how the game failed to deliver on all fronts, the closure of the Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within development studio was way more surprising, considering the success of their action game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-seemingly-had-at-least-one-unannounced-title-in-the-works-ex-programmer-resume-mentions/">the unannounced projects</a> that were seemingly in the works. Thankfully, the Japanese Studio didn't stay disbanded for long, as it was acquired by Krafton, PUBG's publisher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/">last August</a>, alongside the intellectual property of the popular action game. The other franchises developed by the studio, The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo, are still owned by Microsoft, so it may be a long time before we see new entries in the series, if ever.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-new-mods-uncap-the-framerate-introduce-two-player-mode-and-easier-solo-mode.1204257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Elden Ring Nightreign mods shared online over the past few days address some of the game's biggest issues, making the experience more enjoyable for PC players.</p>
<p>The first of these new mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnlockTheFPS mod</a>, a fork of the same mod developed for the original Elden Ring, which allows players to set a maximum FPS value. As the vanilla game is unsurprisingly locked at 60 FPS, this mod is highly welcome for all those who want to play the game at higher framerates.</p>
<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign UnlockTheFPS mod is fully compatible with another mod that was<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod/"> teased</a> shortly after the game launched last week, the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3"> Seamless Co-op mod</a>, which introduces a two-player mode. As this mod doesn't connect to the matchmaking servers and uses a different save file from progression, it is also safe to use without getting banned.</p>
<p>As the entire experience was balanced around co-op, Elden Ring Nightreign is quite challenging in solo mode, and many are struggling even getting to the final day without the help of other players or being forced to use certain Nightfarers and strategies. While a patch is coming at some point this week to introduce some balance changes for solo play, those who do not want to wait can test out the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/34?tab=files">Balancing For Solo Players mod</a>, which introduces better stats scaling per level and reduces received damage considerably.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-showcased-in-new-leaked-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battlefield 6 video</a> has been leaked on YouTube. It's a six-minute-long footage that primarily shows off the amazing destruction that players will see in the upcoming installment of the military first-person shooter franchise.</p>
<p>Battlefield games have become synonymous with destruction since 2008's Bad Company, which featured the debut of DICE's Frostbite engine. However, 2021's failed Battlefield 2042 toned it down considerably. With the new game, DICE seems to be focusing on one of the IP's most distinctive features once again.</p>
<p>As a reminder, DICE is being helped by Motive Studios, Ripple Effect Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-co-developed-criterion-need-for-speed-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Criterion</a> on Battlefield 6.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Destruction Full HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/naqI1yhobIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of those teams, Motive Studios (which recently did the Dead Space remake and is also working on an Iron Man game), is in charge of the campaign mode of Battlefield 6. In a recent interview, the Creative Director (Roman Campos-Oriola) and Executive Producer (Philippe Ducharme) mentioned influences from Alex Garland's Civil War film and the TV show Lioness. They also detailed some of the themes that will be featured in the story:</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Motive is also looking to bring over the team's mentality acquired during the development of the Dead Space remake to Battlefield 6.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will be officially unveiled this Summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-modding-could-be-bigger-than-ever-says-naturalvision-creator/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now officially less than a year from the release date of GTA VI, provided that there are no further delays, that is. Even GTA V modders are starting to look with anticipation at Rockstar's massively anticipated sequel; Razed, the creator of the stunning <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-natural-vision-enhanced-mod-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NaturalVision visual overhaul mod</a> for Grand Theft Auto V, has discussed the upcoming game's modding potential <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/according-to-steam-i-have-around-10-000-hours-logged-says-the-modder-whos-spent-a-decade-turning-gta-5-into-a-photo-realistic-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><em>I think modding is going to be bigger than ever once GTA VI eventually drops on PC. I'm hopeful Rockstar will give players official tools to mod the game, especially with the direction they're heading with FiveM. There's a ton of potential here. Imagine if they took a page out of Bethesda's playbook and introduced a proper marketplace for user-generated content. It could benefit both mod creators and Rockstar in a big way. I'd like to see something like that happen.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd love to create mods for GTA VI, but it still feels a little too early to get into the specifics of what that might look like. Honestly, I don't think visual overhaul mods will be in high demand this time around. The game already looks incredible. If anything, I think I'd really enjoy making content for people to use on their custom servers, like exterior map packs or custom interiors.</em></p>
<p>Razed was referring to the popular FiveM roleplaying servers that Rockstar originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-bans-users-affiliation-fivem-gta-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a> and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a>. It is indeed likely to see them playing a major role in Grand Theft Auto VI, at least on PC. There was even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> recently that Rockstar was indeed looking to place a much bigger focus on Roblox-style user-generated content.</p>
<p>Of course, PC gamers will have to wait longer to actually play the game, although the CEO of Corsair Gaming previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it could be just a few months rather than a full year before the PC version is released. For PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, GTA VI is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to debut on May 26, 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-gemini-due-to-failed-deal-with-square-enix-will-scale-down-teams/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced the cancellation of two projects: Project Gemini and Project Bifrost.</p>
<p>People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1929140540697727466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> the news earlier today on X:</p>
<p><em>Today, we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of Project Gemini and Project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market. The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</em></p>
<p><em>Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project. As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most. We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point.</em></p>
<p>Project Gemini was being developed for publisher Square Enix and already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-removes-30-developers-from-unannounced-square-enix-game-project-gemini-to-shrink-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a shrunken scope and the layoff of 30 developers in early 2024. People Can Fly had previously worked with Square Enix on Outriders. As for Project Bifrost, it was slated to be the last Virtual Reality game made by the studio, as they recognized that there wasn't enough of a market for VR yet.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, People Can Fly had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-dagger-action-adventure-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Project Dagger, a new IP in the action/adventure genre that would have been published by Take-Two. Even with all these failed projects, the Polish team is still working <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Gears of War: E-Day for Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another unknown game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>
