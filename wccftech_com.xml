			<p>A Dino Crisis remake was reportedly attempted twice, but the projects were later scrapped due to low quality.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on X, known CAPCOM leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a> revealed that, in the past few years, CAPCOM attempted to bring back the survival horror series with a remake of the first game. The first attempt was from CAPCOM Vancouver before they were shut down, while the second one was from an unspecified CAPCOM team a few years ago. This project, however, wasn't turning out good and was eventually scrapped.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) I hope Capcom eventually figures out what they want to do with Dino Crisis. For the record, &amp; I don't believe this is new info, but there has been a couple attempts in the last decade to remake Dino Crisis, the first by Capcom Vancouver before they were shut down (still <a href="https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX">https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763101613318388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although previous attempts at developing a Dino Crisis remake have reportedly failed, there's a good chance the classic survival horror series may be close to a comeback. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Earlier this year</a>, the series was trademarked again in Japan, something that is usually done in the country when there's a real intention of using an IP again, and in Brazil a few months ago. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-dino-crisis-trademark-revival/">Brazilian filing</a> is particularly interesting, as the series was trademarked again at the same time CAPCOM filed a trademark for Resident Evil Requiem, and with a similar trademark class, entertainment and video games. Hopefully, these trademarks really mean something is in the works for a series that is long overdue its return.</p>



<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, but the classic franchise made a small comeback earlier this year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">GOG release</a> of the first two entries in the series, complete with new features and improvements such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 handheld specifications have leaked online, suggesting the yet-to-be-announced handheld should comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 in certain scenarios.</p>



<p>In a new video shared earlier today on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who has recently proved to be quite reliable regarding PlayStation leaks, revealed some new information on the portable system, which has been obtained via up-to-date documentation. The handheld will be powered by the Canis APU, a monolithic 135mm square die manufactured on a TSMC 3nm node featuring 4 Zen 6c CPU cores and 2 Zen 6 Low Power cores that will run the operating system and all non-gaming tasks with 4MB of L3 for the Zen 6c CCX, a 16 CUs RDNA5 GPU clocked at around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and around 1.65GHz in docked mode and a 192-bit LPDDR5X-8533 memory controller with support to up to 48GB of RAM. Rounding up the features of the handheld are backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, a MicroSD slot, M.2 slot, haptic feedback support, dual mics and a touchscreen.</p>



<p>There is no solid information regarding how much RAM the PlayStation 6 handheld will feature, but it is expected to feature more than 16 or even 24 GB. Asked to comment on the matter, some unspecified developers unanimously agreed that the amounts above wouldn't be enough to run next-generation games with AI features, as even features like UE5's Nanite require a lot of RAM to work properly. As such, these developers believe that anything between 24 and 36 GB of RAM is required for next-gen games.</p>



<p>With these leaked specs seemingly revealed, MLiD also made some performance estimation for the unrevealed PlayStation 6 handheld. Rasterization performance is expected to be between 0.55 and 0.75 times that of the PlayStation 5 in docked mode, while ray tracing performance is between 1.3 and 2.6, which would bring the handheld close to the ray tracing performance of the PlayStation 5 Pro at peak. Factoring in AMD FSR 4 support, the handheld should be able to run patched games at around the PlayStation 5 level of performance, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver mode</a> level with unpatched games. With the faster RDNA5 CUs, which are between 40% and 50% faster than RDNA 3.5 CUs and 60% more bandwidth, the system should also comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>With the specs on hand, MLiD also made some estimations on how much the PlayStation 6 handheld should cost to produce and its final price, which is estimated to be between $399-499, based on the better yields of the TSMC 3nm node, the cost of RAM, compared to previous generation, and the fact that Sony seems to always launch hardware at a loss, although if the estimated costs are correct, Sony would be able to take a small profit even at $399.</p>

<p>As production and release of the PlayStation 6 handheld are expected in 2027, it may be a while until we hear more about the system. Still, we will keep you updated on it as soon as anything comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There is little doubt that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> by Warner Bros. was one of the worst news of the year in the gaming industry, so it's great to learn that Wizards of the Coast has hired a small team of former developers led by Michael de Plater.</p>



<p>Truth be told, de Plater and his colleagues had been working more recently at Cliffhanger Games on the Black Panther game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a few months ago by Electronic Arts</a>. Prior to that, though, they had been at Monolith Productions for a long time. de Plater himself worked on both 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and the sequel, 2017's Middle-earth: Shadow of War. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said:</p>



<p><em>We're super excited to have him as part of the team. We were actually able to bring him and 14 key people that he's worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us. He'll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can't tell you yet. We want to give him time. We'll go through a fairly lengthy concept process where they're going to look at a lot of different ideas.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it will take quite a lot of time before the public gets any info on the new project, but at least we know it's coming. Hight also said it's going to be a fairly similar process to that seen with Stig Asmussen's Giant Skull, although that team hit the ground running and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already making a D&amp;D  action/adventure game</a>.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has <span>been investing heavily in video games lately. About a year ago, then-president Chris Cocks (now CEO at parent company Hasbro)&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-goes-all-in-on-videogames-wants-to-ship-1-2-games-per-year-starting-late-2025-early-2026/" target="_blank">revealed</a>&nbsp;a plan to ship one or two video games each year, starting in&nbsp;</span>late 2025 or early 2026.</p>



<p>Its announced projects, be them internal or external, include <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/">a new D&amp;D game from Invoke Studios</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op D&amp;D game from Starbreeze</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>, the digital tabletop adventure <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEMEO x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: BATTLEMARKED</a>, the aforementioned D&amp;D action/adventure game by Giant Skull, the sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a> in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe game in the making at Atomic Arcade. Another project made at Skeleton Key was reportedly canceled earlier this year.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected.</p>



<p>Here's the whole message that was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.</em></p>



<p><em>To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.</em> <em>To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision.</em></p>



<p>The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP.</p>



<p>In April 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">vague goals to create an interconnected universe</a> that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air on Prime Video</a>.</p>



<p>As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December.</p>
