			<p>As you explore the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Poolside Cave</strong> in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> to help the Roamers complete their trial, you will come across a cryptic riddle in the cave's Underground Level 2 map : <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“A chest that rests in a wintry bath, Will show us the Almighty's path.”</em></p>



<p>While your instinct in any RPG is to open every chest you see, this room is a minefield. Most of the treasure chests here are either completely empty or, far worse, are actually <strong>Canniboxes</strong> in disguise. These monsters are notorious for their high critical hit rate and their ability to cast <strong>Whack</strong> (the series' dreaded instant-death spell).</p>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">In my first playthrough, I learned the hard way that fighting these early on is a recipe for disaster,&nbsp; especially if you're playing at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, so I highly recommend going straight for the&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"wintry bath"&nbsp;</em>and ignoring the decoys.</span></p>

<h3 id="h-finding-the-wintry-bath-chest"><strong>Finding the "Wintry Bath" Chest</strong></h3>



<p>To solve the puzzle and avoid a confrontation with a Cannibox, you need to head to the <strong>eastern side of the map</strong>. You will find a group of <strong>two chests</strong> sitting near a pool of water.</p>

<p>As soon as you interact with it, you will hear a distinct <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">rumbling noise</strong>. This is the signal that the puzzle has been solved and the path forward has opened.</p>

			<p><strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> introduces a level of flexibility never before seen in the series by offering three distinct difficulty presets: <strong>Easy Going</strong>, <strong>Happy Medium</strong>, and <strong>Tough Going</strong>. These roughly correspond to your traditional <em>Easy</em>, <em>Normal</em>, and <em>Hard</em> modes.</p>



<p>While these presets are a good starting point, the "reimagined" experience allows you to adjust every parameter individually, even during the game (<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Main Menu, Settings, Difficulty Level</strong>). After extensive testing, I have found that the default <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Happy Medium</strong> can still feel a bit too simple for both series veterans and those accustomed to RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>To achieve a playthrough that rewards strategy without becoming a tedious grind, I recommend a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Custom Balanced</strong> setup.</p>

<h2 id="h-recommended-balanced-custom-settings">Recommended "Balanced" Custom Settings</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Difficulty-Settings-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The difficulty settings I have used in my first full playthrough of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Setting</strong></td><td><strong>Selection</strong></td><td><strong>Why it Works</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Damage Dealt</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Avoids making enemies feel like "damage sponges."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Experience Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Maintains the game's native progression curve.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proficiency Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Keeps Vocation leveling steady and rewarding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gold Acquired</strong></td><td><strong>More</strong></td><td>Reduces early-game poverty and increases gear options.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Strength</strong></td><td><strong>Strong</strong></td><td><strong>Essential</strong> to keep the Vocation system relevant.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Monsters Attack</strong></td><td>Keeps the tension high during field exploration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Restore HP after Battle</strong></td><td><strong>Don't Restore</strong></td><td>Preserves the classic resource-management loop.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-these-settings">Why These Settings?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-dealt-normal"><strong>Damage Dealt: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>Reducing the damage your party deals has one unfortunate side effect: it prolongs battles with no tangible benefit to strategy.</p>



<p>I tested the difference between <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Normal</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Less</em> damage against two early-game Vicious enemies: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Hammerhood</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ballymolly Region</strong>) and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Bodkin Archer</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Emberdale Region</strong>). There was zero difference in the strategy required; I simply had to spend more turns using <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Healing Herbs</em> to conserve MP. It wasn't more fun—only more tedious.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-amp-proficiency-normal"><strong>Experience &amp; Proficiency: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>The game is already quite generous with <strong>EXP</strong> and <strong>Proficiency Points</strong>. During my testing, I never felt the need to grind, as the game's balance is handled differently than traditional <em>Dragon Quest</em> games. Keeping these at <em>Normal</em> ensures you stay at the intended power level for the story without inadvertently out-leveling the content.</p>



<h3 id="h-gold-acquired-more"><strong>Gold Acquired: More</strong></h3>



<p>This comes down to personal preference, but <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are notoriously stingy with gold. While I understand you aren't meant to buy out every shop immediately, having more financial freedom early on makes the game significantly more enjoyable. It allows you to experiment with different gear setups rather than being locked into a single "optimal" purchase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Boss-Fight-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This difficulty settings made my first playthrough very enjoyable without making the experience overly frustrating</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-monster-strength-strong"><strong>Monster Strength: Strong</strong></h3>



<p>Because <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> is balanced differently than the original PlayStation or 3DS versions, the base game is generally quite easy. Anything lower than <strong>Strong</strong> results in combat encounters becoming a "walk in the park."</p>



<p>If you want to actually engage with the <strong>Vocation System</strong> and avoid steamrolling bosses and Elite enemies, setting Monster Strength to <strong>Strong</strong> is the only way to ensure the game's mechanics actually matter.</p>



<h3 id="h-restore-hp-after-battle-don-t-restore"><strong>Restore HP after Battle: Don't Restore</strong></h3>



<p>Setting this to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Don't Restore</strong> is vital for maintaining the survival aspect that defines the series. When HP is automatically restored, the tension during dungeon exploration completely vanishes, as every individual battle exists in a vacuum.</p>



<p>By keeping this setting <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OFF</strong>, you preserve the classic resource-management loop of the series which forces you to make choices in regards to items and spending MPs to heal your party or save them for other skills.</p>



<h3 id="h-bonus-setting-objective-marker-display-off">Bonus Setting -  Objective Marker Display: Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Objective-Marker-Off-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Turn off the Objective Marker Display to preserve the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined great sense of discovery</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of every <em>Dragon Quest</em> title is the sense of <strong>discovery</strong>. This is even more vital in <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, where the core of the experience is witnessing how the world’s islands have changed between the <em>Past</em> and the <em>Present</em>.</p>



<p>Having the marker constantly active conditions your experience, making it feell like it’s on rails. By turning the marker off (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Main Menu</strong>, then <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">System</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Screen Settings</strong>,) you are encouraged to look around the world map and villages and interact with NPCs, who not only provide the clues you need to progress but also flesh out the world with flavor text and lore. This organic exploration makes the game world feel alive, ultimately making your journey far more enjoyable than simply following an icon on a map.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-results">The Results</h3>



<p>By combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Strong</strong> monsters with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">More</strong> gold, you create a game that is tactically demanding but allows you the resources to meet those challenges. It’s the perfect "Sweet Spot" for your first journey into this beautiful world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although it streamlines many of its most challenging elements to be more welcoming than the PlayStation original, <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> can still be a massive undertaking for newcomers that may have some trouble getting into the game and enjoying it right from the beginning.</p>



<p>To maximize your understanding of the early game, and thus its enjoyment, we have put together a list of beginners' tips that are sure to help you enjoy <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> more, especially if this is your first time putting the fragments of the forgotten past back together again.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere" data-level="2">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</a></li><li><a href="#h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely" data-level="2">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</a></li><li><a href="#h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies" data-level="2">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</a></li><li><a href="#h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day" data-level="2">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</a></li><li><a href="#h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense" data-level="2">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Mini-Medals-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore the world thoroughly to discover all sorts of secrets</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Although the experience has been tweaked to be more welcoming,&nbsp;<em><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong></em>&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>&nbsp;game through and through, which puts the same emphasis on exploration as it does on turn-based combat.</span> As such, <strong>every time</strong> you reach a new island or discover a new village, make absolutely sure to talk to every NPC, search every closet and drawer, and smash every urn and barrel before you do anything else.</p>



<p>This isn't just to discover more gear and items that can make you save some gold and <strong>Mini Medals</strong> (which can be exchanged for rewards in <strong>Estard Castle</strong>), but this is also a tip to enhance your enjoyment of the story. </p>



<p>The true beauty of this game lies in the small details and the connection between the past and the present of an island, which the main story often glosses over, giving you a much deeper connection to the world you are working so hard to restore.</p>



<h2 id="h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Fight-Wisely-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Fight Wisely" is a great auto-battle option to improve combat pacing</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> addresses the high random encounter rate of older games by making enemies visible on the field, you will still be fighting many enemies during your adventure. To make random battles snappier and considerably faster, consider using the <strong>"Fight Wisely"</strong> Tactics option for all your characters, which you can assign at the start of every battle by pressing the <strong>Triangle / Y / X</strong> buttons.</p>



<p>This auto-combat option is based on the principle of taking down enemies as efficiently as possible. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Fight Wisely"</strong> on, characters will also heal when needed using either magic or items, making it a much more reliable option than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Show No Mercy."</strong> During regular combat encounters, however, make sure to <strong>turn off the When Worked Up, Use Let Loose Immediately option</strong> by pressing Triangle / Y / X in the Tactics menu to avoid needlessly wasting the powerful Let Loose skills.</p>



<p>If you wish to speed up battles further, also consider changing the battle speed to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fast</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra Fast</strong>. While combat animations are great to look at, over the dozens of hours it takes to complete the game, they will grow old, believe me.</p>



<h2 id="h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Gold-Sparkle-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Focus on Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies if you are not inclined towards exploring the world to still reap some great benefits</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you're a player who's more inclined towards quick story progression, you may want to reduce your exploration endeavors to just hunting down two specific things: <strong>Gold Sparkles</strong> and elite <strong>"Vicious"</strong> enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gold Sparkles:</strong> As opposed to regular sparkles, these found on the world map hide special items and <strong>won't respawn</strong>. Hidden in them are rare items such as <strong>Seeds</strong> that can be used to boost your characters' stats permanently.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elite "Vicious" Enemies:</strong> These can be recognized by their <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">red glow</strong> and the fact that they don't move around. These more powerful variants can be challenging, but they drop <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hearts,</strong> which can be equipped to customize your characters with very useful passive abilities.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Present-Day-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Exploring the Present Day world carefully is really important in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is a common mistake for players to assume that the "Past" versions of islands are the only places where progress happens. However, you should make it a priority to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore everything in the Present Day</strong> as soon as an island has been restored. Many vital <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Fragments</strong> are tucked away in the modern versions of towns and dungeons.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can find <strong>useful gear</strong> and <strong>learn more about an island's history by speaking with NPCs</strong> when you revisit a location. In my first playthrough, I found that if I ever felt stuck or unable to progress at the Shrine of Mystery, the solution was almost always a missed fragment hidden in the most recently restored "Present" island.</p>



<h2 id="h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Shop-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Always priotize defensive gear to have an easier time throughout the game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When visiting a new shop in any of the game's villages and towns, you might be inclined to spend all your gold on the weapon with the highest attack stat. However, I highly recommend that you <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prioritize purchasing defensive gear first.</strong> In <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, especially at <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, survivability is far more valuable than raw power.</p>



<p>The reason for this is simple: every now and then, you will encounter powerful enemies and bosses that can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">act twice per turn.</strong> A character with a high-damage sword but weak armor can be wiped out in a single turn before your healer even has a chance to react. By focusing on shields, helmets, and armor first, you ensure your party can weather these difficulty spikes. This strategy is crucial for maintaining the game’s pacing and preventing lost progress.</p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has a lot of systems that its players need to be aware of, and while the gear you take with you each time you go <strong>Topside</strong> is important, you also need to be levelling up your Raider's skill tree appropriately, if you want to be able to make the best of your runs.</p>



<p>While completing the full <strong>Skill Tree</strong> is a slog, since you don't just have to unlock skills by spending individual points, you need to spend a certain amount of skill points in each of the three sections (<strong>Conditioning, Mobility,</strong> and <strong>Survival</strong>) to move into the second and third tiers of skills. </p>



<p>That means you don't want to needlessly spend your skill points on skills that won't have as much of an impact on your playing experience. This guide will show you which of the skills in the skill tree are the best in the game, and what you should be focusing on.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-skills-in-arc-raiders-guide">The Best Skills in ARC Raiders - Guide</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The ARC Raiders skill tree.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-conditioning-skills">Best Conditioning Skills</h3>



<p>The <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch of skills is all about keeping your Raider in top shape for the marathon that is going on runs Topside. The skills in this branch help toughen your Raider in bad situations, with some restoring stamina and health while you're low on health, and others that make you more proficient at common elements of the game, like breaching containers and how fast you can be with extra weight on your back. </p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Conditioning branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Used to the Weight</strong> - Wearing a shield doesn't slow you down as much</li>



<li><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> - Breaching doors and containers takes less time</li>



<li><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> - When you're critically hurt, your stamina regenerates faster</li>



<li><strong>Downed but Determined</strong> - When you're downed, it takes longer before you collapse</li>



<li><strong>A Little Bit Extra</strong> - Breaching an object generates resources</li>
</ul>



<p>The first on the list, <strong>Used to the Weight</strong>, is also the first Conditioning skill you'll unlock. Its description (read above) might not sound like a lot on the face of it, but when you consider that you'll be wearing a shield every time you're Topside, you immediately understand why it's essential. So essential that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> put it at the beginning of the branch, to ensure you don't miss it. </p>



<p>When you've unlocked the rest of the skills in the opening tier of the Conditioning branch, and you're looking for skills to dump points into so you can continue to the next tier, Used to the Weight should be one of the first skills you max out.</p>



<p><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong>, <strong>Downed but Determined</strong>, and <strong>A Little Bit Extra </strong>are all fairly self-explanatory in their importance. You're constantly breaching things open to get resources, and you're vulnerable while breaching something. You should work to make this as quick as possible. While Downed but Determined gives you a greater chance at survival if you do go down, with other players having more time to pick you back up. Lastly, A Little Bit Extra is just that - extra resources that can go a long way to making breaching anything and everything worth more.</p>



<p><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> is just as key as actually increasing your max stamina (which we'll get to in the <strong>Mobility </strong>section). You'll find yourself in a lot of tough situations in ARC Raiders. Having your stamina regenerate faster in those situations will help you get out of a lot of jams that would've otherwise killed you.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-mobility-skills">Best Mobility Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Conditioning branch helps keep your Raider in top shape, the <strong>Mobility </strong>branch keeps you nimble and mobile, with skills that directly impact your stamina, both how much you have and how it regenerates, how fast you are, and how far actions like jumping and vaulting can take you.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Mobility branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Youthful Lungs - </strong>Increases your max stamina</li>



<li><strong>Marathon Runner</strong> - Moving around costs less stamina</li>



<li><strong>Calming Stroll</strong> - While walking, your stamina regenerates as if you were standing still</li>



<li><strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> - When you're downed, you crawl faster</li>



<li><strong>Heroic Leap</strong> - You can Sprint Dodge Roll further</li>
</ul>



<p>Like some of the skills in the Conditioning branch, the importance of skills like <strong>Youthful Lungs, Marathon Runner, </strong>and <strong>Calming Stroll</strong> is all pretty self-explanatory. Everything you do impacts your stamina, so levelling up Youthful Stroll to give you more is a no-brainer; the same goes for Marathon Runner to make the stamina you do have go further. Calming Stroll helps you keep that stamina up and ready for when you need it, like being surprised by a Hornet or a Rocketeer you didn't notice was patrolling by, and you accidentally walked right into its sightline.</p>



<p>I can tell you from experience that <strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> (especially when paired with <strong>Downed But Determined</strong>) can be the difference between you making it back to Speranza alive or a failed run. Not successfully extracting stings, and it stings even more if the difference was just a few feet and your Raider's inability to stay alive for a few seconds longer. </p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Heroic Leap</strong> can be an essential skill for combat. As noted in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">Tips and Tricks Guide</a></strong>, plenty of the maps you'll visit in ARC Raiders have a serious lack of cover, and getting caught out in the open without a place to hide or duck behind can mean a resource-draining fight, or worse, the end of your run. Heroic Leap can take you that extra bit to help you stay ahead of ARCs and other players while in combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-survival-skills">Best Survival Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The third and final branch of the skill tree in ARC Raiders, the <strong>Survival</strong> branch, is all about skills that keep your instincts sharp while Topside. Some of that includes skills that impact how much noise you make and how you interact with looting resources, while some of the skills give you additional abilities to use while Topside.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the <strong>Survival </strong>branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>In-Round Crafting - </strong>Unlocks the ability to field-craft items while Topside.</li>



<li><strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> - Increases the maximum weight you can carry.</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Instincts</strong> - When searching a container, loot is revealed faster.</li>



<li><strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> - Your stamina regeneration is less affected by being over-encumbered.</li>



<li><strong>Minesweeper</strong> - Mines and explosives can be defused when in close proximity.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> is an obvious one, because it means you don't have to rely on bringing as many bandages and shield rechargers as you can carry. You'll be able to craft items like those on the fly while Topside, freeing up more space in your backpack for more tactical items. <strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> and <strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> are two skills that work in tandem with each other. One increases your carrying capacity, while the other ensures that even if you go beyond your limits, you won't be impacted as greatly as you could've been.</p>



<p><strong>Minesweeper</strong> is another that's important for obvious reasons, because being able to defuse explosives can help give you the upper hand when fighting enemy Raiders trying to get the jump on you. Lastly, <strong>Looter's Instinct</strong> works in tandem with <strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> from the <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch. Not only will you be faster when it comes to breaching, but Looter's Instinct helps to make the actual looting part as quick as possible, so you're not left vulnerable in the looting menu for longer than you need to be.</p>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>The five skills listed in each section are, in my experience, the best skills to put levels into as soon as you can, and the ones you should focus on unlocking the most. That said, there are a few that I did want to make sure I highlighted, so you don't needlessly ignore them.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sturdy Ankles </strong>(<strong>Mobility</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Luck</strong> (<strong>Survival</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Loaded Arms </strong>(<strong>Conditioning</strong>)</li>
</ul>

As a demanding Unreal Engine 5 game, many PC gamers — on various PC setups, including high-end ones — have unfortunately voiced their frustrations when it comes to the game's performance profile.</p>



<p>This guide should hopefully help you attain an optimal balance between performance and visuals.

<h2 id="h-about-code-vein-ii-a-brief-overview">About Code Vein II — A Brief Overview</h2>



<p>Released on January 29, 2026, on PC (via Steam), <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> is the sequel to Bandai Namco’s anime-inspired action RPG, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/">Code Vein</a></em>, blending stylish characters and high-octane Souls-like combat with an open-world twist. Early reviews praise its combat and world design, but many critics and PC players alike have flagged performance issues even on fairly powerful rigs.</p>

<p>Even with recommended specs, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> can dip below target framerates in open-world and intense combat scenes, thus highlighting the need for extra tuning of the game's graphics settings in order to achieve better performance/visuals ratios.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the game does have a Pipeline State Object (PSO)/shader compilation step, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">which,</strong> in my experience,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> was quite effective as I failed to spot a single instance of shader compilation stutter</strong>.

<h2 id="h-graphics-settings-breakdown-visuals-vs-performance"><strong>Graphics Settings Breakdown — Visuals vs Performance</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we will explore the various graphics settings in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II, </em>via comparison videos that should show case both the graphics and performance (in terms of FPS) of each setting, thus allowing us to determine which settings strike the best visuals/performance balance, which is the basis for establishing optimized graphical settings in this game, or any other game for that matter.</p>



<p>Also, please be aware of the fact that the graphics settings comparisons in this section have all been made on a system with the following specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-14700K;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM:</strong> 32 GB DDR5-7000 CL34;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Storage:</strong> 2 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Operating System:</strong> Windows 11 25H2;</li>



<li>All system firmware, drivers, BIOS, and OS updates were fully applied before testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Also, all of the comparisons were done under <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU limited scenarios at a resolution of 2560x1440 (1440p) with TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) as the temporal upscaling solution at the native resolution (100% render scale)</strong>, as in this game — like most other Unreal Engine 5 games — the GPU will largely be the performance limiting factor rather than the CPU (or other system components), unless you were aiming to achieve some really high framerates. Furthermore, please be aware of the fact that lowering GPU-intensive graphics settings (which are basically all of the following settings) will not affect a game's performance if the rest of your system (mainly CPU and system memory) is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> too slow to keep up with your GPU</strong>.</p>



<p>First of all, let's take a look at the game's graphics setting menu, with all of its subsections:</p>


<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part 1</em></figcaption></figure>
</p>

<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part </em>2</figcaption></figure>
</p>

<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-3.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part </em>3</figcaption></figure>
</p>


<p>We can see that the game supports all major temporal upscaling solutions, <strong>with the exception of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-3-mfg-multi-frame-gen-up-to-4x-mode-unveiled-coming-to-all-arc-gpus/">Intel's XeSS</a></strong>. Unfortunately, we can also see that <strong>the game supports no frame generation technologies</strong>, which would've been useful to further increase the game's smoothness, albeit at the cost of potential visual artifacts and higher latency.</p>



<p>Another thing that's worth mentioning is that in the following comparisons, you might sometimes spot differences in lighting that go beyond changing the relevant graphics setting. This is unfortunately due to the fact that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the game has a rapidly changing dynamic weather system</strong>, which makes it really difficult to capture completely like-for-like scenes in video format at different time frames.</p>



<p>With that said, let us finally delve into the visuals/performance profile of each relevant graphics setting that the game offers.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Note</strong>: The comparison videos have a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to-set-up-high-quality-performance-overlays-with-rtss/">CapFrameX/RTSS based overlay</a> that contains performance data regarding two metrics that we feel are relevant to gauge the performance profile of each graphics setting, which <span>are<strong>&nbsp;real-time</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> framerate (FPS)</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dedicated GPU memory (VRAM) usage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-draw-distance"><strong>Draw Distance</strong></h3>

</p></figure>



<p>We can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Draw Distance</strong>" setting seems to control the distance at which various game assets <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> such as rocks, pebbles, and foliage <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> are drawn on the screen. We can also see that the various levels of this setting don't really affect performance much differently, and that the two lowest settings especially exhibit noticeable pop-in of certain assets in the ground. <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Therefore, we recommend using the "Farthest" level for this setting</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-anti-aliasing-processing-and-render-scaling-aka-temporal-upscalers"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong> <strong>(AKA Temporal Upscalers)</strong></h3>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong>" settings are intricately linked with each other, as the former setting controls the type of temporal upscaling/anti-aliasing solution to tackle the game's aliasing and/or to also upscale a lower-resolution input into a higher-resolution one, and the latter setting controls the per-resolution axis upscaling factor (in terms of percentages from 40% to 100%). <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Our recommendations for this setting simply depend on your GPU vendor</strong>: NVIDIA GPU users should obviously use <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/">DLSS Super Resolution</a>, whereas both AMD <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> except AMD RDNA4 users who may be able to utilize the way more advanced FSR 4 upscaling via the AMD Adrenalin GPU driver interface <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and Intel GPU users should simply avoid FSR (version 3.1) upscaling at all costs <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> given its incredibly soft and shimmery output <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and instead use Unreal Engine 5's included TSR (Temporal Super Resolution), whose quality and performance impact can be controlled from the Anti-Aliasing setting, which we shall see a bit further down.</p>

<p>This setting controls the quality of Unreal Engine 5's TSR, and given the fact that there aren't any major differences in visual quality between the different levels on display here, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">we recommend that users stick with the "Medium" setting</strong>, as a safe and balanced option when it comes to its performance/visuals balance.</p>



<h3 id="h-shadow"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Shadow</strong></h3>

</p></figure>



<p>We recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" shadow quality setting, as in our opinion, it strikes the best visuals/performance ratio out of all levels on display in the above video. However, should players encounter distracting shadow flickering — especially in some tree/foliage heavy areas of the game — then we recommend that they bump it up to the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">High</strong>" level, and avoid the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highest</strong>" level unless they have a lot of GPU horsepower to spare.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>For the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Texture</strong>" setting, we simply did not observe any differences in both performance and texture quality of some game assets, like rocks and walls. This is perhaps reflected in the fact that the GPU dedicated VRAM usage meter doesn't really seem to differ between all levels of the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Texture</strong>" setting. However, since the game was allocating <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least</em> 8 GB of GPU memory at 1440p on our RTX 4090 GPU, we <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">recommend that people not play this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> at least at this resolution or higher <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> on GPUs with less than 8 GB of VRAM, </strong>lest they encounter increased stuttering and hitching due to insufficient video memory capacity.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Effects</strong>" setting seems to control the quality of special effects such as GPU-accelerated particles and certain transparencies. From the performance/visuals ratio of each level of this setting, we can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Medium</strong>" level should be adequate for most people looking to strike a decent balance in both visuals and performance.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Material</strong>" graphics setting is a bit of an odd one, and one we think is sadly poorly explained by the game developers. We think it controls the quality of specular highlights and reflections, and it seems that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Low</strong>" level performs clearly better than the higher levels. However, in rainy weather, the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Low</strong>" level simply destroys the specular highlights of various game assets, such as rocks and characters. The "High" setting obviously has the highest visual quality, though it also comes at a performance cost. Therefore, we recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" level of this setting.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Character Model</strong>" setting doesn't seem to make a difference in either performance or character rendering fidelity in our testing. Consequently, <strong>we recommend that players just use the "High" level of this setting</strong>.</p>



<p>Wrapping it all up, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">here are the final, recommended optimized graphics settings</strong> for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Code Vein II</em>, which we feel strike an optimal point in the realm of performance/visuals trade-offs:</p>

<p>You can further improve your <em>Code Vein II</em> performance <strong>by combining both optimized graphics settings and temporal upscaling from a lower input resolution</strong>, not to mention that <strong>you could also overclock your GPU to further boost your framerates and frametime consistency</strong>. Just make sure that your overclock is fully stable!</p>

<p>And if that still isn't enough for you, then you could further improve the game's visual smoothness <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> at the cost of extra latency and potentially visible visual artifacts, especially at low base framerates <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">by enabling FSR Frame Generation</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> or even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/latest-intel-arc-graphics-driver-introduces-xess-3-multi-frame-generation-support/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">XeSS Frame Generation</strong></a> in the case of Optiscaler <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em>, either <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/codevein2/mods/19?tab=description"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">via this mod</strong></a> or with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/heres-how-to-add-amd-fsr-redstone-frame-gen-to-almost-any-game-using-optiscaler/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Optiscaler</strong></a>. You could also use GPU driver frame generation/interpolation technologies, such as NVIDIA Smooth Motion or AMD Advanced Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) 2.1, if the aforementioned methods aren't viable for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-words"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Words</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> did not impress us with its ratio of visual fidelity and performance. Even among the slew of many dozen Unreal Engine 5 games that are available on both consoles and PC, the game simply fails to achieve a satisfying balance between performance and visuals, and is therefore in need of multiple updates to further improve its performance. The lack of XeSS upscaling and frame generation technologies is also a sore technical point in the delivered package.</p>



<p id="h-">Still, with smart tweaking of individual graphics settings (including temporal upscaling), you can achieve a somewhat decent experience in this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> especially if your hardware is up to snuff <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em>, as fully maxed-out visuals often come at an unnecessarily steep performance cost that's well within diminishing returns in terms of extra visual flair. It’s a balancing act worth mastering for the best experience, at least in our opinion.</p>
