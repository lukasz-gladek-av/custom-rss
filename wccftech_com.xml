			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for Splatoon 3 cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation Gets Added to Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, MECHA BREAK, Rematch, and Dragonkin: The Banished]]></title>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been added to even more PC games, providing accelerated frame rates to owners of RTX graphics cards, depending on their GPU. Users equipped with the RTX 20 or 30 Series can enable DLSS Super Resolution, those with an RTX 40 Series graphics card can add DLSS Frame Generation, and the lucky few who have purchased a shiny new RTX 50 GPU can boost frame rates even further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>One of those games is Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The game already supported DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and several ray traced effects when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on PC earlier this year. Now, an update has added Multi Frame Generation, allowing RTX 50 Series users an average boost of 4.9x at 4K resolution with all settings maxed out, ray tracing included. The GeForce RTX 5090 runs the game at 256.5 FPS, the RTX 5080 reaches 209.5 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti averages 184.9 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Similarly, the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> three months ago in early access with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With a new update, the game now supports Multi Frame Generation, and the NVIDIA app allows RTX users to activate the override to the improved NVIDIA DLSS 4 transformer AI model for better visual quality.</p>
<p>Today is release day for two highly anticipated PC games. One of them is Funcom's Dune: Awakening, which debuted last week for those who had purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate editions, but kicks off for everyone today. The massive survival sandbox multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-boosts-performance-by-an-average-of-4-9x-in-dune-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex, as well as the aforementioned transformer AI model override via the NVIDIA app. Just like in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the average performance uplift is 4.9x. The GeForce RTX 5090 averages 338 frames per second, and even the GeForce RTX 5070 is practically at 200 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other game due to launch today is Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-pc-system-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>, which also includes all the above plus NVIDIA DLAA. Looking ahead, June 12 will mark the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade on PC.</a> Shift Up's acclaimed action game also supports all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies, providing an average 3.4x performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, goes up to 540 frames per second, while both the RTX 5080 and the RTX 5070 Ti surpass 300 frames per second, and the RTX 5070 reaches 260 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Next week, Sloclap is going to release the arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REMATCH</a>. This isn't a particularly taxing game, but you'll still be able to turn on NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex to maximize your experience when the game launches on June 19.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye | 4K DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot_ZpJYyLGc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On July 1, the multiplayer action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a> will make its debut with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. Lastly, The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be releasing on September 4) will still feature the full RTX suite (DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing) just like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base game</a>. Unfortunately, NVIDIA did not mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair update</a> that was supposed to be released a while ago but never materialized.</p>

			<p>Apple <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-announces-ios-26-with-new-glass-dsign-updated-features-more/">unveiled</a> its new Liquid Glass redesign for its entire product line, and to be fair, the updates are quite significant, not just when it comes to looks but functionality as well. While the design of iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 is pretty neat that takes into account different layers of digital glass that refract light differently, it would be unfair to point out that Windows did it first. Moreover, Samsung wasted no time in reminding Apple that it, too, had already used glass in its UI.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Liquid Glass UI for iOS 26, macOS Tahoe faces Samsung, Windows jabs over design originality, AI features</h2>
<p>Samsung has always stood on top when it comes to poking Apple for its design, whether its hardware or software, and iOS 26 is no exception. The Cupertino tech giant calls its new 'Liquid Glass' UI design language 'expressive,' which sounds a bit too familiar, as Google recently announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-releases-android-16-qpr1-beta-1-for-pixel/">Material 3 Expressive design</a> for Android 16, which kind of follows the same glass approach. Samsung was quick to notice and posted its insights mockingly on X.</p>
<p>The South Korean giant first poked fun at the "sleek glass UI" of iOS 26 by referencing its own One UI 7 redesign. One UI 7 is pretty reminiscent in this regard, and while the approach and mechanics behind the design could be different, the general visuals appear to be pretty similar.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customizable apps? Floating bars? That sleek glass UI? Looks… familiar 🤔</p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932126084641718633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Samsung stated that its One UI 7 update launched with some of Apple's new AI features first, including Live Translations across Messages, FaceTime, and the Phone apps. This feature was introduced with the Galaxy S24 lineup last year, and now they are available on additional devices. Samsung also took a dig at Apple for just adding AI features to the Apple Watch, like Workout Buddy and other minor additions. Samsung says that it has used AI on its Galaxy Watch models for a while, and while it is not something to brag about, the company is the first to adopt the technology.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New to live translations? Welcome aboard! We’ve been translating text and speech in real-time for a while now… <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932130403726590361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI is coming to your watch? Cute. Ours already knows when you’re too tired to care 😴 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932135428410196118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Samsung may have used AI and glass UI in its products first, but Apple's implementation is quite different, and the usability might vary as well. If you think this is it, <a href="https://wccftech.com/macos-tahoe-brings-liquid-glass-ui-new-spotlight-games-app-more/">macOS Tahoe 26</a> has also been mocked for its Windows Vista-like design language.</p>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/10/apple-innovates-windows-vista-aero-glass-with-macos-26-liquid-glass-oh-well/">Windows Latest</a></em>, macOS Tahoe 26 and Windows Vista share various similarities, not just the visuals. Apple says the macOS Tahoe “is crafted with Liquid Glass, a translucent new material that reflects and refracts its surroundings.” On the flip side, Microsoft describes Aero Glass in Windows Vista as "providing spectacular visual effects such as glass-like interface elements that you can see through.”</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The publication also states that macOS Tahoe uses soft tints and depth layers for folders and apps, which is pretty similar to how Vista worked with color-based transparency effects. You can read the full piece for more details on the design of both software updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There is no first-mover advantage when it comes to design; it just looks good and is totally up to the user how he sees it. Apple's rendition is neat and new for the company and its user base, which makes all the difference. How did you like the new Liquid Glass redesign? Let us know in the comments.</p>
