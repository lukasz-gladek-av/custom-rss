			<p>It has been confirmed that AMD FSR 4, in its complete implementation, will be available to PS5 Pro developers starting next year. This isn't surprising, considering that Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/">helped</a> AMD develop the algorithm as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/">Project Amethyst.</a></p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 will be available as an upgrade to the existing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), which debuted with the PS5 Pro launch in late 2024. In an interview <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Tom's Guide</a>, Sony Lead System Architect Mark Cerny explained:</p>



<p><em>The algorithm they came up with could be implemented on current-generation hardware. So, the co-developed algorithm has already been released by AMD as part of FSR 4 on PC. And we're in the process of implementing it on PS5, and it will release next year on PS5 Pro. It's not a cut-down version of the algorithm. It's the full-fat version of the co-developed super resolution that we'll be releasing on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>Commenting on the ongoing Project Amethyst partnership with AMD, Cerny added:</p>



<p><em>This is not for proprietary technology. This is really trying to move the industry forward. Obviously, we want to use these technologies on our consoles, but these technologies are available to any of AMD's customers freely. Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of the engineering I am doing on the project. And again, this is coming out of trying to move things forward. There are no restrictions on the way any of it can be used. AMD is moving extremely quickly. What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my time frame is multi-year here.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the article shares a comment where both companies hint at an even tighter partnership than during the design of the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>This comes just days after AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">announced</a> a multi-year partnership with Microsoft. However, that one seems focused on making various types of Xbox devices, including the upcoming ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handheld. In contrast, the Sony partnership is centered on machine learning powered upscaling advancements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides completing deliveries and knitting back together a world that a cataclysmic event has torn apart, a big part of the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach experience is to collaborate with other players to build back the infrastructures that have been destroyed by the Death Stranding, and make it easier to complete deliveries and bring the world back together again under the Chiral Network. Doing so, however, can be a very time-consuming endeavor: to bring back roads and monorails, you will have to donate a lot of materials such as Chiral Crystals, Metals, and Ceramics, which can be sometimes hard to get, especially in the quantities required to bring these fundamental infrastructures back. Raiding enemy camps is a good way to collect some resources, but alas, it will still take some time to get everything you need.</p>



<p>There is a way, however, to restore roads and monorails in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more quickly. To take advantage of this trick, however, you will have to play through the story until you complete <strong>Order 12 and unlock fast travel</strong> via the DHV Magellan. This will allow you to travel quickly to any zone deemed safe, including the cities and shelters you have connected to the Chiral Network in Mexico.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you likely have noticed at this point in the game, in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <strong>you can take as much materials as you can carry from any city or shelter</strong>. As you are unlikely to return to Mexico after you are done with the beinning of the game, unless you want to max out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-what-do-you-get-for-maxing-connection-level/">Connection Level</a>, you can <strong>take the materials at your disposal in each city and shelter in Mexico, load them up on the DHV Magellan and bring them to Australia to put them to good use restoring roads and monorails</strong> without having to deal with a material shortage when crafting weapons and tools, as most of your in-game time is spent in Australia.</p>



<p>The process to put this trick into action is simple. Head into any city or shelter in Mexico, access the main terminal, enter the Fabrication and Management menu, and then pick the Claim Materials option. Select any material you want, load them up on your Floating Carrier or any vehicles you have in the vicinity, then head back into the DHV Magellan and add the Materials to its storage. Fast travel to the location nearest to the road or monorail you want to restore, claim the Materials back, load them up and then head to the infrastucture to donate them.</p>



<p>While this trick somewhat defeats the purpose of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, it's still an excellent way to make one of the most tedious mechanics of the game more bearable. All the Materials you can get from Mexico won't be enough to restore every infrastrure in Australia, but they will provide you with a strong start that will make gathering the remaining materials needed far less time-consuming.</p>

			<p>Outriders 2 is one of the two games People Can Fly canceled this year, but the game's development was far from completion.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outriders-2-cancelled/">report</a> shared online, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson corroborated a report from TheThumbWars, confirming that what would have been the second entry in the series was indeed the canceled project codenamed Gemini. However, the game development was far from release, as screenshots and footage provided to Insider Gaming confirmed it wasn't near completion. Reportedly, the game was in motion capture stage earlier this year.</p>



<p>Outriders 2 / Project Gemini was confirmed to have been canceled last month by People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski. The development of the game was suspended due to publisher Square Enix failing to present the developer a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on the project, and the lack of communication regarding its willingness to continue or terminate the development of the project.</p>



<p>Though Outriders 2 and Project Bifrost were cancelled, People Can Fly still has some projects in the works. Besides working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/">Gears of War: E-Day </a>for Microsoft, the studio is also working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/"> yet-to-be-announced game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>

			<p>CAPCOM's focus on the PC market seems to be paying off well, as the Japanese publisher reported a significant increase of its Steam revenue for the previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-sees-61-surge-in-revenue-from-steam-playstation-revenue-decreases/">Automaton</a> today, the Japanese publisher recently confirmed that their Steam revenue for the April 2024 - March 2025 fiscal year increased by 61.1% over the previous fiscal year, roughly $366 million USD. This accounts for 31% of CAPCOM's total revenue, which includes revenue for other businesses, around 10% increase over the previous fiscal year. Looking at the digital entertainment business alone, Steam revenues account for 42.1% of revenue.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM's Steam revenues increasing, it's no surprise that PlayStation sales have become a smaller part of the publisher's revenue. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, PlayStation sales accounted for less than 10% of the company's total revenues.</p>



<p>CAPCOM's success on the PC market doesn't come as a surprise, especially as the publisher has been focusing more and more on it in the recent past. Earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds' PC release marked the first simultaneous multiplatform release for the series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">more than half of the game's total launch window sales were on Steam</a>. Other games from the publisher, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Figther 6</a>, continue to be extremely popular on PC as well, suggesting how the publisher is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future, for the joy of PC players who won't have to wait for any console-exclusivity deal to end to be able to play games from the publisher.</p>
