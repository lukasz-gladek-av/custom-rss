			<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>, Ubisoft Mainz has released the first gameplay showcase for Anno 117: Pax Romana. The video is accompanied by a narrating voice that describes the player's journey throughout the upcoming real-time strategy/city-building game:</p>
<p><em>Latium is where your journey begins, young governor. First, lay down roads to keep your people connected. Organic layouts add charm, while efficient grids boost productivity. Start with dirt roads. They may be humble, but they're the first step on the path to greatness.</em></p>
<p><em>Resources are your lifeblood. Wood from the untouched forests will be essential, but manage your lumber camps wisely to maintain a sustainable supply. And remember, efficient logistics are key.</em><br>
<em>Warehouses will keep goods flowing and production smooth.</em></p>
<p><em>Your residents need more than just work. They need homes. Build neighborhoods that suit your city's vision. Markets drive income and population growth, while taverns keep spirits high.</em><br>
<em>And mind the fire hazards, especially the bakeries. Fires are practically a Roman tradition.</em><br>
<em>Just be mindful of your city's layout. </em></p>
<p><em>Residents will love lavender's sweet scent, but they won't be so fond of the pig farm's stench. Balance charm and profit wisely. An Anno 117: Pax Romana governor must also live among the people. Establish your own villa as a sign of stability and leadership. Meet your people's needs</em><br>
<em>and they'll advance, unlocking new industries and opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>A resilient economy is vital. Stockpile resources and prepare for challenges, as not every island will yield the goods you desire. Trade is key to securing essential items, but keep an eye on rival governors. Not all share your vision of cooperation. Diplomacy may seem wise, but some rivals favor force. Protect your trade routes with armed escorts and fortified ports. And beware of pirates. A well-defended harbor keeps your goods safe from thieving hands.</em></p>
<p><em>As your city in Anno 117: Pax Romana prospers, your people's desires grow. Fine goods, entertainment, and culture become their demands. Libraries and grammaticus schools pave the way for technological advancements. Public service buildings like bathhouses boost health, while theaters keep happiness high. Grand monuments, like the Colosseum, bring prestige and secure the emperor's favor. Never underestimate the power of reputation. After all, it's the key to lasting legacy.</em></p>
<p><em>Faith unites your people and strengthens your leadership. Each island may dedicate itself</em><br>
<em>to a single deity, but shrines for other gods are welcome. Believing in Neptune grants faster ships</em><br>
<em>and bountiful sea production, while believing in Mars empowers your soldiers and bolsters your army's morale. Choose your patron god wisely, as faith will shape your province's destiny.</em></p>
<p><em>Expand through diplomacy or force. The choice is yours. Trade and alliances can build</em><br>
<em>a sprawling network, but conquest secures your rule. Aqueducts fuel growth while fortresses guard your borders. Prepare your military to defend your ambitions. Whether close combat or long-range firepower, your strategy will determine your legacy.</em></p>
<p><em>Your rule may extend to lands beyond the empire, like Albion, where Celts resist Roman influence. It's a wild place. Will you protect Celtic traditions or remain loyal to Roman ambition? Your choices will determine your fate: a prosperous metropolis, or a city in bankruptcy?</em></p>

<p>It's been six years since the previous franchise installment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/anno-1800-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anno 1800</a>. This time, players are going to the earliest historical setting of any Anno game thus far, dating back to the Pax Romana, a time when peace reigned and the economy thrived in the Roman Empire. The developers have claimed that the new game will retain the series' trademark complexity while making things easier for newcomers.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana will debut later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>One of the more surprising Nintendo Switch 2 features added to the new console is undoubtedly GameChat. Historically, Nintendo never put a lot of its focus on online communication between players, but this feature is looking to change that in a major way, allowing users to chat, share screens, and even share video (with the dedicated camera, purchased separately from the console).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 GameChat was designed partly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as confirmed by console producer Kouichi Kawamoto <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an official developer interview</a>:</p>
<p><em>Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time. So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to the Nintendo Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.</em></p>
<p>Now, we've learned that GameChat will also support live subtitles (it will transcribe what everyone is saying) and text-to-speech, which is great news as those are excellent accessibility options to have. You can check out those features in action below.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/app.bsky.feed.post/3lpevyywrvw2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreib7bn352szlugn7q2nbxwjjulaqbfgt7smjji4hew4jnohedcsace">
<p>[Switch 2]GameChat supports live subtitles. The system can transcribe what everyone is saying and display it in a "chat box" on screen.</p>

<p>[Switch 2]GameChat supports text-to-speech. If enabled, you can type in text and the system will read it for you.While not explicitly confirmed, USB keyboards should be supported too (the Switch 1 already supports them for text input).</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k?ref_src=embed">OatmealDome (@oatmealdome.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/post/3lpcewgnfao2p?ref_src=embed">2025-05-16T15:49:03.5157015Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, there's a high chance those will only be available as long as you have access to GameChat. As a reminder, the voice communication (activated when you press the new C button on the Joy-Con 2 controller) will only be free to use until March 31, 2026; after that date, it will remain available to active Nintendo Switch Online membership subscribers.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a couple of weeks away from its launch. Keep in mind, though, that Nintendo isn't planning to allow pre-release reviews due to a day-one patch issue. As such, you might have to wait until later in June to get our opinion on the new console.</p>

			<p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is undoubtedly a very busy person these days. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNtAhRQNfcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, the acclaimed game designer and writer revealed he is producing an unannounced game.</p>
<p><em>Then, you know, there's another game that's being worked out in Naughty Dog where I'm more of a producer role and I get to mentor and watch this other team and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that is in addition to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which he's personally directing. And he's also an executive producer and episode director on The Last of Us HBO show, which is likely to continue beyond season two, given that it didn't include all of the story from the second game.</p>
<p>Druckmann's statement confirms a recent rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by movie insider Daniel Richtman, who mentioned that Naughty Dog recently canceled a game formerly directed by Vinit Agarwal but still has another active project that's been in the works for at least three years with Shaun Escayg as its director.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to what that will be, we inevitably enter guessing territory. The mind immediately goes to The Last of Us Part III, which many fans would like to see at some point. However, Druckmann himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-could-be-it-for-the-last-of-us-says-series-creator-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> just over two months ago that there may not even be a third installment in the beloved franchise. Was he just misdirecting until a proper announcement? Or is Escayg perhaps working on a new installment in the Uncharted IP, which is familiar ground for him, having already co-directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy with Kurt Margenau? It may be a while until we learn the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>During that podcast conversation, Druckmann also marveled at the improvements made in the gaming medium when discussing things that The Last of Us fans preferred in the game over the TV show adaptation:</p>
<p><em>Lately, I've just been really fascinated with the adaptation and all the various reactions to it. And I just had this moment the other day where I was reading something, actually people were critical of some choices that we've made in the show and they were saying like, oh, I like this better in the game and this was more subtle in the game, and I just had this joyous moment of like, look how far games have come that we could have this conversation. You can compare the two and the game can sit side by side with an HBO show and you can have this conversation and even if people are critical of it, I just love it. And then there's people that love it and there's people that love the show better, and they're like, "Oh, these choices were better than the game." And I'm like, "Isn't that fascinating? Look at that."</em></p>
