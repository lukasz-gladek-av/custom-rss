			<p>Only a short time after the third installment's tenth anniversary, yesterday was a great day for The Witcher fans as CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the stage</a> during the State of Unreal presentation in Orlando, Florida. The footage included a live demo of sorts, but a CD Projekt RED spokesperson <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/witcher-4-tech-demo-shows-the-game-running-at-60-fps-with-ray-tracing-on-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to VideoGamesChronicle that it should not be confused with The Witcher 4 gameplay.</p>
<p><em>This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology powering The Witcher 4 – but not The Witcher 4 itself. It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech, like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer, and FastGeo Streaming, that are helping shape the future of The Witcher.</em></p>
<p>This is perhaps unsurprising, given that the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that The Witcher 4 won't be released before 2027. As such, it's a little too early to see actual gameplay.</p>
<p>The Polish developer had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its decision to switch from their proprietary RED Engine to Unreal Engine 5 back in 2022. Since the beginning, the claim was that CDPR would help improve the open world game development experience even for other developers. Indeed, what we saw yesterday was impressive, especially considering that the footage was captured on a base PlayStation 5 console that ran the demo at 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<p>On another note, some fans thought that Ciri looked a bit different in the new video compared to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2024</a>. Again, a CDPR spokesperson addressed this feedback in a quote <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided to Kotaku</a>:</p>
<p><em>It’s the same character model used in the 2024 trailer. Ciri’s face is a direct copy of The Witcher 3 model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.</em></p>
<p>During the State of Unreal presentation, Epic Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the public availability of Unreal Engine 5.6, which brings several enhancements for developers.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fallout-76/">Fallout 76</a> free update called Gone Fission is now live, introducing a slew of new features marking the beginning of Season 21.</p>
<p>The biggest feature introduced to the game by the Gone Fission update is fishing, which can be done in any water where swimming is possible. 30 new fish can now be caught, and it is also possible to cook new recipes using them. Before you can start enjoying this new pastime in the world of Fallout 76, however, you will first have to complete the Casting Off new questline, where you will receive a working Fishing Rod, which can also be upgraded by completing the new fishing challenges and daily fishing quests.</p>
<p>The Fallout 76: Gone Fission update also introduces 12 Axolotls to find, one available to catch every month throughout the year. The update also introduces Local Legends, new C.A.M.P. items related to the newly introduced fishing challenges, some combat changes, perk tweaks and rebalancing, and more. You can catch the full update notes <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2fsxzAz2icHeeJYGR37kQs/fallout-76-gone-fission-release-notes">here</a> and check out a quick overview of the new content introduced by the latest update in the trailer below.</p>

			<p>The long-rumored Final Fantasy Tactics remaster could be announced during today's PlayStation State of Play, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement of the new presentation that will air later today, as reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-might-be-teasing-an-upcoming-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-announcement-plus-yasumi-matsuno-retweeted-the-state-of-play-tweet.1206009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Yasumi Matsuno, director and writer of the game, retweeted the announcement, suggesting that something he has worked on would be shown during the presentation, later deleting the retweet. In addition, well-known reporter Jason Schreier talked about the game shortly after the announcement of the State of Play on Bluesky, later correcting a user talking about a remake, saying that it is a remaster.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqptcfid4c2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicz34dptjn7tp7r33oawxpzgbatmfnsp2gs4kikci4fu3zlx66wrq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system">
<p lang="en">Remaster</p>
<p>— Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lqptcfid4c2r?ref_src=embed">June 3, 2025 at 7:36 PM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster has been rumored for a long time, and there's very little doubt that it is real and coming at some point. The game was originally revealed alongside a slew of other Square Enix projects via a massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">GeForce NOW leak</a>, and every leaked title from the publisher eventually turned out to be real, except for the Final Fantasy IX remake, which has yet to be announced, much like the Final Fantasy Tactics Remaster.</p>
<p>Despite rumors of its development making the rounds for years, we have no idea if the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster will be a simple remaster, or something in the vein of Tactics Ogre Reborn, which introduced a lot of gameplay changes that ultimately make the remaster a more enjoyable experience than the PSP release, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">review</a>. Hopefully, it won't take too long to learn more about this, and if one infamous character will end up making every other unit obsolete when he joins Ramza in his quest as he does in the original PlayStation release.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Hotfix Display Driver (version 576.66). This hotfix resolves crashing issues in popular games that are already out, such as the football game EA Sports FC 25 and the turn-based JRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, as well as the upcoming survival MMO-like game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a>, which will officially launch on June 10 but will be playable starting tomorrow for those who purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.</p>
<p>There are a couple more things in this GeForce Hotfix Display Driver release, as you can read from the official changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening may crash during gameplay [5273568]</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 may crash during gameplay [5251937]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Dragons Dogma 2 displays shadow flicker [5252205]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Video playback in a web browser may show brief red/green flash corruption [5241341]</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may crash [5283401]</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike regular GeForce Game Ready drivers, a GeForce Hotfix Display Driver cannot be downloaded via GeForce Experience or the recently released NVIDIA app. You'll have to get it manually <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from this support page on NVIDIA's website</a>. Of course, if you're not encountering those issues and/or are not playing those games, you can skip the download. It will be rolled into the next major GeForce Game Ready driver release anyway, which is probably not far off.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now available, bringing a small number of improvements to the system.</p>
<p>As a minor update, system software 25.04-11.40.00 doesn't introduce any major new features, focusing on improving message and usability on some screens, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official update notes</a> shared on the PlayStation official website. No other change or improvement is mentioned, so we will have to wait for the next update for the usual<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-01-10-60-00/"> system stability improvements</a> often implemented in system software updates.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update went live back in April, bringing back the beloved PlayStation 30th anniversary UI some months after it went live and was later taken down when the 30th anniversary celebrations ended. The 25.03-11.20.00 also introduced the Audio Focus feature, a feature only available when using headphones that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet sounds and voice chat more clearly in games. Rounding up the changes and improvements introduced in the latest major update were the usual system software performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update 25.04-11.40.00 will be downloaded by the system automatically.&nbsp;<span>You can download the latest system software update&nbsp;<a href="https://pc.ps5.update.playstation.net/update/ps5/official/tJMRE80IbXnE9YuG0jzTXgKEjIMoabr6/image/2025_0529/sys_c81ab2031ccdaec9c83dcb1918d5051e3c6e988a5c6dba135cf238aa944072ed/PS5UPDATE.PUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>if you want to update it manually</span>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to insider Tom Henderson, Sony might announce a new God of War game later today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play live stream</a>. However, this won't be the next installment in the main series; on the other hand, the report says it will be a 2.5D Metroidvania-inspired game set in ancient Greece. Henderson even added that it sounds smaller scale than he previously thought, so don't expect a sizable experience.</p>
<p>Still, it could be an interesting one, not unlike Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. That game was successful among critics (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score here on Wccftech) and fans, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not sell enough to warrant a sequel.</a> In the case of God of War, it might be a stopgap release while Sony Santa Monica is busy with something else.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they have two main teams, and their next release from Cory Barlog's team is <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be a new IP, possibly set in a sci-fi universe. Of course, there will eventually be a new mainline God of War game, but it wouldn't be too surprising if it only arrived on PlayStation 6, given the increasingly long development times of a triple-A game.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Sony Santa Monica would be remastering the Greek trilogy. It is unclear whether that was indeed true and the announcement has been delayed, or perhaps insiders got slightly misleading information and their sources were referring to this 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off instead. Regardless, we should learn more about it in around twelve hours or so.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the developer is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> with Amazon Prime Video on a live action TV series adaptation of the Norse trilogy. However, production was delayed due to a major change: showrunner Rafe Judkins was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ronald D. Moore, who is credited for Star Trek: Next Generation, Battlestar Galactica, For All Mankind, and Outlander.</p>

			<p>British developer Jagex announced a round of layoffs. Community Manager JagexHooli <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1l1fut4/comment/mvkxroe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it earlier this week with the following Reddit comment:</p>
<p><em>Yes, there have unfortunately been job reductions at Jagex. These have been made as part of changes in a company restructure as Jagex puts more emphasis on RuneScape games and community growth. The majority of roles are from non-game dev and non-player facing areas. There are some exceptions within the RS team as part the company's focus on a streamlined development approach.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure many of you are concerned about what this means for RuneScape 3. This is not a change in direction from what Mod North has said before – we are still committed to growing this game and investing in it. Our Roadmap won’t change because of these job reductions, and we’ll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content. We will talk to you about this when the time is right.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters most right now are the people affected by this change. The studio’s focus is to support those affected, as is mine. Now is the time we put them first and do everything we can to help them out.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, work on 'Project Zanaris', whose objective was to allow private servers for Old School RuneScape, has been paused. On this note, Jagex <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/pausing-project-zanaris--whats-next?oldschool=1#_ga=2.197087977.499468828.1749024097-1248850839.1749024095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely. We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.</em></p>
<p>Jagex recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a survival cooperative multiplayer game, on Steam Early Access. According to Steam data, it was purchased by 550K, 789K, or 842K users, depending on the analytics website (VG Insights, Gamalytic, PlayTracker).</p>
