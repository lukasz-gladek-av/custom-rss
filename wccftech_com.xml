			<p>Today, CCP Games shared their 2025 roadmap for the space MMO EVE Online during a Directors' stream. During this stream, it was announced that there will be two major expansions released, as well as the return of a fan-favorite in-game event, such as the EVE Fanfest 2025. This particular event will take place on May 1-3 at Reykjavik's Harpa Concert Hall. For those who want to watch the Directors' Stream from today, it is available to watch on the official CCP Games <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ccpgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> YouTube</a> Channel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Diving into the roadmap for EVE Online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-receives-revenant-expansion-bringing-new-ships-dens-and-more-customizations/"> the Revenant storyline</a> will continue to play out across Q1 as the tensions continue to rise between the Deathless and the Drifters. This will then carry players over to the next expansion for EVE Online, which is set to release in Summer 2025, with a focus on empowering the players, offering new enhanced tools for customization and content creation.</p>
<p>"This year, we're putting even more power in the hands of our capsuleers," said Snorri Arnason, Game Director for EVE Online. "From customizing sovereign space to crafting missions that spark new alliances, the 2025 roadmap is all about letting players create and shape their own moments, their own stories, and ultimately being part of the history books of New Eden itself."</p>
<p>Aside from the summer expansion, as mentioned earlier, fan-favorite events will be making a return to EVE Online. This includes events such as Capsuleer Day, Crimson Harvest, and Winter Nexus. The second expansion for EVE Online is set to release in the Winter of 2025. There haven't been many details about this expansion yet, as more details for the Summer expansion will be yet to come.</p>
<p>For those interested, tickets for EVE Fanfest 2025 are on sale but are nearly sold out. Those who want to attend can purchase tickets from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/eve-fanfest-2025-tickets-716031949837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a>, with the price starting at $35. However, for those who want the full experience of Fanfest, the Festival Pass will cost you $295, which includes access to the party at the Top of the World, exclusive in-game content, an EVE Fanfest 2025 t-shirt, and a goodie bag.</p>
<p>"2025 will be monumental for EVE Online. We've listened to player feedback to refine our development process and create high-quality expansions that empower capsuleers. Join us in New Eden to experience a year filled with characters to meet, alliances to forge - or break - and thrilling stories to uncover. It's a year you don't want to miss!" says Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/martha-is-dead-playstation-cut-content-face-peeling-masturbation/">Wired Productions</a> and Pollar Studio have released the first of three trailers for Karma: The Dark World in the lead-up to the release of the title. Karma: The Dark World is an upcoming first-person psychological horror that's set to channel iconic movie and game directors such as Lynch, Kojima, and Nolan. The first trailer is called 'ROAM.' At the moment, the release date for Karma: The Dark World still hasn't been announced, but it's said that it will soon be announced, most likely coinciding with the trailers that will be released. You can watch the brand-new trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KARMA: The Dark World | ROAM Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQA9fdoVetQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As said above, this is the first of three trailers to be released for Karma: The Dark World, with the developers planning to release them to release key aspects of the game's story, as well as showing off the immersive world and intense gameplay mechanics that you'll have to contend with when playing the game. This first trailer is used to set the stage for the game, so players know what they are getting into when jumping into this first-person psychological horror.</p>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of director David Lynch. His art has had a profound influence on our game development, inspiring us to pay tribute to and learn from his work," said Ke Yang, Art Director of Pollard Studio. Even in the above trailer released, a quote by the iconic director is used to help set the scene.</p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, Karma: The Dark World is a psychological horror title where players will be playing as a Roam Agent and investigating the deepest and darkest secrets of their suspects' minds. The game takes place in an alternate timeline after the war in Germany. In the alternate timeline, Germany has instead fallen into a dystopian state that is ruled over by the Leviathan Corporation. The corporation uses mass surveillance and mind-bending technology to keep an eye on the citizens of the country, providing no privacy at all. Playing as Daniel McGovern, you investigate crime scenes and interview suspects to then report your findings back to Leviathan. However, it's not quite as it seems, and the world begins to crumble around him, where he doubts everything and anyone, including himself.</p>
<p>Karma: The Dark World has been developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released soon on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Karma: The Dark World when it releases?</p>
