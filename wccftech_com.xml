			<p>Aside from Grand Theft Auto VI, which was not featured at Gamescom 2025, Resident Evil Requiem is undoubtedly among the most hyped upcoming titles, and the German convention confirmed it. The first public hands-on of the ninth mainline chapter in CAPCOM's horror franchise convinced press and fans alike, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by the many Gamescom awards won</a>.</p>



<p>During Gamescom, CAPCOM also discussed Resident Evil Requiem in greater depth throughout a few interviews. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tooB3GgtU8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking with Gamesradar</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi explained that the new game will feel like a complete rollercoaster ride thanks to much greater extremes when it comes to all the classic Resident Evil elements of horror, tension, action, and release.</p>



<p><em>I think the two recent titles, Resident Evil 4 remake and Village, are more on the action side of the series in terms of the mixture of elements that they have. Resident Evil Requiem is something different. If I had to compare it to past titles, it's more along the lines of Resident Evil 7 or the Resident Evil 2 remake. You could call it old school Resident Evil, you know, with exploration and backtracking and that kind of thing. It does, of course, feature all the classic core pillars of Resident Evil features that everyone knows and loves, such as combat, exploration, puzzle solving, resource management of limited number of items, and we've given it our own spin this time for Resident Evil Requiem's game atmosphere.</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking then to Resident Evil 7 and 2, I think they reflect a typical game design that we have for this series, where you can't keep the horror tension to the max through the whole game, because it's quite exhausting. So, you need to have this dynamic pacing curve where you'll have a a very tense, horrific sequence, and then we give you a bit of a release or a catharsis from that and let you come down from that with more slightly peaceful exploration or some exciting comba,t and then we gradually bring you back up the horror part of the curve.</em></p>



<p><em>Again, that's the standard practice for Resident Evil. The difference this time is there's a new system that I can't quite get into yet, but if you think of the difference between the tension and the release being a certain size of wavelength, as it were, of that curve, I want to make the distance between those aspects bigger than ever before in the series, and it just becomes a complete roller coaster ride between the different aspects of the series. I'm very excited for people to eventually understand what I mean by that.</em></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to launch on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support path tracing</a> (the first RE Engine title to do so) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

			<p>A new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod now available for download addresses one of the most critical issues found in the PC version of the game: the 60 FPS framerate cap.</p>



<p>The Better Uncap FPS mod, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, allows users to cycle between different FPS targets between 30, 60, 100, 120, 144, and uncapped, with the uncapped option being the default. In addition, the mod also features an experimental audio sync fix, disables Depth of Field, Motion Blur, Refraction Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Lens Distortion, Film Grain, and Tonemapper for cleaner and sharper visuals and fully supports Lossless Scaling. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>

<p>Although this new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod definitely goes a long way in improving the game, the new options are not enough to completely fix a game released in a rather bad state. Some of its visual elements, such as particle effects, cause some massive performance drops, as highlighted on X by Benchmarking, so it definitely looks like developer Virtuos has <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">a lot of work ahead</a> to fix a game that deserved to be released in a much better state on all platforms.</p>
