			<p><strong>1047 Games</strong> is making one, potentially final, bid to keep <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong> alive with a new battle royale mode called <strong>Arena Royale</strong>. If you weren't aware, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is the new title for <strong>Splitgate 2</strong>, a name that emerged after <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">the maligned sequel was relaunched, and 1047 Games decided to shut down the OG Splitgate servers.</a> Arena Reloaded is meant to represent a combination of the best of both games, just like how its new Arena Royale mode is intended to be the best parts of a battle royale and an arena shooter in one.</p>



<p>That's the pitch made by 1047 Games design director <strong>Josh Watson</strong>, who breaks down what the team didn't like about current battle royales and how it let those feelings lead the design of Arena Royale to make a game mode that is still technically a battle royale mode, but in the most arena shooter way possible.</p>



<p>"<em>When we sat down to design Arena Royale, we knew we wanted to push it closer to that arena feel</em>," Watson begins. "<em>And we kept coming back to this core idea: <strong>less looting, more shooting</strong>. You see,</em> <em>traditional battle royales have long stretches where you're not really playing. You're staring at chests, traversing</em> <em>empty space, and waiting for your next fight."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Arena shooters are the opposite. They're about fast action and fast engagement. Arena Royale is the best of both worlds</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Watson goes on to explain some of the core differences between the kind of battle royale you're already familiar with and the kind that 1047 Games has put together. You won't drop from a ship; you'll instead be dropped into a lobby ahead of every match, where you'll vote between one of the four available maps by standing in front of the one you want. </p>



<p>When the match begins, you'll instantly spawn in and go from there. The four available maps (or biomes, as Watson calls them) are <strong>Dought, Glacier, Fracture</strong>, and <strong>Outskirts</strong>, which is an entirely new biome that, frankly, at a quick glance, looks like a smaller knock-off of Kings Canyon from <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. That's not necessarily a bad thing; Kings Canyon is a pretty iconic map with some great POIs. If you're going to pull inspiration from anywhere, might as well pull it from what you know people already like.</p>



<p>Moving forward, other ways in which Arena Royale mixes an arena shooter and a battle royale is by doing away with any battle royale tropes that get in the way of fights. This manifests with chests opening instantly, a player's loot dropping in a big pile instantly when they die (no going through deathboxes), and most importantly, in its low player count, with only <strong>24 players to a match</strong>, in <strong>six teams of four</strong>.</p>



<p>You also won't find buy stations in any of Arena Royale's biomes, as you're able to upgrade equipment on the fly with money earned by doing damage, racking up kills, and completing events like Split Ball, Firecracker, and Hot Zone.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">Since Splitgate 2 relaunched</a>, unfortunately for the team at 1047 Games, it doesn't seem to have taken off. The relaunch came and went without anyone really noticing. The last time we heard from the team ahead of this update was to try and grab some attention and press <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">by responding to claims that the game was dead/dying due to its poor concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Making a big hullabaloo about its lacking Steam numbers did not, it may shock you to learn, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">give it a boost in player numbers on Steam</a>. While Steam concurrent numbers are never the full picture, they're an indicator that, at least on one platform, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded has been unable to gain any serious traction. If that doesn't change, and if things aren't much better on Xbox or PlayStation, then the next time we see a major statement from the studio could very likely be about the studio and the game shutting down.</p>



<p>The Arena Royale mode and the rest of update 2.2 will arrive this Thursday, on <strong>January 22, 2026.</strong></p>

			<p>Following the conclusion of the staff and community polls, it is time to declare the winners of the <strong>Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, which include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games of 2025</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-return-of-aaa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated titles of 2026</a></strong>, based on the nominees from our genre lists.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the results of our best games of 2025 polls. When it comes to last year's releases, the Wccftech staff and our community <strong>agreed on practically every winner except for a single category</strong>, Strategy and Simulation, with our staff giving the award to <strong>Square Enix's Final Fantasy Tactics - Ivalice Chronicles, </strong>while our community preferred <strong>Slipgate's Tempest Rising</strong>.</p>



<p>The clear winner is, to the surprise of absolutely nobody at this point, <strong>Sandfall's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which walks away with <strong>four prizes</strong>: best indie game and <strong>Game of the Year</strong> from both staff and community.</p>



<p>The universally acclaimed game did, however, lose to <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> in the best RPG category. Other multi-winners in the Wccftech Awards '25 include <strong>Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei</strong> in the action category, <strong>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> in the platform category, <strong>Nintendo's Mario Kart World</strong> in the sports/racing category, <strong>AdHoc Studio's Dispatch</strong> in the adventure category, <strong>EA's Battlefield 6</strong> in the shooter category, <strong>KONAMI's Silent Hill f</strong> in the horror category, <strong>KOF Studio's Fatal Fury: City of Wolves</strong> in the fighting category, <strong>Embark's ARC Raiders</strong> in the multiplayer category, and <strong>NEOWIZ's Lies of P: Overture</strong> in the DLC/expansion category. </p>



<p>Without further ado, scroll for the full breakdown of the votes and rankings.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wccftechs-Most-Anticipated-Games-of-2026-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>These five are definitely among the most anticipated games of 2026.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While 2025 was essentially the year of the indie-ish, 2026 <strong>looks a lot more centered around triple-A releases</strong>, featuring heavyweight returns from triple-A developers, franchises, or both.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Wccftech staff and community 2026 polls, they were a fair bit more discordant than the 2025 polls, but that is to be expected given that we're talking about unreleased games. Our own staff also voted differently in a few categories, resulting in a few ties at the top.</p>



<p>Even so, one game emerged above all the others. Yes, it's obviously <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 6</strong>, which received <strong>four prizes</strong>: most anticipated action game from the community, most anticipated multiplayer from the community, and most anticipated overall from both staff (tied) and community. The runner-up for most anticipated prizes is <strong>CAPCOM's Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which got <strong>three</strong>: most anticipated horror game from both staff and community, and most anticipated overall from the staff (tied).</p>



<p>The other multi-winners were <strong>Playground's Fable</strong> (in the RPG category) and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> (in sports/racing), <strong>The Coalition's Gears of War: E-Day</strong> (in shooter), <strong>ARC System Works' MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</strong> (in fighting), <strong>Crystal Dynamics/Flying Wild Hog's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</strong> (in platform), the <strong>untitled STALKER 2 DLC</strong> (in expansion), <strong>Creative Assembly's Total War: Warhammer 40,000</strong> (in strategy/simulation), and <strong>Big Bad Wolf's Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong> (in adventure). </p>



<p>Keep scrolling for the full breakdown per genre.</p>
