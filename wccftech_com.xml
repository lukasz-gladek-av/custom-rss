			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake has reached an important sales milestone, publisher Konami confirmed today.</p>
<p>The remake of the second entry in the series developed by Bloober Team released back in October 2024 on PC and PlayStation 5 has now sold over 2 million units worldwide, counting both retail and digital sales. To mark the occasion, Konami shared a celebratory image to thank fans, which can be found below.</p>

<p>The success the Silent Hill 2 remake is enjoying is completely justified. Bloober Team developed an excellent remake that faithfully reimagines the original without doing away with what makes the original one of the best survival-horror games ever released still to this day, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first two entries in the Dino Crisis are now available on PC via GOG, and they both come with several enhancements over the original releases.</p>
<p>Among the various enhancements included in the new releases of the two classic survival horror series developed by CAPCOM are full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, all localizations, Original, Arrange and Operation Wipe Out modes for the first game, Easy difficulty, Dino Colosseum and Dino Duel for the second, improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. The two games are available as <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">standalone</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchases</a> for $9.99 each or as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">bundle</a> costing $16.99.</p>
<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while and has only recently seen some attention from CAPCOM with the re-release of the first entry of the series on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-is-coming-to-the-playstation-plus-classics-library-new-banner-suggests/">PlayStation Store</a> for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. While series creator <a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shinji Mikami</a> believes the Japanese publisher won't bring back the series while the Monster Hunter franchise continues to be so successful, CAPCOM not only recently registered a new trademark, but is also showing how it is more than willing to bring back dormant franchises with the announcement of new entries in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a> series. Hopefully, the Japanese publisher will show Mikami-san that Dino Crisis and Monster Hunter can easily coexist in the future.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, GeForce NOW users started noticing that the billing system was offline. As it turns out, there's a very good reason for that. NVIDIA <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it is taking over payment processing from a third-party provider. During this transition, existing paid users will effectively be able to play for free. On the flip side, new signups for memberships and upgrades/downgrades from existing plans are paused for the time being. The whole process is expected to last around five weeks.</p>
<p>NVIDIA prepared some answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Why are all memberships &amp; gift cards sold out right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, new sign ups for memberships &amp; day passes along with gift card purchases will be paused.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why am I not getting billed?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider and billing is waived while we complete that process. Your account remains in good standing during this transition.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why can’t I change (upgrade/downgrade) my membership?</strong></em><br>
<em>Membership changes are paused while GeForce NOW transitions to a new payment provider. Recurring billing is waived while we transition payment services and your account remains in good standing.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I use a gift card or promo code right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>Gift cards and promotional codes cannot currently be redeemed but will resume soon. For questions or assistance, please contact NVIDIA Customer Care.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I purchase additional hours right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, you will not be able to purchase additional time. Accounts affected by this change have been migrated to an unlimited playtime account. Those users will continue to enjoy unlimited playtime until their first billing cycle on or after January 1, 2026, as long as their Premium membership remains uninterrupted and in good standing once billing resumes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Does this mean GeForce NOW is shutting down?</strong></em><br>
<em>No, GeForce NOW will continue to operate unabated while we transition payment service providers.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>When will I be billed next?</strong></em><br>
<em>Billing will waived for the duration of the transition, pushing back your next billing cycle by the same length of time. We expect the transition will take a minimum of five weeks. Visit your account portal for further updates.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating its fifth anniversary</a> next week. So far, it delivers the best cloud gaming experience available on the market, thanks to its vast library of games and support for high-end technologies like 4K, 120 FPS, DLSS, HDR, VRR, and even ray tracing for those subscribed to the premium tiers.</p>

			<p>This morning, a Sony press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment-302362728.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> some changes to the PlayStation leadership. Hideaki Nishino will fully take over the role of President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, effective April 1, 2025. You might recall that last year, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> the mildly confusing two-CEO structure, with Nishino leading the Platform Business Group and Hermen Hulst helming the Studio Business Group. Hulst will retain this position, but he'll now report directly to Nishino.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hiroki Totoki is stepping down as Chairman of SIE to become President and CEO of Sony Group Corporation. At the same time, Lin Tao, currently serving as SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy at PlayStation, will step down from her position at SIE to become CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Her successor at SIE will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, Chairman at Sony Interactive Entertainment and President, COO and CFO at Sony Group Corporation, stated:</p>
<p><em>It has been a pleasure working more closely with Hermen and Nishino and gaining insight into the ever-changing, fast-paced world of Sony Interactive Entertainment. As we hand the baton to Nishino and this exceptional leadership team, I am confident that SIE will reach new heights in the days ahead. After 30 years of delivering exceptional entertainment worldwide, this marks an exciting new chapter for SIE, highlighting its commitment to fostering creativity and building meaningful connections for millions of players. I am delighted to welcome Lin as my successor as CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Lin has been instrumental to our success at SIE, leading the Finance, Corporate Development and Strategy functions, and I look forward to working closely with her at Sony Group Corporation.</em></p>
<p>Hideaki Nishino commented on his new role as the sole CEO of the PlayStation division with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation. I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO of the Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Games has <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the release date for Wilds of Talandre, the first (and free) <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> expansion: March 6. Starting on that date, players of NCSoft's MMORPG will get to explore a brand new zone, which includes new story content, an updated level cap (to 55), and several new events, field dungeons, and field bosses. Following the launch, based on the Milestone system, various additional content will be unlocked in Wilds of Talandre, including new regional events, archbosses, and field dungeons.</p>
<p>There's lots more. The expansion is going to add solo dungeons to Throne and Liberty. This activity is meant to be a way for players to get better before they head into more challenging group content, but it'll come with its own rewards.</p>
<p>Speaking of the aforementioned group content, Wilds of Talandre also brings the third tier of group dungeons. 3-Star Dungeons unlock at level 55 and require a minimum of 3,500 Combat Power. At launch, players can expect the following dungeons to be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rancorwood</li>
<li>Mansion of Tragedy</li>
<li>Chapel of Madness</li>
<li>Cruel Witch's Garden</li>
<li>Assassin's Lab</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential loot drops include the powerful Epic II Gear Sets, Training Dew, Amitoi, Abyssal Contract Token Points, and, of course, crafting materials. Players will also get rewards that can be used to craft items that drop Dimensional Soul Shards in each 3-Star Dungeon.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty is getting a new cross-server PvPvE activity called Nebula Island. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. The island features a central village (the Resistance Surveillance Camp) and six different regions, including one peaceful zone (the Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always active. Various hunting grounds can be accessed through portals from the Resistance Surveillance Camp. On Nebula Island, players will also find hourly events and periodic limited-participation field boss battles.</p>
<p>The Weapon Mastery system has been revamped, and there's a brand new Artifact System as well. Artifacts can be obtained from Nebula Island and from the Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region. The system consists of six parts: four Talistones, a Solar Stone, and a Lunar Stone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different Artifact sets across three grades (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare). Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching pieces from the same set. The Solar Stone provides an Active Skill, while the Lunar Stone grants a Passive Skill when equipped.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wilds of Talandre adds some new lifestyle content: 24 new fish, 4 new fishing rods, new collectibles, and 10 new cooking recipes and food items. Players will also have another reason to gather ingredients in Throne and Liberty as the 5 types of Elixir items (Excellent Attack/Defence Elixirs, Rare Attack/Defence/Purification Elixirs) can now be cooked.</p>
