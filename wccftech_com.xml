			<p>Two minutes past midnight on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a>, a leaker who has previously been accurate when making claims on Nintendo events, dropped a tease for a new Nintendo Direct coming next month, specifically, September 12, 2025. Following that tease, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> corroborated SwitchForce's claim by reporting that its sources have stated a Nintendo Direct is coming mid-September, though they did not take a stab at the date.</p>



<p>VGC did, however, point out that there's been a Nintendo Direct in September for nearly as long as Nintendo Directs have been around, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOooMjvltuQbJgWKKYXh3mNz-5KKgkJS8-AvxntJwYVDaiACa8RKC">save for last year</a>, and that if it is on September 12, that would put the Direct one day ahead of the Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary.</p>



<p>While we've had leaks and reports accurately predict dates for these Direct events, what's always been less accurate in that kind of early reporting is the size of the event, regarding whether it'll be a full-blown general Direct, with first and third-party news. Or, if it's just a third-party Partner Showcase, or an Indie World Direct, or a Direct focused entirely on one game.</p>



<p>The most recent Nintendo Direct presentation was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">Kirby Air Riders-dedicated showcase, </a>with Masahiro Sakurai spending 45 minutes detailing everything you'll need to know about the return of the cult-classic racer. Before that, it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, and before that, we had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/">Donkey Kong Bananza-focused Direct</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>



<p>In April, when Nintendo finally revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, was the last time we had a general Nintendo Direct. Hopefully, with three Directs focused on one specific game and a partner showcase between April and now, we're due for a bigger, general Direct that debuts what Nintendo has planned for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>Namely, the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one announcement that could appear tomorrow. The last we heard, it was due for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/"> late 2025 release</a>. There was also a playable demo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> in Germany and Fan Expo in Canada.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Turok: Origins, a sort of reboot of the classic sci-fi shooter franchise. </p>



<p>As some old-school gamers may already know, Turok was originally a comic book character who appeared as a master Native American tracker, survivalist, and hunter in late 1954 in comics published by Dell Comics. Later, he would also appear in comics published by Valiant Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Dynamite Comics, but his fame mainly came from the successful video game series created by Acclaim in 1997. Five years later, just before the launch of Turok: Evolution, Acclaim could boast that the franchise had already generated over $250 million in sales revenue.</p>



<p>However, the IP's luck didn't last much longer. Following the release of Evolution, there was only one more installment, the 2008 game developed by a studio called Propaganda Games. While not well-received by critics, the game sold more than one million copies in its first two months on the market, prompting the Vancouver-based studio to start working on a sequel. Propaganda was owned by Disney Interactive Studios, though, which decided to shut down the studio (and the new Turok title) in 2011 after Tron: Evolution also disappointed.</p>



<p>Around seventeen years later, Saber Interactive is hoping to reignite the interest of long-time fans in the series. They are, after all, quite experienced in the feat following the successful revival of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, not to mention the upcoming Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>During a Gamescom 2025 presentation, we learned that most of Saber Madrid, a studio composed of around 250 employees, has been working on Turok: Origins for nearly five years now. The game will feature a story campaign of around fifteen hours, and the narrative will somehow connect to that first game installment from 1997.</p>



<p>The story sees the legendary warriors dealing not only with the usual dinosaurs but also with an alien threat, the so-called Xenia civilization, that seeks to eradicate all human life from the galaxy. The Turok and humankind as a whole are losing the war, so they embark on an interplanetary quest to find a superpower capable of turning the tide of the conflict. Yes, that means there will be various planets to visit in the final game; Ancient temples, wasteland canyons, and dense jungles are just a few examples of the places you'll find in Turok: Origins. </p>



<p>Following the brief presentation, we tried a demo of the game itself. The game supports three-player online cooperative action, so it's no wonder that there are three playable characters with their own weapons and perks and Ultimate abilities. During game sessions, players can also extract Echoes from fallen foes and the environment to unlock powers in real-time.</p>



<p>Other than that, Turok: Origins plays like pretty standard shooter fare. The maps are fairly linear and don't allow that much exploration, so you'll just be mowing down enemies while heading toward the next control point. When you have injured a foe enough, you can swoop into melee range to trigger a cool-looking execution move. The demo required using the grappling hook occasionally, but it was only available at predefined points, rather than giving players free rein on where to go.</p>



<p>One thing that long-time franchise fans will be happy to learn is that the developers have added the option to switch in real-time (by long-pressing the d-pad) between first and third-person view. The game had been announced as a third-person title, but Turok games have always been played in first-person view, and now you have that option available.</p>



<p>The highlight of the demo was the boss fight with a giant Tryceratops-like creature, which not only charged us but could also teleport and had a lightning attack. Indeed, Saber had previously said that the Xenia aliens control some of the dinosaurs with their technology and have empowered them with it.</p>



<p>Turok: Origins doesn't have a release window yet, but it looked fairly polished based on the Gamescom 2025 demo. Whether its structure and content will be enough to draw players remains to be seen once the final version becomes available. Meanwhile, we can confirm that the game will run at 60 frames per second on consoles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">except for the Xbox Series S version</a>). </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA will Announce the Early Access Release Date for Skate Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-announce-the-early-access-release-date-for-skate-tomorrow.1279731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next entry in EA's Skate series will have its cover art revealed tomorrow, but more importantly, the early access release date for Skate is due to be announced in a new trailer premiering tomorrow, August 26, 2025, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BST.</p>



<p>EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-into-early-access-in-summer-2025-major-playtest-update-coming-july-2/">announced this past June</a> that Skate would launch in early access sometime this summer. Well, at the time of this writing, summer is nearly over, so if that's still the case, then we might see Skate get shadow-dropped tomorrow. Or, it'll be out in the coming weeks. Either way, Skate has been in closed playtesting for months at this point, and considering that it'll be an early access release, it feels like EA could decide to launch it at any point.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Which, admittedly, feels odd considering the amount of excitement there was around the return of the series when EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-new-studio-full-ciricle-staffing-up/">first announced it.</a> Back in 2021, when Full Circle was just starting up for the purposes of making this new Skate game, you never would have guessed that the hype around a Skate 4 would wane as much as it has, or that EA might just drop the game without much of a marketing lead-up.</p>



<p>In fairness, that was before we knew that this new iteration of Skate would be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">full live service-focused game</a>, and that it would require <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players to always be online</a>. Neither fact has helped ingratiate players to this new version, and it'll be interesting to see how the early access release fares once it is in public hands and no longer just for playtesters with access to a closed beta.</p>



<p>After years of waiting, tomorrow, Skate fans will finally have a date to look forward to for a new Skate game.</p>
