			<p>Leaks and rumors about the performance of the future PS6 console have significantly increased lately. Last Friday, YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> estimates of the PlayStation 6's rasterization performance, suggesting that it would be three times as fast as the base PlayStation 5, which would put it around the level of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080. Later, the same YouTuber <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the performance uplift during ray tracing operations will be much higher, between five and ten times as fast as the base PS5.</p>



<p>Now, though, AMD insider KeplerL2 has shared different predictions. <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270687172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to him</a>, the PS6 will be around the performance level of the AMD Radeon RX 9070XT, AMD's current flagship GPU. However, the next-generation Xbox will be slightly more powerful, with KeplerL2 comparing it to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080. Both consoles will be powered by AMD's RDNA 5 architecture, which KeplerL2 reckons will be the largest architectural overhaul since the Graphics Core Next (GCN) era. Additionally, the insider said it will have even more features than NVIDIA's latest architecture, Blackwell; to prove that, the insider linked to several AMD patents:</p>

</ul>



<p>The comment around the next-generation Xbox is interesting because Moore's Law Is Dead has suggested that Microsoft's upcoming console (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powered by the Magnus APU</a>) would be less powerful than the PS6. Microsoft did <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise</a> its fans a year and a half ago that the next console would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever' seen in a hardware generation.</p>



<p>Considering these consoles are still two to three years out, we may have to wait a long time to get the official specs. That said, we'll keep reporting on credible leaks and rumors in the meantime.</p>

			<p>Today, Microsoft announced the Game Pass lineup for August. The highlight of the lineup is undoubtedly Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will be available starting on Thursday, August 7.</p>



<p>The game, released in late 2023, was originally meant to be an expansion to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but Ubisoft later decided to make it a standalone title, albeit one that was not an open world action RPG like most of the latest titles in the franchise. Assassin's Creed Mirage was well-received by critics and fans. As to the former, here's an excerpt of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 8/10 review of the game</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>



<p>There are rumors that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be getting a DLC</a> funded by the Savvy Games Group, but there's no confirmation for the time being. Even if that turns out to be true, you'd have to pay it separately from the Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage, the following games are being added to Microsoft's subscription service this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rain World (already available through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>MechWarrior 5: Clans (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Aliens: Fireteam Elite (available via cloud, console, and PC starting on August 12 for Game Pass Ultimate, PC GP, and GP Standard)</li>



<li>9 Kings (available via Game Preview on PC via August 14 for Game Pass Ultimate and PC GP)</li>
</ul>
