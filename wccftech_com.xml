			<p>The new <a href="https://wccftech.com/sniper-elite-4-coming-to-the-mac-ipad-iphone-later-this-year/">Sniper Elite</a> game is slated for release on January 30, 2025. The full title of the game is Sniper Elite: Resistance, and it will take players through a standalone story that runs parallel to Sniper Elite 5. You play Harry Hawker, an agent of the Special Operations Executive, and you have to fight back against the Nazis in occupied France. For those eager to get their hands on the game, Sniper Elite: Resistance will launch physically and digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Microsoft Store. Additionally, Sniper Elite: Resistance will be available via Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance â€“ Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyqDitom1QQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is the Standard Edition of the game, as well as a Deluxe Edition, which will include Season Pass content. Those who pre-order the game, regardless of the edition, will get the bonus campaign mission called "Target Fuhrer," as well as an additional weapon skin and the Karabiner 98 Rifle. For those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition of Sniper Elite: Resistance, you'll get the classic M1911 Pistol as well as two days of Early Access.</p>
<p>The overview provided by <a href="https://rebellion.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebellion Developments</a> states that there are "unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth, and tactical third-person combat you would expect from the franchise." Instead of focusing on the front line happening in World War II, it focuses on the "hidden war," far from the front lines, that takes place deep in the heart of occupied France.</p>
<p>There will be a full-length campaign to play through, in either solo play or co-op. There will be the option to customize and upgrade your weapons to help you make your way through difficult challenges. Of course, much like any Sniper Elite game, the trademark X-ray kill cam will be returning, providing you with a glimpse into the pure destruction in each shot from your weapons.</p>
<p>For those who want to participate in multiplayer but don't want to team up with friends in the campaign, there are multiple multiplayer modes available, including the fan favorite Invasion mode and adversarial multiplayer.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release date of Sniper Elite: Resistance, a brand-new trailer has been uploaded to Youtube, with the video being just over a minute long.&nbsp; If you want to pre-order the game, it will cost you $49.99 for the Standard Edition of the game and $79.99 for the Deluxe Edition of Sniper Elite: Resistance. Check out the trailer for yourself in the video above.</p>
