			<p>According to SEGA's <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250618_Management_large_MTG_all_e.pdf">latest fiscal report</a>, the recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/"> Persona 4 Revival</a> and RGG Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> might not be out on store shelves until 2027.</p>
<p>Included on a slide in the presentation about what's defined as the "<em>medium-term pipeline</em>" for SEGA and its release schedule, five announced games are listed, including Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, which is due out on September 25, 2025.</p>
<p>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, which is already out at this time of writing, Football Manager, set for a 2025 launch, and Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven.</p>
<p>Both Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven are listed as "<em>announced titles to be released in or after FY2027/3.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This release window doesn't lock in either game to releasing in 2027. SEGA's 2027 fiscal year will begin in the 2026 calendar year, which means either, or even both games, could still likely make it out in the back half of 2026.</p>
<p>But it does give us a sense that we could be waiting until 2027 for at least one of these games, if not both, to make it out the door.</p>
<p>We heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">rumors and teases</a> about Persona 4 Revival for months leading up to its official reveal, and Stranger Than Heaven was first known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Project Century</a>&nbsp;before its official title was announced this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. A two-year wait time for either game sounds about right, considering the pace at which modern video games are made.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll be hearing more about both games soon, though if they really aren't going to be out in 2026, we might not hear any more from SEGA about either game for the rest of 2025 while the teams working on them are heads-down in development.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country has gone gold ahead of its August 8, 2025, release date, developer Hangar 13 has announced.</p>
<p>The studio posted a short video clip on the <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1936076608135172440">official Mafia X account</a> announcing the news, as the team now shifts to focusing on polish and making sure Mafia: The Old Country is ready for prime-time when it releases in August.</p>
<p>The Old Country is a prequel and a return for the series after the last brand-new Mafia game came out in 2016. Since then, we've had a remake of the first game and remasters for the second and third games, but nothing brand new until now.</p>
<p>Hangar 13 has claimed that this will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-says-mafia-the-old-country-will-be-the-best-looking-mafia-game-thanks-to-unreal-engine-5/">"<em>the best looking Mafia game</em>"</a> in the series, and, through the studio's work with Italian developer Stormind Games, has put in the effort to make everything about players' journey in Italy <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-in-mafia-the-old-country-feels-authentic-says-co-developer/">an "<em>authentic</em>" experience</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic</em>," said senior project manager at Stormind Games, Salvo Fallica. "<em>The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player</em>," added Hangar 13's lead writer Matthew Aitken.</p>
<p>We've seen plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/">gameplay footage</a> and heard a lot from Hangar 13 about how much work they've put in to this release. We'll see in August if this is a strong return for the series or not.</p>
