			<p>The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/343?utm_source=MergeMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mergemail-campaign-439411">latest patch</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Escape From Tarkov</a> adds plenty of fixes and improvements based directly on feedback from players, addressing several highly requested quality of life features, fixes for enemy AI in both PvE and PvP, and audio.</p>
<p>Developer Battlestate Games says that the "<em>audio engine systems and its individual subsystems have been significantly expanded to provide a more immersive Escape from Tarkov experience.</em>"</p>
<p>Battlestate Games warns that while the patch "<em>has gone through several stages of testing,</em>" it still isn't the final version, so players could still experience "<em>unexpected audio behavior in various situations</em>."</p>
<p>The studio is releasing this patch as another stage in its testing for these fixes, adding that "<em>this stage is necessary to collect feedback and do more tests on a diverse variety of players' hardware and software. We are already preparing a set of fixes for the upcoming updates and your feedback and detailed issue reports will help us in refining and stabilizing the system for all players</em>."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes coming for audio, AI, and the quality of life improvements for Escape from Tarkov from the latest patch notes:</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Readjusted the sound subsystem that checks for obstructions between the listener and the source:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the sound processing between the listener and the source when the source was behind obstacles: uneven terrain, rocks, vehicles, crates, and other environmental elements;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where various sounds were processed and muffled incorrectly;</em><br>
<em>Improved the sound penetration processing inside and outside interiors with walls of different thickness</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the sound penetration processing between floors of buildings and on stairways;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the occlusion of interactive windows and doors;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Reduced the loudness of bushes in first and third person;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the cause of the missing announcer warnings upon using the interactive buttons in The Lab;</em></li>

</ul>
<h3>AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the interaction of bots with doors;</em></li>
<li><em>PMC bots will now try to avoid areas where the location Bosses initially spawn and are less likely to engage in combat with them;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where bots could walk down stairs or other uneven surfaces faster than usual;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the causes for bots appearing in the air or in the ground;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the specific situations in which bots would tilt their weapons upwards for no reason;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the issues in which Boss guards and PMC bots were friendly to each other;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues in which The Goons would appear on multiple locations at the same time in PvE.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>

			<p>Xbox has confirmed through <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1937133550869876827">a post on X</a> that it will be attending Gamescom 2025, which likely means another showcase from the company sometime between August 20 and 24.<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1937136830014754891"> Bethesda</a> and the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24215994">World of Warcraft team at Blizzard</a> will also be attending the event.</p>
<p>We've had a Gamescom showcase from Xbox each year since 2021, with last year's attendance including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-3-days-of-livestreams-for-gamescom-2024/">multiple livestreams for Xbox games</a>. While we don't yet know what we'll see at this year's show, there are a few games we should look forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> event the company hosted, we now have a clearer idea of what's due out in the fall from Microsoft, meaning there's a good chance we'll learn more about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which is currently set to release sometime before the end of the year. It could also be where we get the official announcement of the recently leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement/">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a> VR headset, and potentially some VR ports of Xbox games.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> could very likely get one more big marketing push before its October 29, 2025, release date. The same is likely for the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLC</a> that's due out on September 4, 2025.</p>
<p>There's also a strong chance we'll see more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Black Ops 7</a>, after Xbox capped off its Summer Game Fest showcase with this year's entry in the Call of Duty franchise. Each game in the series is usually out sometime between October and November, so it's likely we'll get a release date reveal during whatever showcase Xbox hosts.</p>
<p>There's also a chance we see a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which was also featured during the SGF event that Xbox hosted. We got a release window with its SGF trailer, so it's possible we'll get a proper release date with a new trailer for Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>And now that we have a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, it wouldn't be a surprise if Team Ninja and Platinum Games have a new gameplay trailer set for Gamescom 2025, and potentially a show-floor gameplay demo for those in attendance.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that even if Xbox doesn't host a livestream event, however unlikely that may seem, its attendance at Gamescom 2025 does make it likely that anything we've seen from the company that we know is coming this fall will likely be available to demo ahead of that fall release date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll find out more official information soon.</p>
