			<p>Ubisoft wasn't a part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> in the traditional way, with its own<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/"> Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation taking place at some point within the already jam-packed weekend, but it did appear in some SGF 2025 events with a couple of release date announcements and the reveal of a brand new game.</p>
<p>Starting with the release date reveal, we now know that Anno 117: Pax Romana will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 13, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The new release date trailer for Anno 117 showed off a bit more gameplay and plenty of glamor shots of the game, though if you want a dedicated gameplay deep-dive, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-gets-first-gameplay-showcase/">can check out the previous trailer Ubisoft showed off.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6a37J87bew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was The Rogue Prince of Persia, a 2D-platforming Prince of Persia game from Evil Empire that released in early access last year. Unfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date, but we did get a release window for the 1.0 update, which is due to arrive sometime in <strong>August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the game has evolved since its early access release, which was already a strong foundation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo regarded its early access launch highly, writing</a>, "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite.</em>"</p>

<p>Lastly, Ubisoft revealed a new title it is publishing from developer Screen Juice, called Morbid Metal. It's a new hack-and-slash roguelite with semi-procedurally generated levels, set in what appears to be some kind of dystopian future. It's due to arrive on PC in early access on&nbsp;<strong>August 20, 2025,</strong> and will feature three playable characters at launch that'll each have their own unique playstyles.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">demo you can play on Steam right now</a>, if you're keen to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Gameplay Trailer - PC Gaming Show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL9ArylnvzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>None of these were exactly the announcements players had expected from Ubisoft during the Summer Game Fest weekend. There was nothing about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">Splinter Cell,</a> or any of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">Assassin's Creed</a> games currently in development. There wasn't even a last-ditch push for <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, the biggest change to Siege in the game's history, which launches tomorrow at the time of this writing. There was also no mention of what's next for <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry</a>, or the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>With 2025 officially lacking a Ubisoft Forward event, it's unlikely we'll hear about any of those titles and series the rest of the year, unless the company decides to drop news for its biggest franchises in a third-party show like Gamescom ONL or The Game Awards. The company is going through <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">several major changes</a>, so it's not surprising that it doesn't have very much to showcase at the moment, but a muted 2025 does not bode well for the company after its extremely disappointing 2024.</p>
