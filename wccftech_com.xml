			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch has gone live today for the PC version of the game, introducing new content and improvements.</p>



<p>The 1.20 patch, which is around 4.9 GB big, introduces seven new arranged tracks based on existing music as a token of appreciation for all the love and support from fans. Additionally, the new patch also unlocks Hard Mode difficulty from the start, which is a very welcome change as Stellar Blade at normal difficulty isn't a particularly challenging game.</p>



<p>Besides introducing new arranged music and unlocking Hard Mode from the start, the new Stellar Blade patch brings a slew of fixes for a variety of issues, such as an issue specific to the "Where is the Fantastic Bait" quest, another related to the NIKKE minigame which made EVE's gun disappear, and a few others. The patch also improves the Expected VRAM display in the graphics options menu, and now shows both current usage and expected maximum usage. You can learn more about the 1.20 patch and what it does by reading the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535480083734855862?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Following its release last year on PlayStation 5, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last month, becoming an instant success by selling over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units </a>in three days. As of now, developer Shift Up hasn't confirmed if the game is hitting other formats in the future, but there's a very good chance it will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 at some point, as the developer is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">nvestigating the possibility</a> of a port.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>Today, South Korean developer Nyou provided an update on its upcoming PC MMORPG, Bellatores. Sign-ups for a Closed Beta Test to be conducted via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3397040/Bellatores/">Steam</a> will open on July 8, while the actual CBT will run for five days from July 30 to August 3. In the CBT version, players will be able to choose from 2 out of 5 planned noble Houses, and the test will focus on core content such as combat, progression, and the skill system.</p>



<p>CEO Jung Hwan Kim stated:</p>



<p><em>Through this CBT, we aim to evaluate whether Bellatores delivers the gameplay experience we envision, in collaboration with the players. We plan to actively incorporate player feedback.</em></p>



<p>You might recall that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bellatores-qa-pc-mmorpg-gets-in-depth-info-on-pvp-combat-system-game-mechanics-and-release-window/">interviewed</a> the studio CEO a while ago. Back then, the game was being made with Unreal Engine 4 and its combat system was going to use tab-targeting, like the MMOs of old (think EverQuest, World of Warcraft, and up to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic). Now, though, there have been major changes: Nyou has switched to Unreal Engine 5 and also decided to go for full-fledged action combat, with weapon switching and stamina management playing a major role in fights.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Bellatores will also innovate with its skill-based progression system. Here's what Producer Lee Gi Baek revealed in today's new developer diary:</p>



<p><em>A key feature of Bellatores is its Mastery based progression. Instead of following fixed class paths or a linear leveling system, players will accumulate Mastery in different aspects of combat, survival, or crafting based on the weapons they use and the activities they engage in. As you accumulate Mastery and reach certain milestones, you will unlock unique abilities or new combat styles. This approach to player progression will allow for players to experience different playstyles that will change based on what Masteries you acquire.</em></p>



<p><em>Crafting Mastery will also play an important role. Crafting efficiency, resource yields, and the chance to create rare items will all hinge on a player's crafting Mastery. Furthermore, equipment won't be available as farming drops, but are gained exclusively through crafting or trading with other players. Moreover, the appearance and stats of crafted items will vary depending on the creator's Mastery, making crafting not just an optional feature but a core system that ties in player progression with the community.</em></p>



<p><em>However, there will be a limit to how many Expert Masteries a single player can earn in Bellatores. It will be impossible to obtain or handle everything on your own. To get everything you need, players will naturally need to cooperate with one another. This system was designed to encourage active community interactions, a core essence of MMORPGs. As such, players will be able to develop personalized characters with unique identities based on their Masteries, which in turn will affect combat, survival, crafting, economic, and political activities. The goal of the Mastery system is to avoid forcing uniform content on all players, but instead, letting each player enjoy the roleplay they want based on their own playstyle.</em></p>



<p>The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended system requirements for Bellatores:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum</strong>:<br>OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or newer)<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400, AMD Ryzen 5 4600H<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 6600<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Network: Broadband Internet connection<br>Storage: 80 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD required<br></p>



<p><strong>Recommended</strong>:<br>OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or newer)<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K, AMD Ryzen 5 5600x<br>Memory: 32 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Network: Broadband Internet connection<br>Storage: 80 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD required</p>



<p>Bellatores will launch in 2026 in Russia. However, the CEO of Nyou confirmed to Wccftech that the game is still seeking a Western publisher. We'll let you know when that changes.</p>

			<p>This morning, game developer and publisher KRAFTON <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a studio leadership change for Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds, one of its subsidiaries. KRAFTON had <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">announced</a> the acquisition of Unknown Worlds in October 2021 for an undisclosed sum. There were no changes right away. Now, though, the original founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) will be replaced by Steve Papoutsis, former Visceral Games executive and co-creator of Dead Space. Interestingly, Papoutsis was previously the CEO of Striking Distance Studios, another studio owned by KRAFTON (they made The Callisto Protocol).</p>



<p>CH Kim, CEO of KRAFTON, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around&nbsp;Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible. We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds to deliver&nbsp;Subnautica 2&nbsp;as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series—one that truly lives up to player expectations.</em> <em>KRAFTON puts players at the heart of every decision because they deserve the absolute best. We understand how eager our community is to dive into the underwater world of&nbsp;Subnautica 2, and we are working diligently to deliver an experience that meets those expectations—while maintaining our unwavering commitment to quality and player experience. We deeply appreciate the patience and trust of our Subnauts, and we are doing everything possible to ensure the final result is worth the wait.</em></p>



<p>Steve Papoutsis, the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, added:</p>



<p><em>I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the KRAFTON family and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the&nbsp;Subnautica&nbsp;community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie, and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">Subnautica 2</a> is scheduled to launch later this year in early access on PC and Xbox Series S|X. It will also be available via Game Pass.</p>
