			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has yet to be released, but a talented fan has already managed to quite convincingly reimagine a small portion of the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, an alleged leaked video of the new entry in the series started making the rounds, fooling the vast majority of fans with its great attention to detail. The short video, however, isn't a real leaked video of Grand Theft Auto 6, but an Unreal Engine 5 creation made to look as close as possible to the real leaked videos of the game, which surfaced online a while back, made by a developer known as Long Long Time in around one month. While it may have been disappointing to learn that the video wasn't the first look at the game in a very long time, it is still an interesting watch that showcases the developer's amazing talent at creating a very believable slice of a game we have seen very little of so far.</p>

<p>No matter when it will launch, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to have a huge impact on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">video game industry</a> as a whole, so much so that some publishers are planning the release of their own titles so as not to coincide with its launch. Analysts also predict it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, and its failure could have some important consequences for the industry. Not that a failure is likely, judging from fake leaks like the one above, as the hype for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only getting bigger the more we inch closer to its late 2025 launch.</p>
