			<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion will continuously deliver exclusive content to owners throughout the coming season. The news was confirmed by Blizzard Diablo Franchise Manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/480711/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-exclusive-season-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Because we know that the beginning of a season is sort of a fresh starting point, we wanted to launch the expansion at the same time as the beginning of a season. Thatâ€™s why we launched at the beginning of season 6, so you could roll a Spiritborn as your new thing. So it can feel like a little bit like this expansion is just a single moment in time, and I just wanted to highlight that thatâ€™s not the case. Weâ€™re going to continue to develop features that will be, essentially, exclusive to Vessel of Hatred owners. As we continue chapter two, as a Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred owner, youâ€™ll get access to other stuff in chapter two as part of your ownership. So weâ€™re going to continue to have Vessel of Hatred be valuable beyond season 6 as well.</em></p>
<p>This actually began with the launch of Vessel of Hatred. Runewords are, so far, exclusive to owners of the expansion, and more Runewords will be added with Season 7. As we reported last week, Patch 2.1 will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on the Public Test Realm, delivering the long-awaited Armory feature, brand new Witch-like powers, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diablo IV is currently enjoying a free trial for both the expansion and the main game itself, up to level 25. On this subject, Fergusson explained:</p>
<p><em>We were looking at ways of creating a boost for players to be able to say, Hey, welcome back, Eternal player. Maybe you havenâ€™t played in a while. Letâ€™s get you cleaned up. Letâ€™s give you a shave and haircut here. So you donâ€™t have to do all the 'I got to spend two hours just cleaning up before I can go and play'. In the last 18 months, so much has changed. But if youâ€™re an Eternal player who played the campaign and then stopped, you donâ€™t know. You havenâ€™t felt this 18 months of evolution.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-the-last-of-us-part-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler fares fairly well in The Last of Us Part 1, although it is inferior to both AMD FSR 2 and NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro update released for the remake of the first entry in the series, also providing a comparison between the AI-powered upscaler featured in the mid-generation system, AMD FSR 2, and NVIDIA DLSS. For comparison, the PC version was running with similar graphics settings, and sharpening was set at the lowest for both FSR 2 and DLSS, as PSSR seems to not use post-process sharpening.</p>
<p>Compared to AMD FSR 2, the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler shows once again how it delivers a slightly better image in motion, as FSR 2 aliases foliage and fine geometry more. Still, PSSR features some image noise that FSR 2 doesn't, so the two upscalers are pretty much equivalent in The Last of Us Part 1, although FSR 2 delivers a sharper, more stable image than PSSR with the camera at rest.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in other games, NVIDIA DLSS is clearly superior to the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler in the vast majority of scenarios, delivering a basically faultless image quality at rest while looking very smooth in motion, even in Performance mode. PSSR, on the other hand, manages to maintain image detail in motion better than NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how the new Sony upscaler has the potential to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">much better in the future</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 1/Part 2 - PS5 Pro Tech Review + PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 2 Face-Off" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coyPienBLGk?start=486&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the features that make the PlayStation 5 Pro a better system than the base model. You can learn more about them in our review.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation event like a Showcase or State of Play could be coming soon, judging from what a very reliable leaker revealed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, billbil-kun, who proved to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that a lot of PlayStation content is being prepared behind the scenes, and some new announcements are coming, although the insider cannot say if an event is indeed coming. Seeing as there's a lot of content being prepared, it is unlikely it is just for this year's upcoming The Game Awards show, so something could indeed be brewing outside of single, separate announcements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðŸ‘€<br>
A PlayStation event is really happening soon?</p>
<p>I don't have the answer, but many PlayStation stuff are being prepared behind the scenes,</p>
<p>Some fresh news are coming,<br>
Stay tuned... <a href="https://t.co/IrLUZjgLTl">pic.twitter.com/IrLUZjgLTl</a></p>
<p>â€” billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1860979631148396721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been a very long time since the latest proper PlayStation Showcase, as Sony opted to go with usually smaller State of Play presentations for a while. A September showcase to present the PlayStation 5 Pro was long rumored, but it never happened as Sony presented the console without the big presentation many expected to see.</p>
<p>Besides working on games coming in the next year and beyond, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Sony seems to be quite active on the hardware front as well, developing not only the PlayStation 6, which will once again be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, but apparently also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">PlayStation 5 handheld system</a> that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. Plans for the release of this system, however, have yet to be finalized, so there's the chance it will never be launched. As the company has somewhat gotten back into the handheld market with the PlayStation Portal after the commercial failure of the PS Vita and Microsoft working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> portable system of its own</a>, it would be surprising for Sony to skip getting fully back into what is becoming more and more a very lucrative space, as highlighted by the many handheld systems that launched on the market after the release of the Steam Deck.</p>
