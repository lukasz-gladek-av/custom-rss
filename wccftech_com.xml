			<p>Earlier this year, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Assassin's Creed Mirage would receive a new 'DLC' funded by Savvy Games Group, an investment company created by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). </p>



<p>Ubisoft has now officially <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> during the ESports World Cup 2025 (taking place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia) that the game will indeed receive new content in 2025 and will be free, too.</p>



<ul>
<li>New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th-century al-Ula</li>



<li>Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Ula is an ancient Arabian oasis city located in Medina Province, which is part of modern-day Saudi Arabia, whereas the base game takes place in Baghdad, Iraq.</p>



<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage launched on October 5, 2023, earning positive reviews from critics. Wccftech's Nathan Birch rated it 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his review</a>:</p>



<p><em>The core Assassin’s Creed Mirage campaign doesn’t overstay its welcome, clocking in at around 12 to 15 hours, but there’s also a hearty amount of side content to tackle. Bonus contracts, “Tales of Baghdad” story bits you can run across while exploring the city, and, of course, tons of chests to loot and collectibles to grab. While Mirage doesn’t have XP or RPG-like leveling, there are still ways to improve your abilities as skill points are awarded for completing missions and you can collect crafting materials to improve your weapons and gear. There’s more than enough here to justify Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s reasonable $50 asking price, but you needn't worry about the game murdering all your free time.</em></p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>
