			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was a strong remaster, not just because it was a great Unreal Engine 5 upgrade for a decade-old game, but because it included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for fans to solve, with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-subway-escape-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858%3Fl%3Denglish&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=49867ab213c4ee089d653e284f7a2968&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">16 of those puzzles</a> being made by fans who collaborated with Croteam on the expansion. So it's no surprise that these are some of the most difficult puzzles to solve in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through how to solve the Castle puzzle in the expansion, one of the more complicated puzzles. If you don't want the whole solution, and just want a hint, then the best hint I can give is that you need to make lasers fly.</p>
<p>If you want the full solution, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Castle Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Gather all the pieces</h3>
<p>When you enter the Castle puzzle area, you'll notice that the tetromino is on an elevated platform that you can only reach by a fan directly underneath it, and that you'll need to get both a red and blue laser to the nodes on either side of this elevated platform to reach the tetromino.</p>
<p>To do that, you first need all the pieces you'll need. Basically, this puzzle is one part gather the pieces, the other part execution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start by grabbing the fan off the vent below where you fly up to the tetromino, and place the fan on the pressure switch directly in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;With the fan on the pressure switch, you'll be able to reach the first connector (C1). Connect it to the red node and red laser generator that you can see through the window, and the red node on the wall behind you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan from the pressure switch, and use the fan that's activated to fly yourself (with the first fan in hand) over the gate and into the walled-off area with a deactivated fan vent and a second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan on the vent to activate it, grab the connector and use it to get back across to the other room, without having to pass through the purple forcefield between them.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring C2 into the main puzzle area, and grab the fan you used to fly yourself over the gate the first time, and place it on the first pressure switch you activated. Now you're free to grab C1 and carry it to the center puzzle area, so that you have two connectors and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator that's on the left side of the puzzle area, and place it down on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area. Connect it to the red node in the room on the right side of the puzzle area to clear the path to a box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the box and bring it to the center puzzle area.&nbsp;Place the box on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area (removing the fan first) and using C1, connect it to the blue laser generator on the right side of the puzzle area and the blue node on the left side of the puzzle area. Place C1 on top of the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, and the red node that's hidden behind the shield you're deactivating with the blue lasers to release the third connector (C3). Bring the third connector into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you nearly have all the components you need. All that's left is the box stuck behind a shield on the right side of the center puzzle area, with a red and blue node on either side to deactivate it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Take the box off the pressure switch, and replace it with C1. Connect C1 to the red laser generator.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the blue laser generator, and the blue node in the center puzzle area on the right side.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the other side of the shield. Place C3 on top of the box, making sure the box is somewhere that you can angle C3 to hit C1 and the red node.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>If you've done it correctly, your laser layout will look something like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the second box and bring it to the center puzzle area. You should now have two boxes, three connectors, and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Make the lasers fly</h3>
<p>Now you have all the components, you're ready to make the lasers fly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one box, head up the stairs on the right side of the center puzzle area and place it in front of the fan underneath the blue node. Do the same with the other box on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1, and connect it to the blue laser generator, the blue node above the box, and the blue node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on top of the box under the blue node when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the room. Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the blue laser generator. Make sure the angles are set, and when you place C3 down, you should see the box and C1 on top of it flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node above the box, and the red node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on the box when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick the fan back up, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area. Grab C3 and connect it to C2 and the red laser generator. Again, ensuring the angels are right, when you place C3 down, the box and C2 should be flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now you can pick up the fan, and place it down on the vent just below the elevated platform where the tetromino is.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fly up to where the tetromino is, and the shield will be deactivated, letting you grab the tetromino to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's how you solve the Castle puzzle in The Talos Principle: Reawakened's new In the Beginning expansion. A few of the steps can be done differently, but it all leads to the same final shape. At least, I think it does. Let me know if you figured out a different solution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has nine Assassin's Creed games currently in development, according to a new report published by Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>We have been aware of at least four for a while.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-jade-mobile-gameplay-leaked-on-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jade</a>, the mobile game set in Ancient China, is one of only two officially announced</span>. There hasn't been any news on this title for at least two years, but Henderson says it'll be the next franchise entry to make its debut.</p>
<p>Then there's Invictus, the Fall Guys-style multiplayer spin-off. Last month, the same insider <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> this game would launch in 2025. Today, he added that Ubisoft is prepared to support it for at least five years post-launch, provided it sells according to internal estimates.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> (codenamed Obsidian) should launch around the same time, so we could be playing it in late 2025 or early 2026 at the latest.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Hexe is the other game on this list that Ubisoft has confirmed. As you might recall, a brief tease was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> during a Ubisoft Forward presentation in September 2022. This project is in development at Ubisoft Montréal and is led by Clint Hocking, a Ubisoft veteran who was the Creative Director of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Far Cry 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/watch-dogs-legion-bold-gameplay-mild-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>. It was officially described as a 'very different' franchise experience, and it does sound like it will be the next Mirage-like game. The current plan, says Henderson, is to launch it when Assassin's Creed Shadows ends its post-release support. This should happen in around two years, so Hexe could drop in 2027, with one year of planned post-launch support of its own.</p>
<p>The next big open-world Assassin's Creed RPG, codenamed Scarlet, has already entered production. Henderson speculates it might be Assassin's Creed Nebula, a game that should take place in three different settings: the Aztec Empire, India, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The roadmap gets increasingly hazy from now on. Stardust is the codename of another remake, but there's no info on which game would be remade. Then there's Emerald, reportedly another multiplayer game with a five-year support plan. Emerald is expected to be released close to Stardust.</p>
<p>'RPG 3' is completely unknown at this point, except that it should launch after the usual two years of live support for Scarlet. Similarly, the report could not add anything about 'Remake 3' other than the fact that it will release around one year after RPG 3.</p>
<p>That will be many years from now. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the year one roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works.1180317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to insider Daniel Ritchman (as reported <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/naughty-dog-125394539?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his paywalled Patreon page</a>), Santa Monica-based developer Naughty Dog quietly canceled an unannounced single-player game earlier this year. The project had been in development for over a year following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, the ambitious multiplayer game that was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> because Naughty Dog did not want to turn into a live-service games studio (after Bungie explained to them what it would mean).</p>
<p>As you might remember, towards the latter end of its development, The Last of Us Online was being directed by Vinit Agarwal, who previously worked as Game Designer on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part II. He then moved on to this unannounced project, which was still in its infancy when it was canceled. Agarwal subsequently left Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Again, according to Richtman, another unannounced single-player title is in the works at the studio. This one is further along in development, having started around three years ago. Its director is Shaun Escayg, who returned to Naughty Dog in April 2021 after a brief stint at Crystal Dynamics as the Director of the ill-fated Marvel's Avengers. Escayg was previously credited as the Lead Cinematic Animator on The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and later directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.</p>
<p>There's no further information on this game, but we might learn something more concrete in the next couple of years, at least based on the usual development timeframe of a triple-A game. Of course, the main project at Naughty Dog remains Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a brand new sci-fi intellectual property <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. This action/adventure game is directed by Neil Druckmann, the company's president and the renowned creator of The Last of Us (and current executive producer on the HBO show). Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it'll be a game where players will feel lonely, unlike most Naughty Dog titles, where the protagonist is accompanied by friends and teammates. Religion will be a central theme.</p>
<p>The game has no release date yet, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> it won't launch before 2027. It will launch on PlayStation 5 and, presumably, on PC after a while.</p>
