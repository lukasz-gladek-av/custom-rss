			<p>MercurySteam continues to share new details about Blades of Fire. In the span of a couple of weeks, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new info</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed PC system requirements</a>,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gets-lots-of-new-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and new gameplay footage</a>, and now there's a fresh interview with Gamereactor in which studio co-founder and game director Enric Alvarez <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/724323/Forging+a+New+World+-+Blades+of+Fire+Interview+with+Enric+Alvarez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the narrative structure. While a very narrative-driven game, Blades of Fire also provides the player with agency over</span>&nbsp;how much they really want to know about this world and its characters.</p>
<p><em>It might not look like it because of the freedom the game gives you, but it's a strongly narrative-driven game, and characters are the most important thing. Because you don't have a good story without good characters. So, when writing the story, we wanted to have a certain exposed narrative through cutscenes, other characters, etc., but we also wanted to have a kind of organic narrative, depending on how proactive you are. </em></p>
<p><em>The curiosity will drive you through important bits of the story. For example, there's two mechanics that you can talk to Adso anytime. One mechanic is, okay, tell me what you know about the mission you're accomplishing. And they will tell you vague stuff because they don't know everything about that. So, you, as a player, will know what they know.</em></p>
<p><em>And there's a second layer, which is, I want to talk about specific topics to Adso. You can stop at any time and say, hey, Adso, tell me about the forgers. Tell me about the hammers. Tell me about the master forgers, or about this castle, or about this new character we just found. All this requires your curiosity and active participation. There's a lot of narrative delivered in this way. I think between both, we have something quite cohesive and interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>In Blades of Fire, most of the story doesn't come for you. You have to go for it. You have to actively pursue wanting to know more. You'll find quite crazy characters in this game that will give you a different perspective on what's going on in the game and many surprises.</em></p>
<p>This new fantasy action/adventure game by MercurySteam is slated to launch in two months and a half, going live on May 22 for PC (only on the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>The Diablo IV <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24179278/the-2-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR)</a> goes live today for a week, allowing players to test the features that will be available in the next season. By far the most interesting is the fact that after defeating certain bosses, adventurers will be able to claim some of their powers for their own.</p>
<p>Blizzard said this is an attempt to increase build variety. In total, the current plan is that 24 of Sanctuary's bosses will be supported by the feature. Various world bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (see the article for more information), and even Lilith herself are among the diabolical titans offering Boss Powers.</p>
<p>Each of their powers has two effects, a main effect and a modifier effect, that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. Players can have up to one primary and three modifier powers active at any one time. The primary boss power you equip will be the star of the show, while the modifiers are designed to enhance your chosen Main Boss Power and take it to new heights.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of the supported Diablo IV bosses and their powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss Wandering Death)</li>
