			<p>Tom Stone, former managing director at TT Games, the studio behind every major LEGO game (including the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>), has left his most recent position as chair of FuturLab (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/futurlab-releases-final-powerwash-simulator-content-update-as-all-focus-shifts-to-powerwash-simulator-2/">Powerwash Simulator studio</a>) to open Second Star Games. Stone and his new studio is going back to what he did with TT Games for nearly two decades; not making LEGO games, of course, but making games based on licensed IP, starting with Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan.</p>



<p>This all comes from a new interview with Stone on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-tt-games-head-takes-on-peter-pan">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where he discusses his tenure at TT Games and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22891555/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-has-led-to-extensive-crunch-at-tt-games/">reports of crunch that went on at the studio for years</a>, all of which came to a head with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, and the attitude with which Stone and his 17 other studio members at Second Star Games approach their work now.</p>



<p>"<em>I think we're going to take a breath and look up occasionally.</em> <em>When we were making the LEGO games, it was intense. It was blood, sweat and tears. I loved every single moment of it, but upon reflection, we could</em> <em>have made fewer games slightly better and sold probably the same number of units that we sold</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It was a pretty tough 15, 16, 17 years we had at TT. We were on a mission. We were focused. We achieved</em> <em>incredible things. Everything in life is a trade; people worked incredibly hard and the games were phenomenally successful. I don't think everyone complained that it was a tough culture. As happens, there were a number of people who justifiably and rightly said it was a tough environment; their voices were louder than the people who were saying they enjoyed working there and loved making LEGO games. Their voices weren't heard so much</em>." </p>



<p>Stone doesn't comment too much on what the studio will be working on, but does confirm what the studio's name already gives away, that they'll begin by making games based on Neverland and Peter Pan, but that's not all Stone wants his new team to do. Eventually, he wants the studio to have the same breadth of licensed titles that TT Games has.</p>



<p>"<em>The first is Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan. Once we announced the studio, we actually had quite a lot of inbound interest, asking whether we'd be interested in working on this IP or that piece of IP. Obviously, we will be selective and thoughtful. We have to be mindful that we can't do it all at the same time, but the goal is to build out a stable of expertise in this young gamer space</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Peter Pan is the fire that everyone is watching</em>, <em>while they all gather around the television together. The vision is to build a stable,</em> <em>bring the thoroughbreds in, and have everyone playing together around a screen.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Stone and his new team bring to the table with Neverland and Peter Pan-based games, and whether they'll sway closer to the kind of puzzle-platforming adventures that he used to make at TT Games, or if they'll be something entirely new. A few key members of Second Star Games are former TT Games staff who Stone says are all like-minded and on the same page about how they work together.</p>



<p>"<em>We're currently a team of 18 full-time employees. Everyone's the same. We're all in this boat together. Everyone knows each other. We don't want an HR department. Everyone is there to support one another in building this game together</em>. <em>It's going to be tough and challenging because we're setting ourselves incredibly high goals. We had a meeting last week in the studio, where we agreed on a particular design feature, which is going to be very, very challenging to achieve."</em></p>



<p>"<em>If we are not going to do stuff like that, what's the point of doing it? If we aren't going to break through and make this game truly memorable, then why bother? Everyone is on board. Everyone knows we are going to set ourselves some really, really high bar challenges, and everyone wants to do it</em>."</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.42) optimized for EA's Battlefield 6 game. The driver lands a week and a half before the launch of Battlefield 6, scheduled for October 10. Just as in the recent beta, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex. Unlike Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there won't be any ray traced effects as the developers focused entirely on performance</a>. On that note, they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited their work on optimizing the game for the Xbox Series S</a> as key to improving performance even on other platforms, PC included.</p>



<p>The new GeForce Game Ready driver is also optimized for FBC: Firebreak's Breakpoint Update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was released yesterday on all platforms</a>. FBC: Firebreak already included support for path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the space simulation sandbox game X4: Foundations received NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Frame Generation support alongside the game's 8.00 Diplomacy update. The game previously supported DLSS Super Resolution (which has now been upgraded to the transformer model) and DLAA.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios</a> launches on PC (and consoles) with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also unveiled that Project G-Assist, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-project-g-assist-makes-ai-useful-to-gamers-assists-in-game-tuning-performance-diagnostics-pc-customization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the experimental AI assistant</a> that helps users tune, control, and optimize their PCs with voice or text commands, is rolling out new updates and adding new commands for laptop users, including optimizing game and app settings for on-the-go play, controlling BatteryBoost to improve battery life while maintaining a smooth frame rate, and enabling WhisperMode to reduce fan acoustics by up to 50% by adjusting game and app settings and frame pacing.</p>



<p>Lastly, the GeForce company alerted would-be buyers to the week's latest deals for its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Super Mario is officially leaping into middle-age, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the 8-bit classic that started it all. Nintendo doesn’t have much in the way of original content to celebrate Super Mario Bros. turning the big four-oh, but they are rolling out newly-remastered versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch</a>, with an additional free upgrade available for Switch 2 owners. In the case of Super Mario Galaxy 2, this is actually the first time the red-headed stepchild of the Super Mario series has been re-released since it’s initial debut on the Wii in 2010.</p>



<p>Are Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 still out-of-this-world experiences? Or should you keep your expectations down to earth? Blast off for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To this day, there aren’t many, if any, other platformers quite like the Mario Galaxy games. The action in both titles mostly unfolds across a series of floating spheres and irregular objects, with Mario gravitationally drawn to these mini planets and asteroids. This allows Nintendo to create stages that offer full 3D freedom of movement, including some mind-bending gravity-defying stuff, while simultaneously eliminating the need for complex camera controls as the planetoids Mario explores are limited in size and move as he does.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The end result is a very fun and approachable form of 3D platforming, which, in turn, allows Nintendo to push the bar in terms of action and spectacle without overwhelming people. Mario Galaxy 2 largely sticks to the same formula, while upping the difficult a smidge and introducing Yoshi, an addition I’ve always been a bit mixed on, as I don't love the pointer-based controls for his tongue (I think Galaxy 1 is the better game overall, but your mileage may vary).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>No question about it, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are still a blast to play, although Nintendo has pushed the weirdness bar so hard with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-odyssey/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that the Galaxy games almost feel a little reserved today, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for traditional platforming with a little extra flash, the Mario Galaxy games deliver even if they do feel a bit dated in some respects in 2025.</p>



<p>The Mario Galaxy games were originally designed around a Wiimote and Nunchuck control scheme, and while a pair of Joy-Cons stand in okay, gyro aiming just doesn’t feel as good or reliable as the old IR pointer. I admit, I also miss the sheer amount of secrets and extra stuff packed into Nintendo’s newer 3D platformers – the Galaxy games can feel a bit one-note and barren in comparison at times.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Only minimal changes have been made to Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2’s gameplay, with a new Assist Mode being the only real addition -- a somewhat odd choice of focus given the Galaxy games aren't known for their overwhelming difficulty. Nintendo has also expanded the Rosalina storybook content from the original game, which is cute, but obviously not something that's going to change your experience in a major way.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was borderline miraculous what Nintendo was able to achieve visually with the Mario Galaxy games on the Wii, and the games held up well aesthetically for years afterwards, but they are starting to show their age now. These new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are actual remasters, rather than the emulated ROMs running at a higher resolution we got in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-3d-all-stars/"> Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection, although Nintendo has taken a pretty light touch here. Some textures, assets, and the UI have been updated, and on Switch 2 you can play at an uprezed 4K, but I played both the 3D All-Stars and new versions of Super Mario Galaxy back-to-back to test, and the latter was only a marginally better experience. Also, I &nbsp;swear the pointer controls actually feel better in the 3D All-Stars version of the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo is being more flexible than usual when it comes to these new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, offering both a two-game physical/digital bundle for $70 and the ability to buy each individually digitally for $40, giving those happy enough with the 3D All-Stars version of Mario Galaxy an option to just buy Mario Galaxy 2. Of course, some will question Nintendo's pricing given these are older games, but it's hard to be too terribly upset when you're getting 30 to 60 hours of high-quality platforming for your 70 coin investment. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-still-a-satisfying-star-trek"><strong>Still a Satisfying Star Trek</strong></h2>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are still great games that offer a stripped-down, streamlined, blockbuster brand of action that still stands out as unique next to Nintendo’s more recent exploratory collection-heavy 3D platformers. These new remasters do the games justice, but not a whole lot more than that, with little in the way of new content and a very light-touch visual makeover. Whether these games are for you, and in what configuration you want to buy them, will largely come down to your own personal play history with the series, but Super Mario Galaxy's skies haven't lost their sparkle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 can be bought as a 2-pack for $70, or individually for $40 each, on October 2 for Nintendo Switch. Owners of the Switch versions can download Switch 2 upgrades for free.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New PlayStation 5 Pro Revision Is Rumored to Launch With New DualSense V3 Controller]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-revision-dualsense-v3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-5-pro-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-with-new-dualsense-v3-controller.1312252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro revision is reportedly launching together with a new version of the DualSense controller, which will sport a highly requested feature, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish publication PPE</a>, the same source that correctly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 would be coming this year on PlayStation 5</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/">game's official announcement</a>, the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision will be 3% more power efficient than the current model. This information lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">what reliable leaker billbil-kun revealed last week</a> regarding the rumored new revision for Sony's current generation console.</p>



<p>According to the report, the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision won't be the only revised product launching before the end of the year. Reportedly, a new DualSense V3 controller will hit shelves this November. Replacing every controller model available to date, this new controller will come with a removable battery, which is a great addition, as this will allow users to replace the battery of the controller if it fails, extending its life considerably over the older models. This controller will also reportedly be bundled with the new PS5 Pro hardware revision.</p>



<p>Although this source has proven to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new details on the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision and DualSense controller with a grain of salt until they are officially revealed, or hit stores like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/">new base PS5 model with a smaller SSD </a>did this month in Europe. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see these new products hit shelves and learn how they improve the current hardware.</p>
