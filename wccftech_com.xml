			<p>Sony announced in its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 2025 quarterly report</a> that PS5 shipments have reached 84.2 million units. In the last quarter, Sony shipped 3.9 million PlayStation 5 consoles, slightly more than in Q2 2024, when it had shipped 3.8 million hardware units. PS5 sales remain behind those of the PlayStation 4 when launch dates are aligned, due to a variety of factors. Meanwhile, its main rival, Microsoft's Xbox, is experiencing its worst console generation in sales since the original Xbox.</p>



<p>Full game software sales also increased in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024: 80.3 million units compared to 77.7 million units. First-party sales went up this quarter, too: 6.3 million units, whereas Q2 2024 registered 5.3 million units sold. This is largely thanks to the launch of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yōtei game, which sold 3.3 million units in its first thirty-two days on the market. Ghost of Yōtei sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are also slightly behind Ghost of Tsushima</a>, but that's fairly normal as that game launched in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and had a much larger install base of PlayStation 4 consoles compared to current PS5 shipments.</p>



<p>I enjoyed the game almost as much as I did the original installment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">as explained in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might get a DLC</a>, similar to the first game, in addition to the Legends multiplayer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's scheduled to launch next year</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, in the Q2 2025 financial report, Sony revealed that the number of monthly active users (MAUs) on its PlayStation Network is up, from 116 million in Q2 2024 to 119 million in Q2 2025.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios thanked the game's community for <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a new concurrent player peak on Steam of over 700K this past weekend</a>. This morning, publisher Nexon (also the parent company of Embark) announced in a press release that the PvPvE third-person extraction shooter game has sold more than four million units across all platforms to date, making it their most successful global launch ever.</p>



<p>Lee Jeong-hun, CEO of NEXON, stated:</p>



<p><em>We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Embark Studios for achieving the most successful global launch in Nexon's history. We are deeply impressed by the enthusiasm shown by our player community and look forward to building on that excitement with our content plans, including new maps, ARC vehicles, weapons, and quests, which will be available starting this month.</em></p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a few days ago</a>, estimates from Alinea Analytics indicated that game sales reached 2.5 million units in the first week. Clearly, the game has maintained its powerful momentum in the second week on the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is the second game released by Embark Studios, which was created by some former Battlefield developers who exited DICE. Their first release, The Finals, is a competitive team-based, free-to-play first-person shooter that focuses on arena matches. After a decent launch, many players didn't stick around, and for a while, the studio was uncertain about whether to continue supporting the game. Now, though, it appears to have recovered, and Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-ceo-battlefield-6-looks-really-good-the-finals-will-be-supported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently said</a> the uplift ensures The Finals will be supported 'for years to come'.</p>



<p>Of course, with the level of success it's showing, there's no doubt ARC Raiders will be the studio's focus going forward. A few days ago, Embark introduced new map conditions, including an electromagnetic storm in Blue Gate, Spaceport, and Dam Battlegrounds, as well as a night raid in Blue Gate. The full public roadmap is available <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
