			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim Unreal Engine 5 remaster</a> is now available for download, introducing a lot of new textures to improve the unofficial remaster's visuals.</p>
<p>The new version of the mod, which can be downloaded from the developer Greg Coulthard's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Udab2K5a5X">Discord server</a>, can be seen in action in the video below by Digital Dreams, the modder who provided the new 1000 textures the unofficial remaster now features in its latest iteration. While this unofficial remaster doesn't look as good as modded Skyrim does, it's still interesting to see how some of the original game's low polygon elements fare with the lighting improvements offered by the engine.</p>

<p>While an official Skyrim remaster or remake is nowhere on the horizon, there's the chance fans of The Elder Scrolls series will soon be able to revisit Oblivion with a remaster/remake that is rumored to be in development by Virtuos, the developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that previously worked on plenty of other high-profile titles. Unofficially revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing with Phil Spencer back in 2023</a>, the remaster/remake is said to feature a lot of improvements over the original, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">combat, stealth, and interface improvements</a>. Unfortunately, the game has yet to be officially revealed, so everything about it is still up in the air, except for the fact that it was originally planned for a Fiscal Year 2022 release.</p>
<p>The latest version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Edition</a> now available on PC and consoles. It introduces some additional content over the Special Edition, which is also available on PC and consoles.</p>
