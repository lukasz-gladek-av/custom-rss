			<p>NVIDIA has released a new <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/bonsaidiorama/2025.10.07_BonsaiDioramaDemo_NvRTX_5.6.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloadable 'Bonsai Diorama' demo</a> that shows off DLSS 4, path tracing, and RTX Mega Geometry. The Bonsai Diorama demo accompanies the latest update of the Unreal Engine RTX branch (version 5.6.1), showcasing RTX Mega Geometry alongside ReSTIR PT (which just received performance and image quality improvements) and the full DLSS 4 technology suite (DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS Frame Generation).</p>



<p>If you wish to try the demo, NVIDIA says the minimum graphics card is a GeForce RTX 2080Ti, while the recommended one is the GeForce RTX 5060. Also, you should be using the GeForce driver 581.29 or newer.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also warns that the resolution and window settings can only be adjusted in the main menu, before actually launching into the Bonsai Diorama demo level. You should start the demo with full screen; if using an 8 GB GPU, start with 1080p or 1440p. If you use an 11 GB GPU or higher, try 4K resolution.</p>



<p>Once in the demo, you can toggle the user interface by pressing H. Here, you can toggle RTX Mega Geometry and Ray Reconstruction on and off and tweak DLSS Super Resolution (Off, DLAA, Auto, Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance) and Frame Generation (Off, Auto, 2x, 3x, 4x). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The main feature being showcased here is really RTX Mega Geometry, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in Remedy's Alan Wake 2 with a patch showing performance improvements</a>. In this case, though, NVIDIA focuses on the image quality benefits:</p>



<p><em>RTX Mega Geometry adds full quality Nanite geometry to the ray tracing bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). As a result, ray traced shadows and reflections no longer exhibit visual artifacts typically present with Unreal Engine 5's default behavior.</em></p>

<p>A webinar is <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/experience/elitenvidiabrill/1407606/3849291/level-up-with-nvidia?linkId=100000374605923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> for Thursday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time. Developers will be able to ask questions about the Bonsai Diorama demo and its featured technologies.</p>



<p>In other NVIDIA news, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) can now use the open-source Qwen3-8B AI model as an In-Game Inferencing (IGI) SDK plug-in. This simplifies integration within a developer's pipeline and optimizes the simultaneous processing of AI and graphics for accelerated game performance. Qwen3 enables developers to create enhanced game characters that can reason in real time through non-scripted events and respond dynamically to player inputs and contextual information.</p>



<p>Alongside the release of Qwen3-8B, NVIDIA also made several improvements to the core IGI SDK:</p>



<ul>
<li>MultiLORA adapters to quickly fine-tune model weights with minimal computational overhead</li>



<li>CUDA support for graphics with Vulkan backends, which optimizes graphics and AI workloads for accelerated performance when both are running simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer.1331920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As 2025 approaches its final months, AI becomes more and more a subject of discussion across all industries, including game development. The games industry has long utilized artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, with the veritable explosion of generative AI in the last few years and the concurrent ballooning of game budgets and development timelines, some developers have been exploring whether it could be used to reduce costs and production time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our most recent interview with independent developer Epictellers Entertainment</a> about their upcoming cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, we asked the Spanish team their opinion on the thorny matter. CEO and co-founder Richard Pillosu was crystal-clear: he'd like AI to help him with daily tasks around the house, but he doesn't really want it to touch any creative areas.</p>



<p><em>The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it.</em></p>



<p>Famous video game designer and director Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his own take on AI</a>, calling it 'a friend' that will help him stay ahead. However, he also noted that he wants AI to do the menial tasks while he focuses on the creative part, so in that regard, he is aligned with Pillosu.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we interviewed actor Feodor Chin</a>, too, who provided a similar take from his point of view:</p>



<p><em>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings.</em></p>



<p>Will the games industry be able to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to allow humans to give their best creatively without replacing jobs? That remains to be seen, but we'll continue to gauge the opinions within the industry and the various implementations of the development studios.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Release Date Announced, Arrives on Consoles and PC This December]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>
