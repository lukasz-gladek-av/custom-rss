			<p>In its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">earnings report</a> for the 2025 fiscal year, Ubisoft claims that the long-awaited Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will arrive sometime in early 2026. But that's about the only good news Ubisoft has to share about its upcoming lineup of games, as chief executive officer Yves Guillemot says that some of the company's "<em>biggest</em>" titles have had their release windows pushed back.</p>
<p>Guillemot doesn't specify which games have been pushed back, just that they are major games.</p>
<p>"<em>Additionally, after review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success,"</em> Guillemot said."<em>As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands</em>."</p>
<p>Ubisoft has already named <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">2026 as a release window</a> for the Sands of Time Remake, but now we know to expect it before the end of Ubisoft's current 2026 fiscal year, which means sometime between January and March 2026.</p>
<p>But if you were waiting for games like The Division 3 or the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">Splinter-Cell Remake</a>, you could be waiting until 2028 to play either of those. Especially in the case of Splinter-Cell, since that series has been practically dormant for years already. It wouldn't be surprising if Ubisoft kept pushing it back to instead focus on keeping its bigger series like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed fed before finally getting around to giving Splinter-Cell the spotlight once again.</p>
<p>At least Prince of Persia: Sands of Time fans have something to look forward to, and with Summer Game Fest around the corner, it's possible we'll get our first look at the game soon.</p>
