			<p>Humanoid Origin, previously known as Humanoid Studios, a Canadian game developer founded years ago by Casey Hudson (former director of the Mass Effect trilogy), has been shut down due to lack of funding. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> today on the game's LinkedIn page:</p>
<p><em>Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down. Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations. Weâ€™re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. </em></p>
<p><em>In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey.</em></p>
<p>The team, which had offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Kelowna, British Columbia, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=humanoid+studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making</a> a multiplatform triple-A sci-fi game, which made perfect sense since Hudson had such experience in the setting. He was also the Game Director of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (which is supposedly getting a remake at some point).</p>
<p><em>At Humanoid Origin, our mission is to deliver magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe &amp; supportive environment.</em></p>
<p>While Hudson's project fell through, there's another big triple-A sci-fi game from former BioWare developers on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, in development at Archetype Entertainment, founded by James Ohlen and Drew Karpyshyn. The game has big Mass Effect vibes, although it has its own twist with the time dilation mechanics that promise great consequences for each choice made by players during their missions.</p>

			<p>If you're dipping your toes into the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular MOBA</a>, League of Legends, you'll notice that there are a few roles for you to try out in Summoner's Rift. If you want to try your hand at jungling, you'll need to get to grips with the best routes for clearing, how to gank your opponents, and how to shot call on essential things like taking the Dragon or doing Baron Nashor. However, before you can think about that, you need to choose a jungler. Here are some of the best junglers to choose from if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out more of our League of Legends guides here:</p>

<h2>Best Beginner Junglers in League of Legends</h2>
<p>Jungling can be quite tricky to get a handle on, especially as you are responsible for maintaining your health, mana and dealing enough damage to kill jungle camps efficiently on your own. On top of that, you have to juggle responsibilities such as warding, having a good lane presence, and overthrowing the enemy jungler. If you want to try your hand at being a jungler, here are some of the best for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Amumu</strong> is a great jungler to start with, regardless of what season it is. Not only does he have a lot of ganking capability, but he has a relatively smooth camp clear. Typically, with Amumu, you start at Raptors using your E so that you don't have to get a leash from either the top or bottom lane. This means that the lane that would be helping you doesn't miss out on vital early-game minions, and you can get your early-game camps with minimal issues. Amumu has great crowd control, with his Q stunning the enemy and pulling Amumu to the opponent, and his Ultimate stuns everyone who is in the circle.</p>

<p><strong>Nocturne</strong> is incredibly fun and has the potential to snowball and hypercarry if you play him correctly. He can be a bit difficult to get to grips with, but he has a ton of potential. It would be best if you found the balance between getting farm and ganking lanes to be able to be a threat to the opponent. One of the keys to being able to be a good Nocturne is using your Ultimate to gank an ally and help them pick off their lane opponent. Getting those assists in any time your Ultimate is up is key.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sejuani</strong> also has a lot of potential this season and is relatively easy to learn. If you don't like the idea of being a squishy jungler, Sejuani is perfect to pick. She gets quite tanky and can survive team fights and lane ganks with ease, especially with the aid of her crowd control. Of course, like any jungler, you need to make sure you find the balance between farming and ganking. However, she has a lot of defensive options with her knockback, her Ultimate, and the slows that come with it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No matter the season,&nbsp;<strong>Vi</strong> remains viable. She has a lot of damage potential and is more of a bruiser than a tank jungler. She has great damage output and camp clear, with added mobility in her Q. With how her Ultimate and Q work, it makes it easy for Vi to gank a lane. However, due to the skill shot nature of her Q, it can be difficult to land the hit on a champion, especially if they move unpredictably. Despite that, Vi is a lot of fun and has great potential if she can get ahead.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best beginner junglers you can try out in League of Legends right now. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>
