			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 4 missions from Act 1</li>
<li>All 6 playable characters</li>
<li>Experience core aspects of the game (MIssions, Relationship Building, Town Building</li>
<li>Upgrades, Crafting)</li>
<li>Unlimited playthroughs</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours of gameplay per campaign</li>
<li>Local and remote co-op play</li>
</ul>
<p>GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, both of which were recently reviewed on Wccftech. The other highlight is undoubtedly inZOI, which features the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and ray tracing, both available to GFN Ultimate tier subscribers. The game also marks the debut of the NVIDIA ACE technology through the so-called Smart ZOI NPCs, powered by a 0.5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs exclusively on GeForce RTX hardware. inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches tomorrow in early access</a>.

			<p>Mario Kart 9 may not be an instant smashing success on Nintendo Switch 2 due to the incredible popularity its predecessor still enjoys today, according to former Nintendo of America employees.</p>
<p>In a new video, former Nintendo of America employees Kit and Krysta discussed the next entry in the series, which was the only game shown during the brief Nintendo Switch 2 reveal back in January, saying that it may have a hard time matching the success of Mario Kart 8, at least in the beginning, due to how successful the game is and how it continues to be an extremely popular game due to the support it has received for years after release. Given how difficult it may be for a kid, for example, to convince a parent to purchase a brand-new system just to play Mario Kart 9, which may not look that different from its predecessor to the uninitiated eye, the two former Nintendo employees think that it will be difficult for the game to do better than the 75 million copies the game sold to date combining the sales of the original Wii U release and the Deluxe Switch release. An amazing result, considering how the Switch port was almost an afterthought after the sales of the Wii U release, which were far from amazing.</p>

<p>While much of the Nintendo Switch 2's launch success will likely rely on Mario Kart 9, it's unlikely the new entry in the series will be the system's only<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/"> first-party launch title</a>. Thankfully, we will finally learn more about what else is in store for the new system next week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will get additional content for free sometime in May, the game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543353138838503653?l=english"> Dev Note post</a> detailing the game's very first balance patch, Creative Director Junho Lee confirmed that a free DLC content update will be released sometime in May. As the new content is still in development, more details will be shared once it's closer to completion. Additional updates featuring some unspecified improvements will also be released in the near future, some of them as early as next week.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new The First Berserker: Khazan balance patch was released today to mark the game's official release following a few days of early access. As part of an effort to keep the game challenging yet fair, the developers introduced some balance adjustments, which include increased damage for the Greatsword Brutal Attack skill, a resource cost adjustment for the Phantom: Heatwave Spear skill, some boss balance adjustments, such as reduced difficulty for the Viper and Maluca boss fights, increased power of certain bosses that felt weaker than they should have, improved benefits for Easy Mode and more.</p>
<p>While I found The First Berserker: Khazan to be a balanced game overall, I had very little doubt that the Maluca boss fight would be adjusted following release, as it was one of the most difficult bosses in the game, requiring excellent knowledge of all the defensive options the game has to offer. Hopefully, these balance adjustments will help more players get into the game, as it is an action RPG that is more than worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/"> review.</a></p>
