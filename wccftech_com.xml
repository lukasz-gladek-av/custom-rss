			<p>Following the Black Friday GeForce NOW promotion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discounted</a> premium tiers (Performance and Ultimate) by 50% for three-month subscriptions, NVIDIA has announced another promotion that will run through December 50. The discount is the same (50%), but it will now be applied to new monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames will be supported by GeForce NOW on day one. Owners of the Ultimate tier will be able to activate all the technical bells and whistles, such as NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. By the way, the game's official requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>The other big weekly addition to GFN is Path of Exile 2, which debuts tomorrow on early access. Our Francesco De Meo had this to say about the action RPG following a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-off preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-lower-end-ps5-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored PlayStation 5 handheld will unlikely be able to play PS5 games natively and will probably require dedicated versions of new games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">&nbsp;rumors</a> regarding Sony's return to the handheld market following the PS Vita, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> made some interesting observations on what the systems could actually be, highlighting how it will not be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, as what is currently achieved on a 200 watts system will be impossible to achieve on 20 watts system even in a few years down the road. As such, scaling down games will be required to get games to run on the system, similar to how the Nintendo Switch handles running games in handheld mode. Sony already showed how scaling up is entirely possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ultimate-comparison/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, so scaling down shouldn't be impossible.</p>
<p>The real question is how scaling games down will be handled by this PlayStation 5 handheld. The Microsoft handheld, for example, may be similar to how things are handled for the Steam Deck and similar systems due to the company's approach, letting the user tweak the graphics settings of the PC version of games to get games running decently. In addition, Microsoft could use the Xbox Series S profile available for all their games to get them to run decently on their handheld without leaving the user to configure settings. Sony, on the other hand, doesn't have a lower-end PlayStation 5 model, so the handheld would require dedicated versions of games, while older games would need to be patched in order to run on the system. As such, the PlayStation 5 handheld could be the PS5 lower-end system that Sony currently doesn't have that will offer a slice of what the base model offers in terms of visual fidelity and potentially backward compatibility.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation Handheld Is Real... But Will It Really Run PS5 Games?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh3lAfsKdrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the current reports suggest that this PlayStation 5 handheld is still far from release, so it will be a very long time before we can see what it will be capable of and if it will ever be able to put a dent into the Nintendo Switch's popularity, whose concept of home console and handheld all-in-one system will likely only get more popular with the release of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/">yet-to-be-revealed</a> successor.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 Slavic-inspired Medieval Village tech demo is now available for download, hinting at how <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/">The Witcher 4</a> could look.</p>
<p>The demo, whose regular version can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSL9vdiQYMJmn0cq5PNjBxBK5hEHXD4r/view">here</a> and the NVIDIA DLSS version <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxD3QoDPIErPv4WZUcazq2Csd7HmS1Rd/view">here</a>, was developed by Scans Factory and features a variety of atmospheric lighting scenarios that are a great fit for any fantasy setting with a dark-leaning tone like The Witcher series. In case you cannot experience the demo on your system, you can watch it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>In the past few months, Unreal Engine 5.4 has been used to power some impressive tech demos, such as another demo by Scan Factory. This demo features an i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-unreal-engine-5-4-ultra-realistic-rome-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpressive recreation of Rome</a>, which looks downright incredible with its attention to detail and how it manages to capture the spirit of the Eternal City.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">5.5</a>, which brings some new features that promise to be game-changing, such as MegaLights, which allows developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights to scenes without any constraints. You can check out how some of these features can be used by taking a look at an impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-unreal-engine-5-5-remake-download/">Zelda: Ocarina of Time fan made</a> remake demo powered by the engine.</p>

			<p>20 years after its original release in Japan, Bandai Namco's Tales of Rebirth is finally getting an English translation patch this month.</p>
<p>As recently revealed by <a href="https://www.lifebottle.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Bottle Productions</a>, a team of dedicated fans who released last year a full English translation patch for what is, in my opinion, the best entry in the series, Tales of Destiny: Director's Cut, the translation patch for the PlayStation 2 version will be released sometime in December. Yesterday, it was specified on the team's official Discord server that they are aiming to have it out on the game's anniversary on December 16th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good morning, Twitter! We've got some big updates today. Our Tales of Rebirth (PS2) translation will be releasing sometime NEXT MONTH! Stay tuned for more info! Also, we made a bluesky for all of you who want to follow us outside of Twitter and Insta <a href="https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o">https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o</a> <a href="https://t.co/djSz9c0RsG">pic.twitter.com/djSz9c0RsG</a></p>
<p>â€” Life Bottle Productions (@LifeBottleProd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeBottleProd/status/1857417668669718704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tales-of-Rebirth-English-patch-release-date.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides offering an English translation for Tales of Rebirth, which was never released outside of Japan, the Life Bottle Productions patch will also include some advanced features that will improve the experience, such as battle subs dynamically positioned on screen depending on how many items are obtained at the end of a battle or if the player is cooking, as highlighted by some screenshots by Julian Lightfellow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">More Tales of Rebirth refinement. End of battle subs are now positioned dynamically, depending on how many items you get, or if you're cooking. (And I'm cooking!)</p>
<p>Who's excited!? ðŸ˜ƒ <a href="https://t.co/PUwts0OBCc">pic.twitter.com/PUwts0OBCc</a></p>
<p>â€” Julian Lightfellow (@JLightfellow) <a href="https://twitter.com/JLightfellow/status/1864030187093905498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tales of Rebirth is among the PlayStation 2 entries in the series that were never released in the West and probably never will, seeing as Bandai Namco seems more interested in bringing more recent entries in the franchise on modern platforms. Next month, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-graces-f-remastered">Tales of Graces F</a> will make the jump to PC and current generation consoles, complete with a variety of enhancements, such as auto-saving, the ability to turn off enemy encounters, improved visuals, and more.</p>
