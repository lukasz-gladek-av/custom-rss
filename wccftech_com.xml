			<p>According to two reliable leakers for news about Apex Legends, the long-awaited Titanfall 3 is not dead, and it is currently in the works at Respawn.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_/status/1907780125996745064">Yorotsuki</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore/status/1907780126626164993">Osvaldatore</a>, two leakers who have a solid reputation for Apex Legends leaks took to X to reinvigorate players hopes that Titanfall 3 is not lying in a ditch somewhere (or the digital equivalent on EA's servers).</p>
<p>Yorotsuki was a little clearer than Osvladatore, claiming that Respawn is working on the game and that it will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025 showcase set for December 2025. Osvladatore simply posted a graphic of the game's alleged logo.</p>
<p>The Titanfall franchise is arguably one of the best franchises in video game history that got dealt the worst hand possible. The first Titanfall game definitely wasn't perfect, but it brought a new and exciting flavor to the FPS genre that was dominated by Call of Duty and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Then, Titanfall 2 stepped everything up, and if EA hadn't aided in Titanfall 2 being overshadowed by Battlefield 1 launching right beside it in EA's effort to keep up with Call of Duty launching its annual release, Infinite Warfare, in 2016, then there's a solid chance Titanfall 2's story ends differently.</p>
<p>It still has what is regarded as one of the best single-player campaigns, not just in a first-person shooter, but in any game in gaming's history. And the rise and sustained popularity of Apex Legends continues to be proof that there's no other franchise that has mastered movement in a first-person shooter quite like what Respawn was able to accomplish with Titanfall.</p>
<p>That's just a part of what has made Titanfall 3 a topic its fans bring up nearly as often as Bloodborne fans cry out for a sequel or remake, and why Respawn's chief executive officer, and one of the original creatives behind Titanfall, Vince Zampella, has had to answer questions about Titanall 3 time and again.</p>
<p>Even though Zampella has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-id-love-it-but-it-has-to-be-the-right-thing-at-the-right-time-says-respawn-ceo/">stated that the studio is not working on Titanfall 3</a>, the reality of the video game industry, of which EA is no exception, is that things can change on a dime. Just last month, another multiplayer FPS game Respawn was<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> incubating was canceled</a>, so it's entirely possible that the cancelation of that project has led to Titanfall 3 being kicked up again, which is where today's rumor comes from.</p>
<p>There are plenty of unknowns here, but crazier things have happened during The Game Awards than a franchise that's beloved by millions coming back from the dead.</p>

			<p>Nintendo's presentation for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2 included many surprises</a>, but the brand-new open-world Donkey Kong game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was arguably the biggest surprise of all.</p>
<p>That is why I was very intrigued to check out the gameplay that would be shown during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream event. The event showcased several of the games revealed during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct, including Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p>If you want to say that it's just Donkey Kong getting the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, you'd be only sort of right. Yes, in technical terms, it is a 3D platformer, and yes, you do have a little pal along with you for the journey that's a new character for the series. Donkey Kong appropriately gets a little odd-looking talking rock as his companion, rather than a hat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkNm2wmpyto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what makes this more than just Mario Odyssey swapped out with Donkey Kong is DK's ability to smash everything and anything around him. The game's surrounding terrain is entirely moldable, with the ability to smash new paths on either side of you, above you, and below you. DK might not have the platforming prowess of Mario, but he makes up for it by being able to entirely re-shape the world he inhabits.</p>
<p>The gameplay shown off in the Treehouse livestream shows how you can not only destroy the surrounding terrain, you absolutely should be smashing the world around you to bits as often as you can. It also shows off a few DK-specific movement abilities that still let him retain some of the fluid movement Mario enjoys.</p>
<p>It's still ultimately just a vertical slice of a much larger game, but the Treehouse livestream makes clear that there's more to Donkey Kong Bananza than just being a game where Donkey Kong gets the Super Mario Odyssey treatment.</p>
