			<p>Yesterday, Bethesda Game Studios released a Fallout 76 update that includes a major revamp of the C.A.M.P. feature, which allows players to build their own home bases within the game world.</p>



<p>The enhancements have been detailed in an official developer preview by Fallout 76 Game Director Jon Rush:</p>



<p><em>We wanted to create an update that empowers our amazing building community by making it easier to build and giving you more tools to build with. C.A.M.P. Revamp features a revised workshop menu that streamlines navigation, allowing you to build quicker than ever before. We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories, such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights. An equally exciting addition within C.A.M.P. Revamp is that we're getting rid of our building restrictions regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free place anywhere. We see and hear you, Sky Campers. These changes allow you more freedom than ever to build in Appalachia. And to really show off our wonderful community's creativity, we'll be kicking off a series of exciting monthly camp building competitions later this year with huge prizes.</em></p>

<p>As with any decent patch, though, C.A.M.P. Revamp doesn't actually improve just player bases in Fallout 76. For example, the Caravan event has been modified to ensure that players will get rewarded if the Brahmin is alive, even if they do not complete the route. The event now also has a maximum duration of seven minutes. </p>



<p>Item locking has been introduced as a means to prevent accidental scrapping of important items. Moreover, the developers (who have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-new-content-double-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working alongside Double Eleven</a> for several years now) have pushed a new batch of combat balancing tweaks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improving the manual aiming experience.</li>



<li>Improvements to the V.A.T.S. formula.</li>



<li>Providing significant buffs to melee and ranged weapon damage.</li>



<li>Boosts to damage-over-time effects.</li>



<li>Increases to weapon ranges.</li>
</ul>
