			<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">we've known the release date</a> for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom last month</a>, pre-orders were not live, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">before last night, we were still in the dark on price</a>. Well, now we know the price with the base Xbox Ally model coming in at $599 USD and the more powerful Xbox Ally X model listed at a whopping $999 USD. But even with those eye-watering prices, the handhelds are selling out across the globe, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>"<em>The hype is real!</em>" Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1971477401944326215">boasted in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>ROG Xbox Ally X preorders are sold out on the Xbox Store worldwide. You can still grab yours at asus.com/store/ or find a local retailer on xbox.com.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, it should be pointed out that this is just the first batch of pre-orders selling out. We don't necessarily know how many units Microsoft made available, so this isn't exactly a sign that the handheld is due to sell millions of units or anything like that when it launches next month.</p>



<p>But it is at least a clear sign that the early-adopting enthusiasts who are getting these pre-orders are not swayed by its price in the least. What happens after those enthusiasts all have their own, and how sales of the handhelds look within a year, will be the more telling figure.</p>



<p>Though these handhelds are made by ASUS, it's worth noting that Xbox-branded hardware hasn't exactly been selling well. Xbox Series X/S consoles have <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">reportedly sold only a little over 30 million units</a> since its launch five years ago, and new reports seem to confirm that Costco, the third-largest retailer in the world, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">has stopped selling the consoles in its US and UK locations</a>. Costco Canada seems to carry them still, but you have to wonder how much longer that will last. </p>

			<p>Mars First Logistics is a physics-based sim-game developed by Shape Shop and published with support from Outersloth (the publishing and creator fund arm of <a href="https://wccftech.com/among-us-vr-release-window-trailer/">Among Us developer Innersloth</a>) that lets you build your own Mars rover to run around the red planet on. After more than two years of early access, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/">officially out with the launch of its v1.0.</a></p>



<p>The game first launched in early access on June 22, 2023, and the v1.0 launch adds a new area for players to explore, 10 new endgame contracts, support for seven additional languages, new parts for your rovers, and more.</p>

<p>Beyond just building your own rover to trot around Mars on, you'll spend your time transporting various cargo across the face of the planet and trying not to topple over from the planet's awkward terrain on the way. You'll also make a home on Mars with your own shelter that you can build up and expand while you tinker and tweak your rover with well over 100 parts to mix and match.</p>



<p>It's a strong week for physics-based games, with Mars First Logistics' launch following the release of Baby Steps from the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Interestingly, Baby Steps was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">one of the indie titles that got out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a> when it was initially set to release just ahead of Silksong. Now, it's launched right next to a game that it actually has more direct competition with, as they're more aligned genre-wise. </p>
