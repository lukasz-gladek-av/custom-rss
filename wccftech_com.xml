			<p>Developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have shadowdropped Descenders Next on Steam in Early Access, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and it's available through Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Announced in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/4362384060822219438?l=english">August 2024</a>, Descenders Next is RageSquid's follow-up to Descenders, which launched in early access a little more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/most-anticipated-sports-racing-2019/">seven years ago</a>, and reached more than 35 million players across consoles and PC. Descenders Next moves the series beyond extreme mountainbiking, with snowboarding and mountainboarding as the next frontier for players to conquer. </p>

<p>RageSquid boasts that Descenders Next "<em>already features as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore."</em> If you're not playing it on Xbox Game Pass, then you can grab Descenders Next for $29.99 / £24.99 / 28.99 euros on Steam and Xbox. </p>

<p>The studio also says that the game will feature "<em>a more natural experience</em>," with procedurally-generated "<em>off-piste</em>" mountains that will be tied together by parks made by the development team, rather than having procedurally generated tracks or hand-crafted ones, as was the case in Descenders.</p>



<p>RageSquid is also determined to make Descenders Next the last word in extreme sports games, "<em>slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</em> What those sports will be and when they'll be added remains to be seen.</p>



<p>No More Robots and RageSquid did not provide an update as to when Descenders Next will arrive on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/descenders-next-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc">when it was announced last August</a>, the studio did say that it was "<em>likely</em>" to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, and that it would be coming to PlayStation "<em>at a later date</em>."</p>

			<p>Game mechanics are the things players are usually talking about when they talk about the gameplay in a video game. Finding fluidity to the mechanics, even introducing new ones, can make a game stand out among the hundreds of games released each year. However, for iconic game director Fumito Ueda, the director behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-still-on-the-way-though-financing-isnt-secured-yet/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Ico, and The Last Guardian, game mechanics, or new ones, at least, are part of a bygone era of video games.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over-claims-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-ueda/">VGC</a>, in an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">DefamicoGamer</a>, Ueda made the comment while talking about Katamari creator Keita Takahashi's latest game, To a T. "<em>I don’t remember exactly why I replied with a ‘like’ at the time, but I was probably thinking, ‘the era of game mechanics is over. I wonder if we are no longer in the era where we need to provide new devices or new game mechanics every single game."</em> Per VGC, Takahashi claims that Ueda has been spreading this particular gospel for years, specifically since Thatgamecompany's Journey released in 2012.</p>



<p>Ueda added, "<em>Even if the mechanics are not new, you can focus on the feel and art. Whether you like it or not, it’s better to sharpen the existing mechanics."</em> </p>



<p>What qualifies as a 'new' game mechanic is ultimately going to be subjective for players and game developers, but it's difficult not to see Ueda's point when you consider how difficult it can be to introduce something truly new to modern players. Art style, game feel, game narrative, and how fluidly all those elements are woven together are what can make games feel new, even if nothing about the individual parts is new. </p>



<p>Lies of P, for example, is a game that borrows plenty from other games. Customizing weapons isn't a new game mechanic, but how its weapon customization weaves into the rest of the game, in terms of its art, combat, and narrative, all help make the way Lies of P does weapon customization feel new for players.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant element of this insight into Ueda's view of modern video games and game making is the fact that we know he's working on a new project. Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/">The Game Awards</a> last year with an intriguing trailer, this unnamed project already felt like a callback to Shadow of the Colossus, and it'll be interesting to see where else those similarities lie, and how Ueda chooses to sharpen game mechanics in his next game.</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model may have already been prototyped, as the alleged mid-frame of this system is available for purchase on a Chinese marketplace.</p>



<p>As spotted on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, a user on Xianyu, China's largest second hadn marketplace, is selling the <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949354611120&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949354611120.2219551622872">midframes</a> of an<a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949406620126&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949406620126.2219551622872"> alleged Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model</a>, which have been <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949005279175&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949005279175.2219551622872">produced in 2024 </a>as a production sample, and are identical to that of the launch model with the exception of lettering on the side and the silver and white color of two of the midframes on sale. While there's nothing that indicates if these are really a production sample for a future Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model, the user has a lot of items on sale that are likely sourced from production factories, such as blank PlayStation 5 PCBs, spare original Switch and Switch 2 parts and more, so there's the chance that these shells are still legit, even if they are not meant for an OLED model. At the very least, they could indicate that more color variants for the new generation Nintendo system are being prototyped and could be coming at a later date.</p>



<p>Although an OLED display would bring some issues, especially for VRR, the Nintendo Switch 2 would greatly benefit from a better display, as the one featured in the launch model leaves much to be desired. Shortly after launch, it became evident that the display's quality is below average, has disappointing HDR support, and is worse than its predecessor's display in terms of motion quality. As Nintendo is likely aware of these issues, seeing a new model with a better display launch only a few years after the original model wouldn't be surprising.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
