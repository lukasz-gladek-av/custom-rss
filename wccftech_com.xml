			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-turn-based-tactics-game-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Tom Henderson revealed that Ubisoft is developing a turn-based tactics game set in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the report</a>, this game is expected to launch in 2026 or 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and 'possibly' Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Henderson's sources mentioned that it will feel a lot like XCOM, albeit with more cinematic cutscenes and the like. Players will select operators with different skill sets based on the current mission. The campaign is said to last between 25 and 30 hours, though that could change since the development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of the most successful Ubisoft games in the last decade, and it's still being updated, so it's not surprising that the publisher is doubling down on the IP. It was also handpicked alongside Far Cry and Assassin's Creed to be handled separately as part of the new subsidiary that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> recently with the financial help of Tencent.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be overhauled</a> with X, a new version featuring improved graphics and new gameplay elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>
