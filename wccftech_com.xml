			<p>The console war between PlayStation and Xbox is as old as time, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. While it has been a financially rocky period for both PlayStation and Xbox, Xbox certainly suffered more than its competitor. However, an analyst in the gaming industry has shared that they think that Xbox is actually doing pretty well for themselves and has a bright future ahead of them.</p>
<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director of games at Circana, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/despite-a-rocky-couple-of-years-analyst-reckons-xboxs-console-war-is-actually-looking-pretty-bright-if-you-look-at-the-playstation-sales-chart-you-see-a-lot-of-microsoft-on-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about Xbox's history and what is in store for them in the future. According to Piscatella, if you look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/">overall sales</a> and what is going on in the PlayStation sales chart, you may find that there is a fair amount of Microsoft on their charts. He says that for Xbox to be successful, they need to branch out to embrace other platforms instead of competing against them, which will boost their sales considerably.</p>
<p>"You can look towards the future and some of the things they've talked about; expanding the reach of the Xbox brand well beyond the Xbox console is a key initiative, and they're executing on that."</p>
<p>2024 was their most obvious attempt to date regarding moving away from their console and branching out and funneling money into other money makers. For example, Xbox started to promote Game Pass pretty heavily. While for a lot of companies, subscriptions don't particularly do well, Game Pass has a lot of potential as it allows those on PC and Xbox to access games for a fixed price, giving them access to triple-A titles and indie games.</p>
<p>While Game Pass is important to Xbox, Piscatella believes that they need to balance out their approach to Game Pass and their other services, rather than honing in on it so heavily.</p>
<p>"I think it has a really nice role to fill in a portfolio of products being offered to consumers. But perhaps the previous strategy of going all in on just that, course correcting them seems to have been a good decision."</p>
<p>Their competitor, PlayStation, made obvious efforts last year to work on putting some of their games on other platforms, instead of keeping them as a console exclusive. So far, this has worked tremendously in their favor. Games such as Helldivers 2 have been massively successful across both PC and PlayStation 5. When it comes to exclusives, Xbox doesn't really have that many on offer that players are desperate for, and as a result, they are trying to be more aggressive in getting Xbox titles shipped to other platforms to ensure the most profits.</p>

			<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1874763185238274517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874763185238274517%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a Chinese app, NetEase's free-to-play third-person hero shooter game Marvel Rivals will add the Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) to its playable roster next week. The launch is reportedly happening on Friday, January 10.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched last month to great player figures <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and consoles. Overall, the game has already passed the mark of 20 million players engaged across all platforms, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked highly</a> on player charts in the United States for the final week of the year. So far, the game includes the following playable heroes (and villains):</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Doctor Strange</li>
<li>Groot</li>
<li>The Punisher</li>
<li>Hela</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Mantis</li>
<li>Peni Parker</li>
<li>Magneto</li>
<li>Magik</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Scarlet Witch</li>
<li>Star-Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Luna Snow</li>
<li>Hulk</li>
<li>Namor</li>
<li>Adam Warlock</li>
<li>Jeff the Land Shark</li>
<li>Thor</li>
<li>Black Widow</li>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Cloak and Dagger</li>
<li>Hawkeye</li>
<li>Iron Fist</li>
<li>Moon Knight</li>
<li>Psylocke</li>
<li>Squirrel Girl</li>
<li>Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
</ul>
<p>With the leaked addition of the Fantastic Four, the roster would grow to 37 playable characters, and that's just in the first season of the game's live service. NetEase no doubt has a lot more characters planned to add in the coming months and years, provided that Marvel Rivals continues to do well. While the current list already includes the most popular heroes and villains, there's still a lot of characters left to introduce from the vast universe built over the past eighty years or so. Just off the top of our head, Deadpool, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kingpin, Green Goblin, Drax, Gamora, Nebula, Ghost Rider, Ant-Man, Luke Cage, Agatha Harkness, Miss Marvel, Red Guardian, Vision, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, and Sabretooth are just some of the potential upcoming entries.</p>

			<p>Native emulation of PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 could become a reality in the future, as the possibility is reportedly being researched and prototyped.</p>
<p>Developer Implicit Conversions, the studio handling the PlayStation Classics ports on PlayStation 5,&nbsp;<span>lists on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> a roadmap&nbsp;</span>that it is researching and prototyping the possibility of a PlayStation 3 emulator package for Syrup, the engine that powers the other PS Classics ports. The "Dreaming About" tag, however, suggests that native PS3 emulation could be years away.</p>
<p>As of now, the PlayStation 3 Classics games available on PlayStation 5 with a PS Plus Premium subscription are only playable via cloud gaming, but there's little doubt that the current generation system from Sony is more than capable of emulating PS3 games natively. A test conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/">last month</a> using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, confirmed how the PS5 hardware would have little trouble running emulated PS3 games, as tested games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well and at a higher than native resolution, even with some hardware limitations, such as memory limitations caused by some driver issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, PlayStation 5 users can enjoy a selection of PlayStation 3 games via cloud gaming as part of the PS Plus Premium subscription. More information on this subscription can be found <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">here.</a></p>
