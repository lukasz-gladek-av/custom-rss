			<p>Amazon Prime Video has given the green light to a Life is Strange TV series, a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-luckychap-1236509181/">Variety</a> has revealed. It'll be written by Charlie Covell, the same writer recently behind Netflix's show Kaos and the Channel 4 mini series Truelove. Covell will also act as executive producer and showrunner, while Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson will tag along as executive producers through Story Kitchen. Square Enix is also listed as one of the producing entities alongside Story Kitchen, Amazon, and LuckyChap, but neither <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">Deck Nine</a> nor <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Dontnod</a> seems to be involved.</p>



<p>It's the latest videogame to TV series adaptation Amazon has in the works, adding Life is Strange to its list alongside its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a> TV series. Similar to some of the aforementioned adaptations, there have been multiple attempts at making a Life is Strange adaptation work in some way, with Amazon Prime Video finally being the one to close on a deal.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazon MGM Studios has greenlit Life is Strange, based on the critically acclaimed best-selling video game, straight to series from creator/showrunner Charlie Covell.</p><p>Square Enix, Story Kitchen, and LuckyChap set as producers. <a href="https://t.co/r595wGEVRx">pic.twitter.com/r595wGEVRx</a></p></div>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/1963995557673796088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>On the part of Story Kitchen, Johnson and Goldberg said, "<em>Story Kitchen has always believed that ‘Life is Strange’ deserved to be more than just a game—it’s a cultural touchstone</em>. <em>After a decade-long journey, we’re honored to be bringing this beloved story to Amazon MGM alongside our incredible partners at Square Enix, our brilliant showrunner/writer Charlie Covell, and the amazing team at LuckyChap. Together, this thoughtfully assembled dream team is ready to share Life is Strange with the world in an entirely new way!</em>"</p>



<p>For Covell's part, they added, "<em>It’s a huge honor to be adapting ‘Life Is Strange’ for Amazon MGM Studios</em>. <em>I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike</em>."</p>



<p>Square Enix External Studios co-studio heads Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton added, "<em>For years we’ve had so many people asking us to create a ‘Life is Strange’ TV show and we’re so pleased to finally partner with Amazon MGM Studios who we trust will do an incredible job bringing our universe to life</em>."</p>



<p>With its setting, gameplay, and narrative focus, Life is Strange is a clear candidate for adaptation fodder in what's been a renaissance for videogame to TV or movie adaptations in recent years. So far, Amazon has only proven itself with its Fallout series, and with so many other adaptations in the works, not just at Amazon, it's worth asking when people will start feeling fatigued from all these adaptations, especially if the quality bar on them takes a drastic drop. </p>

<p>The cast was confirmed in the style of Street Fighter 2, with each of the cast members in their respective places for their characters in the character select screen. </p>



<p>"<em>Secrets don't last long in the arena - Street Fighter is now in production</em>," a post from the <a href="https://x.com/Street_Fighter/status/1963677608887095624">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the film reads. "<em>In theatres October 16, 2026."</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The full cast stars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Andrew Koji as Ryu</li>



<li>Noah Centineo as Ken Masters</li>



<li>Callina Liang as Chun-Li</li>



<li>Joe "Roman Reigns" Ano'i as Akuma</li>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film is set in 1993, with the plot kicking off by Chun-Li convincing Ryu and Ken to get back into the arena for the World Warrior Tournament. Unsurprisingly, there's more to the tournament than meets the eye, a fact that begins to reveal itself as the tournament goes on.</p>



<p>On the film, co-chair of Paramount Pictures, Josh Greenstein, said, "<em>Legendary has built a reputation for ambitious, globally appealing films, and we’re excited to be partnering with them.&nbsp;Street Fighter&nbsp;is the perfect start to our collaboration, which we believe will be strong and lasting</em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the world of fighting games being made into movies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-2-movie-trailer-debut/">the next Mortal Kombat movie</a> is premiering this coming October 24, 2025. It'll be interesting to have the Street Fighter film to compare it to a year later. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During a livestream for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk">Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</a>, of all things, a director on the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series at Square Enix, Tetsuya Nomura, provided a couple of small updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 and Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. </p>



<p>Translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nomura doesn't go into any great detail, and is only able to comment on their development progress, with both games, according to Nomura, being "<em>on schedule</em>." He even goes on to say, per Aitaikimochi's translation, that Square Enix has a date picked for when they'll announce Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, asking fans to "<em>please wait for it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So, regarding Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, you see, Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis. We are making great progress on the game, and I can't say anything else...We are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it.</em>"</p>



<p>He offers the same update for Kingdom Hearts 4, but doesn't imply that Square Enix is close to any kind of reveal or that it has a date picked out for the next big drop of Kingdom Hearts 4 news.</p>



<p>"<em>On that same note, I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4. We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I translated Nomura’s quote from the FF7EC stream regarding FF7 Remake Part 3 and Kingdom Hearts 4.</p><p>Both games are making great progress. They have already decided on when they will make the big announcement for FF7R Part 3, so stay tuned!</p><p>Here are the subs for his comment! <a href="https://t.co/Immgd4FtW3">pic.twitter.com/Immgd4FtW3</a></p></div>— ☆オードリーAudrey☆ (@aitaikimochi) <a href="https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's been a little more than three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/">announced</a>, and you can add Tetsuya Nomura's words here to the list of very small updates we've gotten for the game in the time since, while we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-english-recording/">seen a few</a> more <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">significant updates</a> on how Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing. That said, hopefully, the fact that Square Enix has a reveal date picked out means that we can forget about last year's report that we'll have to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-may-be-four-years-away/">wait until 2028 to close off this remake trilogy</a>. Unless the date it has picked is in 2027, of course.</p>
