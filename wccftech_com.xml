			<p>Running games powered by the Unreal Engine 5.4 smoothly continues to be a challenge even for current high-end GPUs, as an RTX 4080 GPU has trouble running an undemanding fan-made game powered by the engine at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, <a href="https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3</a>, a fan-made project powered by the latest public version of the engine, cannot run at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Quality preset even in scenarios where there isn't a lot happening on screen. With other DLSS settings and Frame Generation, performance is considerably better, but this is only making it more clear that a native 4K, 60 FPS experience is not possible on the vast majority of current gaming hardware, although better optimization, which shouldn't be expected for a small fan-made project like this, could have improved the situation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3 on Unreal Engine 5.4 | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bs2XrBrpbBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One more thing the video above makes abundantly clear regarding Unreal Engine 5.4 is that, despite performance improvements over past versions, the engine still leaves plenty to be desired in regard to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame time stability</a>, as the stutters are pretty evident at all resolutions. This has been a persistent issue in games powered by Epic's engine for a long while, and there still doesn't seem to be a solution to the problem in sight, although things may improve in the future thanks to the effort of developers well-known for their technical expertise, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>

			<p>Just before the release of Dragon's Dogma 2 in March, franchise creator Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-wants-to-make-something-new-after-dragons-dogma-2-which-is-as-long-as-the-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to make something wholly new and original for his next project. Fans certainly thought he meant at CAPCOM, but the veteran game director surprisingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> the Japanese company at the end of August after a career of thirty years. His credits at CAPCOM also include Power Stone, Auto Modellista, and multiple Devil May Cry games, including the critically acclaimed latest entry.</p>
<p>Today, we finally learned what's next for the maker of Dragon's Dogma 2. Tencent's LightSpeed Studios <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1856139854574432387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Itsuno is the new Head of their Japan Studio. He'll work on triple-A action games. The latter is no surprise, as that's what Itsuno has done for most of his career, though the same can't be said for choosing LightSpeed, which is not a household name in the industry yet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, LightSpeed is gathering momentum to achieve great things. Two and a half years ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-to-jin-yong-is-an-upcoming-ue5-aaa-open-world-game-from-tencents-lightspeed-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> off Code: To Jin Yong, an impressive-looking open world roleplaying game made with Unreal Engine 5 and set in a Wuxia-inspired world. While we haven't heard more info on this game since that reveal, another LightSpeed team based in Los Angeles <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-sentinel-is-a-gorgeous-open-world-game-set-in-dystopian-sci-fi-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> an equally gorgeous open world game called Last Sentinel during last year's The Game Awards. This one will be set in a dystopian sci-fi version of Tokyo. A few months ago, LightSpeed LA also <a href="https://wccftech.com/lightspeed-studios-unveils-new-performance-capture-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new state-of-the-art performance capture facility, showing that budget isn't too much of an issue at this stage.</p>
<p>Based on the news announcement, it sounds like Itsuno will be coordinating the efforts of the global teams, but that doesn't mean he won't eventually create a new project of his own. Personally, I'd love it if he would gather feedback about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2's shortcomings</a> and try to improve upon the formula, which had definitely stagnated quite a bit in the sequel, in a spiritual successor.</p>
