			<p>The rumored upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro revision is reportedly launching together with a new version of the DualSense controller, which will sport a highly requested feature, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish publication PPE</a>, the same source that correctly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 would be coming this year on PlayStation 5</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/">game's official announcement</a>, the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision will be 3% more power efficient than the current model. This information lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">what reliable leaker billbil-kun revealed last week</a> regarding the rumored new revision for Sony's current generation console.</p>



<p>According to the report, the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision won't be the only revised product launching before the end of the year. Reportedly, a new DualSense V3 controller will hit shelves this November. Replacing every controller model available to date, this new controller will come with a removable battery, which is a great addition, as this will allow users to replace the battery of the controller if it fails, extending its life considerably over the older models. This controller will also reportedly be bundled with the new PS5 Pro hardware revision.</p>



<p>Although this source has proven to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new details on the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision and DualSense controller with a grain of salt until they are officially revealed, or hit stores like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/">new base PS5 model with a smaller SSD </a>did this month in Europe. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see these new products hit shelves and learn how they improve the current hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the original rumor</a>, Electronic Arts (EA) confirmed yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it is indeed getting a $55 billion buyout</a> from a Consortium of investors that includes PIF, Saudi Arabia's sovereign investment fund, Silver Lake (an American global private equity firm), and Affinity Partners, an American investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of current United States president Donald Trump.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has started to settle, though, the first reports from reputable sources suggest that there might be massive layoffs on the way at EA, and it's not just history suggesting that after what happened with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. According to a paywalled report <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the Financial Times</a>, the investors from the aforementioned Consortium are planning to use the latest AI advancements to cut EA's operating costs and manage its substantial debt, suggesting a potential shift towards incorporating AI in games and therefore reducing manpower, both when it comes to development teams and acting talent.</p>



<p>Speaking about that debt, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg's report</a> reveals that this deal is partly funded by $20 billion in debt sourced by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This is the most significant debt commitment ever registered for a buyout. Moreover, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonschreier_ea-agrees-to-55-billion-sale-in-largest-activity-7378438808637243392-QqT5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a LinkedIn post from Bloomberg's Schreier</a>, they will be put on the books of EA:</p>



<p><em>That will mean a significant amount of cost-cutting. I would expect mass layoffs, more aggressive monetization, and many other measures. The interest alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per year. For context: this is nearly four times as much debt as the Toys R Us LBO, and I think everyone knows how that went.</em></p>



<p>This is very worrying, especially for EA employees. One studio that might be targeted in case of mandated cost-cutting measures is BioWare, which did not deliver a financially successful game with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Canadian developer already suffered some layoffs and, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had fewer than a hundred employees left</a>. Hopefully, they will get one last chance with the next Mass Effect game.</p>



<p>Former CEO and co-founder of analyst firm SuperData, Joost van Dreunen, also chimed in on the massive $55 billion deal, the second biggest in gaming history (after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard) and the biggest buyout of all time, topping the $48.4 billion buyout of TXU Energy in 2007. <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his SuperJoost Playlist Substack newsletter</a>, the games analyst focused specifically on PIF. The Saudi Arabian private investment fund already owned roughly 10% of EA's shares, which made their part of the transaction less onerous. Even so, the analyst says their strategy is to 'throw staggering amounts of money at establishing market dominance', and given that they have nearly infinite investment resources, it may well succeed. </p>



<p>Van Dreunen also posits that private companies are generally better insulated than public companies when it comes to market pressure, so the new owners of Electronic Arts could technically forego short-term profits in favor of the long-term view. However, PIF is not the only one in the Consortium - Silver Lake and Affinity Partners may hold a different mindset.</p>

			<p>When CAPCOM announced that Resident Evil Requiem would also be released on the Nintendo Switch 2, several fans expressed doubts about how the game would run on the console, which is notoriously less powerful than all its current generation counterparts. However, some off-screen footage from last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game running quite smoothly</a> on Nintendo's latest gaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Japanese website Famitsu</a> during the Japanese gaming convention, CAPCOM's Game Director Koshi Nakanishi admitted that even the developers were surprised at first to see Resident Evil Requiem running that well on Nintendo Switch 2. Nakanishi credited much of the result to the RE Engine.</p>



<p><em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly. We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, elsewhere in the Famitsu interview, Game Producer Masato Kumazawa said that the TGS 2025 demo stations offered Nintendo Switch 2 and laptop PCs as options. Indeed, if Resident Evil Requiem runs smoothly on the Nintendo Switch 2, we expect it to do the same on a wide range of computers, though CAPCOM hasn't shared the official PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We do know that the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC</a>. Presumably, other upscalers will be supported as well, like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Intel XeSS, but they haven't been officially confirmed yet.</p>
