			<p>Japanese developer and publisher <strong>CAPCOM</strong> has enjoyed a strong stock run today, closing <strong>up 9,82%</strong> over yesterday. Investors were pleased with <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company's third-quarter financial report</a>, which showed a 30% increase in net sales, a 75% increase in operating profit, and a 65% increase in ordinary profit. The current fiscal year's net sales after Q3 are $753 million, with $355 million in operating profit and $338 million in ordinary profit.</p>



<p>The full-year forecast is even better, given the imminent launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> (on February 27, 2026) and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> (on March 13, 2026). Both games will be released before the end of CAPCOM's fiscal year, which is scheduled for March 31, 2026. With their help, <strong>the publisher is targeting net sales of $1.2 billion</strong>, operating profit of $477 million, and ordinary profit of $458 million. </p>



<p>That's just the beginning of the publisher's calendar year. For the next fiscal year, CAPCOM already has two potential heavy-hitters: the third-person action/adventure game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRAGMATA</a></strong> (an interesting new IP, based on our Gamescom hands-on) and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a></strong>, the long-awaited new installment in the Onimusha franchise. The former is launching on April 24, 2026, while the latter still doesn't have a final release date.</p>



<p>Of course, CAPCOM also continues to bet on the solid performance of its catalog titles. This fiscal year, <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> was the top performer, likely due to deep discounts. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> hasn't performed very well, but it still reached <strong>11 million</strong> total units sold since its launch in February 2025. Even with the recent sales slowdown, <strong>it's the studio's fastest-selling game to date</strong>, narrowly beating its predecessor, <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong>, which took a little longer to get to 11 million units sold.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>25/12 (Millions)</strong></td><td><strong>Lifetime (Millions)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></td><td>2.43</td><td>11.00</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></td><td>2.34</td><td>12.26</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></td><td>2.28</td><td>13.59</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></td><td>1.69</td><td>6.36</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</strong></td><td>1.68</td><td>16.47</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 2</strong></td><td>1.46</td><td>16.87</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></td><td>1.10</td><td>18.27</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resident Evil 3</strong></td><td>1.09</td><td>10.99</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</strong></td><td>1.03</td><td>10.91</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></td><td>0.99</td><td>11.10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Perhaps the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PC performance patch</a> will reignite interest in Monster Hunter Wilds. Otherwise, it might be difficult to beat Monster Hunter World's total record sales of <strong>over 22 million units</strong> sold to date.</p>
