			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> founder and creator <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong> has just released <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an explosive interview to GamesBeat</a>, in which he doesn't mince words against <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s current strategy and also shares his opinion of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly appointed Xbox CEO</a>, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>. According to Blackley, who first came up with the idea of a Microsoft console back in 1999, her mandate will be the same as a palliative doctor, ultimately sunsetting the whole division as Microsoft refocuses on its new core AI business.</p>



<p><em><strong>Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted</strong>. They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, <strong>her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] The natural consequence of the focus on AI is that AI abstracts every problem from the minds of the executives who believe in it. We’re abstracting the problem of games as well. <strong>There’s a core belief, and you can see it in what Satya said, that AI will subsume games like it will subsume everything</strong>. The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI. That’s what you’re seeing here.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing. <strong>Microsoft is a company that is now about enabling its customers by enabling AI to drive things. That’s at odds with the auteur model of any art, but specifically of games</strong>. Microsoft doesn’t have the problem that Apple does, or that Netflix does, where they have an auteur-driven content model to manage. Games are the only place where they have a content business.</em></p>



<p>His fears are compounded by the fact that Asha Sharma <strong>previously served as president of Microsoft's CoreAI product portfolio</strong>. It doesn't help that some gamers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already accused her of using an AI bot to interact with followers on X</a></strong>, though she rejected those accusations, and she previously stated that she doesn't want to flood the Xbox ecosystem with "soulless AI slop".</p>



<p>Xbox gamers have been mostly worried about Microsoft sunsetting its console hardware business, <strong>which is definitely a more real concern</strong> given dwindling sales and the multiplatform strategy. At this stage, it seems a little premature to think about the whole division being axed, though of course, it could still happen at some point in the future. For now, though, Microsoft <strong>is still planning to release a new Xbox console</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possibly next year</a>.</p>

			<p>South Korean developer and publisher <strong>KRAFTON</strong> announced another step toward expanding its AI R&amp;D framework: the appointment of <strong>Kangwook Lee</strong> as the company's new Chief AI Officer (CAIO). Lee has actually been at Krafton since 2022 in the role of Head of KRAFTON AI; the promotion is a sign of the company's continued investment in AI research and development. As a reminder, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company has been calling itself "AI First"</a></strong> for a while now.</p>



<p>Lee has already led major initiatives, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collaboration with NVIDIA to develop CPCs (Co-Playable Characters)</a></strong>, AI-driven companions designed to enable real-time interaction between players and in-game teammates. Those debuted in KRAFTON's life simulation game<span>&nbsp;<strong>inZoi</strong>, featuring the so-called <strong>Smart Zoi</strong> NPCs, which can adapt to the environment and respond to events</span> around them.</p>



<p>Soon, the technology will also be introduced in PUBG with the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> system, built on NVIDIA ACE technology and running an SLM (Small Language Model) on-device. <strong>PUBG Ally NPCs can discuss strategies with players and adapt their playstyle accordingly</strong>. The NPCs can bring over requested items, assist in reviving teammates, and make independent decisions during looting, combat, and survival situations. They also work with voice-based interaction and already support English, Korean, and Chinese, with the first tests planned early this year in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>.</p>



<p>Under Lee’s leadership, KRAFTON’s AI strategy will focus on three core areas:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Elevating gameplay:</strong> KRAFTON will continue developing AI features to enhance immersion, responsiveness, and player interaction. <strong>Technologies such as CPCs complement human-designed gameplay systems, enabling studios to maintain full creative ownership and final decision-making authority</strong>. AI will be applied where it meaningfully enhances the player experience, while preserving the handcrafted elements that define each title.</li>



<li><strong>Supporting development teams:</strong> KRAFTON is investing in AI tools <strong>to help streamline repetitive or technical tasks, enabling developers to spend more time on creative planning, storytelling, and design</strong>. The company views AI as a means of <strong>supporting its workforce by reducing friction in production workflows and empowering teams to focus on their craft</strong>. AI-driven analytics and development tools operate using authorised and responsibly managed data in accordance with applicable privacy standards.</li>



<li><strong>Exploring long-term research opportunities:</strong> Building on its experience operating large-scale physics-based virtual worlds, <strong>KRAFTON is conducting long-term research into physical AI and robotics</strong> through a newly established entity, <strong>Ludo Robotics</strong>. This entity has operations in the United States and Korea. This research is in the early stages and focuses on software intelligence, using simulation environments to test and validate complex systems. <strong>Games remain KRAFTON’s core business</strong>, though, and future research initiatives are designed to build on the company’s foundational strengths in interactive technology.</li>
</ol>



<p>Most gamers still aren't on board with this, as evidenced most clearly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the controversy sparked by Larian's usage of AI in the development of Divinity</a></strong>, but KRAFTON appears to have chosen its lane without much hesitation. Only time will tell whether they made the right move.</p>
