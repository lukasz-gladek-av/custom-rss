			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the game featured in December's IGN First, so fans of the upcoming first-person open world action roleplaying game can look forward to new content and reveals throughout the whole month. To start with, IGN posted the first 43 minutes of gameplay, which were taken from the PC version of the game. You can watch them in the embed below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still based on Crytek's CryENGINE technology rather than switching to the far more popular Unreal Engine by Epic Games. During <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat with Martin Klima</a>, we asked him why. Here's what he had to say on the subject:</p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>

<p>Warhorse Studios still hasn't shared the game's system requirements. However, they did share that the game can run smoothly even on relatively low-end machines, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling in the first official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 live stream:</p>
<p><em>We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year, we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing, and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is slated to release on February 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
