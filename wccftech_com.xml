			<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40353">Famitsu</a>, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-shares-new-ghost-of-yotei-details-as-the-games-non-linear-campaign-is-explained/">VGC</a>) Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Cornell, both co-creative directors on Ghost Of Yotei, spoke about the Yotei's non-linear campaign, the game's story, and a bit more about the setting, and the research Sucker Punch did while crafting Yotei.</p>
<p>Last week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">release date trailer</a> provided a few quick story details, like how the game centers around new protagonist Atsu's quest for revenge, which Fox reiterates in the interview here.</p>
<p>"<em>The main theme of this game is revenge. The main character, Atsu, has a big trauma in her childhood and goes on a journey to get revenge,</em>" Fox said.</p>
<p>Fox also described the game's map, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yotei has the greatest freedom and biggest map of any open-world game we have ever made</em>."</p>
<p>More interestingly, Fox and Cornell talked about the immense research they did on the studio's second attempt to capture Japan, how the studio collaborated with experts on Japanese history, and, of course, went to the Hokkaido prefecture, where the game is set.</p>
<p>"<em>We have received cooperation from various advisors regarding the depiction of the Ainu people and Ainu culture of the time. Like with the previous game, we have also thoroughly researched Japanese culture and incorporated it into this project,</em>" said Fox.</p>
<p>"<em>I also went to Hokkaido to research Ainu culture,</em>" Cornell added,&nbsp;"<em>and had people knowledgeable about Ainu culture introduce me to museums and folk crafts, which I incorporated into the worldview of this work. By the way, I also went to the mountains with them and had the experience of picking wild vegetables</em>."</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to arrive on PS5 this coming October 2, 2025, and while it'll surely be its own game compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, there are more than a few striking similarities between the two. The plot, for one, sticks out as a considerable similarity as they're both focused on tracking down several people who have wronged the protagonist.</p>
<p>Gameplay will surely be a big differentiating factor, but overall it'll be interesting to see how both games shape up by the time we've played Ghost of Yotei.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-handheld-mode-resolution-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will be among the Nintendo Switch 2 games releasing in the system's launch window that will hit the maximum resolution offered by the system's screen, according to new information.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Japanese company <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/feature/magazine_2025special/sp/index.html?page=2&amp;device=sp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the digital version of its Nintendo Magazine 2025 Special Issue focused on the new system. While most of the information included in the magazine is not new, we did get on page 12 the confirmation that Donkey Kong Bananza will run at up to 1080p resolution, 60 FPS with HDR in handheld mode. Considering launch titles usually don't take full advantage of a new system, this is definitely impressive, although a more thorough analysis will be needed to see how often the game will indeed run at 1080p and how stable the 60 FPS target will be.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza feels like a new beginning for the character and its franchise, although the game is not a reboot, given Cranky Kong's presence. Besides featuring a new design for the iconic character, the game plays a lot differently from its predecessors, as Donkey Kong can now use his fists to destroy the environment. You can learn more about how these new mechanics shape the experience in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/"> preview.</a></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-8-0-two-more-exclusives/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a variety of enhancements that should improve emulation of different games.</p>
<p>The 0.8.0 version, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.8.0">here</a>, doesn't come with any major new feature like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-7-0-amd-fsr-hdr-download/"> 0.7.0 version</a>, which introduced AMD FSR and HDR support, but it still packs a lot of technical core, libraries, GPU, shader recompiler, and GUI enhancements that should provide some welcome improvements to emulation in different games.</p>
<p>Even before the ShadPS4 0.8.0 version was released, some emulation improvements were already added to the PlayStation 4 emulator in work-in-progress versions. These improvements allow the emulator to run two additional PS4 exclusives, the racing game Driveclub and the open-world game InFAMOUS Second Son, although both games are not exactly in a playable state with visual issues and bad performance, as highlighted in the videos below shared by BrutalSam. Still, considering how Bloodborne went from barely launching on the emulator to being playable from beginning to end in just a few months, it shouldn't take too much time for the emulation of both games to improve, and allow PC players to experience two more games that are unlikely ever to get officially ported.</p>

<p>By making Bloodborne playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator opened the doors for modding projects that improved what is still one of the best games released by FromSoftware. Among these is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/"> Remaster Project by fromsoftserve</a>, which introduces visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>
