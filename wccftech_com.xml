			<p>The PlayStation 5 SDK is getting updated in the near future with a new low energy mode which strongly hints at a handheld system.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, Sony is briefing developers and sending out documentation on a new low energy mode for the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, which is getting added soon to the system's SDK. This new mode is a third flag, or performance profile, besides the base mode and Trinity mode for the PlayStation 5 Pro which indicate which system is supported by a game, and comes with plenty of limitations: it limits the system to eight threads, reduces 3D Audio processing to 75%, reduces the GPU core clocks by around 10%, 20%, essentially forcing them to the minimum clock speeds required to run a game, and GDDR6 memory bandwidth by half, limits the systems to 36 compute units, and removes PSSR and VR support. All of these limitations reduce power consumption by around 20% and 30% while keeping 90% of the console's capabilities without breaking backward compatibility. Interestingly enough, the documentation provided to developers encourages them to have proper VRR support.</p>

<p>While a reduction of the PlayStation 5 power consumption would be welcome in a variety of situations, this likely isn't the primary goal of this new low energy mode, according to Moore's Law is Dead. The introduction of this new flag is probably the beginning of handheld support, and framing it like this would be a means to prevent leaks. Known AMD leaker Kepler L2 also believes this new energy-saving mode is an emulated performance profile for a handheld system, since the biggest weakness of that APU is memory bandwidth, which is one of the things the new performance profile addresses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Oh this is 100% an emulated performance profile for the Handheld, since the biggest weakness of that APU is memory bandwidth and this profile is reducing PS5 bandwidth in half as you said.</p>
<p>— Kepler (@Kepler_L2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_L2/status/1931134328710513013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As of now, this new PlayStation 5 low energy mode is not mandatory for developers, but the fact that it is being added soon suggests that something is indeed cooking up at Sony. Trinity Mode, for example, was added roughly one year before the PS5 Pro launched and made mandatory a few months later, so its addition suggests that the device related to this performance profile could be coming relatively soon. It has been rumored for a while that the home PlayStation 6 will launch together with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">handheld device</a>, and with the next-generation system getting closer to release, it makes sense to start planning support soon.</p>

			<p>Atomic Heart's Mundfish had a third announcement at SGF 2025 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Heart II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a>: it will publish ILL, an intriguing survival horror game developed by Team Clout, headquartered in Cyprus. This is part of the new Mundfish Powerhouse publishing label <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Set in a mysterious research facility, ILL is a realistic first-person action/horror game that plunges players headlong into an immersive, atmospheric body horror narrative. Players can expect&nbsp;innovative gameplay mechanics, including a cutting-edge dismemberment system, binaural audio implementation, and realistic physics. ILL is a tribute to and an evolution of the survival horror genre.</p>
<p>Grotesque monsters can be mutilated and mercilessly torn apart. Ripped flesh, exposed bone, disemboweled bodies – all this will make an unprecedented impression and shock players. The binaural audio system aims to amplify the emotional impact.</p>
<p>Enemies are unpredictable, and the game's realistic physics makes the environment more than<br>
just a background. It becomes an active part of the gameplay of ILL, including during puzzle-solving.<br>
The player's actions can affect the behavior of monsters and cause unexpected reactions, from<br>
impulsive interaction with the surroundings to disturbingly human-like reflexes.</p>
<p>Players will feel the weight of weapons in their hands with elaborate animations that reflect their unique physical properties. Not only is precision necessary, but so is the maintenance of a diverse<br>
arsenal: checking for malfunctions, installing modifications, and upgrading. Strategic inventory<br>
management is critical to survival, as the ability to craft an item could literally mean the difference<br>
between life and death.</p>

<p>Some of Team Clout's developers have previously worked on horror movies like V/H/S/Beyond, Longlegs, IT: Welcome to Derry, and Azrael, which explains the game's cinematic vibe. ILL doesn't have a release date yet, but it can be wishlisted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Mundfish CEO Robert Bagratuni said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mundfish Powerhouse is proud to announce our partnership with Team Clout on their upcoming title, ILL. Powerhouse was created to empower daring, visionary developers by providing meaningful support where it matters most. We’re committed to backing artists with bold, transgressive, and uncompromising creative visions - and we believe ILL is a striking example of that spirit.</em></p>
