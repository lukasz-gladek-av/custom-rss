			<p>This morning, Finnish developer Remedy Games <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the half-year financial report, admitting that FBC: Firebreak did not perform well. We already knew that, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-has-surpassed-1-million-players-though-remedy-knows-theres-a-lot-of-work-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of one million players</a> was highly misleading since the game was available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to the respective subscribers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the majority of the players were on those two platforms, whereas the Steam launch 'underperformed' compared to the studio's hopes:</p>



<p><em>The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</em></p>



<p><em>Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.</em></p>



<p>With that being said, it was not all doom-and-gloom from the Remedy executive, who noted that FBC: Firebreak was always meant to be a live, evolving game. The studio now thinks it has a solid foundation to expand on, with the next major update scheduled to go live in late September.</p>



<p>On the bright side, Control's lifetime sales have now surpassed five million units. Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained full control of its publishing, distribution, and marketing rights in February 2024</a>, so the sales now go only to the Finnish developer. Alan Wake 2 continues to sell 'steadily' and accrue royalties, according to Virtala, who then switched to an update on the studio's upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Control 2 (which is being made <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a smaller budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) is on track to meet its next milestones, which will be focused on gameplay, environments, and missions. The studio wants the game to have a strong commercial offering when it launches. The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake also made steady progress; during the last quarter, Remedy built on the momentum established earlier in 2025 while collaborating closely with IP owner Rockstar Games. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>

<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>
