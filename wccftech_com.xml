			<p>Back in November 2024, a year after the PlayStation Portal first launched in November 2023, PlayStation pushed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">Cloud Streaming Beta in a firmware update</a>. Now, yet another year later, a device that everyone would have understandably assumed would support Cloud Streaming from launch (but for some reason did not) now has official Cloud Streaming support, as PlayStation confirmed today that streaming your digital library of games already compatible with streaming is now available to all PS Portal users who are also subscribed to PS Plus Premium.</p>



<p>A new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog</a> goes through the features that PS Portal owners can now take advantage of, and the many caveats around cloud streaming on your device. Those caveats being that you can only use cloud streaming if you are subscribed to PS Plus Premium, which as a reminder is the highest of the three PS Plus tiers.</p>



<p>You can also only use it for a select number of digital games in your library. Not every game you have may be available for cloud streaming, as that availability can differ based on region. That said, there are thousands of games available to be streamed, so while <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">you can check out this list of games available for cloud streaming here</a>, chances are what you're looking for is up to be played over streaming.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Along with the feature exiting its beta stage, users who have been testing out the beta will see a few changes. Firstly, for all PS Portal users, today's update offers a new remote play home screen. There's also a new home screen for when you're on the page to play your games over streaming. The search screen now also helps you identify if a game is available to be played over streaming.</p>



<p>Remote play and cloud streaming users also now get full 3D audio support, and there's a new network status screen to help you better gauge your internet connection strength if you happen to be experiencing issues while playing. Also, if you're concerned about someone using your PS Portal when you're not, you can now add a passcode lock to your device.</p>



<p>Regarding cloud streaming-specific updates, you can now access accessibility options like screen readers and adjusting the size of the text on screen, game invitations will work properly while playing a game over streaming, and you can make in-game purchases while streaming your games.</p>



<p>It's a good day for PS Portal users who have been waiting for this to be official, but it feels worth noting that it is almost insane to see a feature that should have come with the device only officially arrive two years after it has been on shelves. </p>



<p>Not that PlayStation doesn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-system-update-adds-support-for-basic-features-like-game-captures-to-cloud-streaming/">already have a history of adding basic features to the Portal late in the game</a>, but when the news of cloud streaming exiting beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-leak-suggests-highly-requested-feature-is-coming-soon/">PS Portal leaked just a week earlier</a>, you'd be forgiven if your reaction was one of complete surprise that it wasn't there at launch.</p>



<p>At least it's here now, and as senior manager in product management at Sony, Takuro Fushimi, says in his PlayStation Blog post, we can "<em>look forward</em>" to PlayStation "<em>sharing more updates in the future</em>."</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is going to offer something even for returning players who have completed the original PSX release or the Nintendo 3DS remake released back in 2016, a new ending that's never been seen before in any other version of the game.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Reimagined follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations,"</em>  game producer Takeshi Ichikawa told Game Informer during the publication's recent visit to Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</em></p>



<p>While Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will follow the original narrative and add a new ending, the new version of the seventh entry in the series will<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"> feature significant gameplay changes that are set to improve the experience considerably</a>. Among these changes is a renewed battle system that will power more dynamic enemy encounters, evolved party members and enemy movesets and behaviours, the ability to skip combat against weak foes by attacking them on the field, a redesigned UI with a tab-based menu system for easy navigation, and more.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, which launches on February 5, 2026, is the next series' remake to launch on PC and consoles in recent times, following the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. The latter was released last week on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, introducing new features to the first two entries in the series that update the experience without taking away their classic feel. You can learn more about the latest series' remake by checking out <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">my review.</a></p>

			<p>A Steam Deck highly-requested feature has finally arrived with a new Beta Client update that went live a few hours ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/725769023703421533">The official November 4 Beta Client update notes</a> confirm that the system now features display-off low power downloads. This feature allows the Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off mode before going to sleep. This feature is enabled by default when the system is plugged in to power, and can be toggled on and off by going into Settings and then Power.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck Beta Client update also fixes a couple of additional issues, swuch as SteamOS updates failing to respect HTTP proxy configuration and regression where the performance graph wouldn't display while streaming.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck display-off low-power downloads feature was further detailed in a dedicated blog post, which outlined the two ways to access the feature. The first way is to press the power button while the system is downloading content, which will bring up a new dialog box asking the user if they wish to continue downloading with the display off.</p>



<p>The second way is automatic, as the system will go into this mode after an idle timeout. Pressing a button after this happens will bring up a new status screen with the download progress, from where the user can either wake the system up completely or let it continue downloading in the new low power mode.</p>



<p>The new feature introduced in the latest Steam Deck Beta Client update is just one of the many improvements that have been added to the system launched in 2022, which helped kick-start the handheld PC gaming market. You can learn more about the portable system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Kai Tatsumoto's review</a>. If you already own the system and want to make the most out of it, you should also consider the Chizha Mount Ling Dock, which&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-chizha-mount-ling-dock-review/">we reviewed last month.</a></p>
