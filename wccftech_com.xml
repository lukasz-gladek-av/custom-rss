			<p>A PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature, which would allow users to purchase a game from the PlayStation Store and receive a free copy of the same game for other formats, may be on the way, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860">yesterday's report from Amethxst</a>, who discovered new icons recently added to the PlayStation Store which suggest that a cross-buyfeature could be on the way, known leaker billbil-kun posted a new report on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757">Dealabs</a>, confirming that these new icons can be indeed found on the PlayStation Network, and can be seen by inserting special characters into the "About" section of a PlayStation Network account.</p>



<p>Although the addition of these symbols is recent, the development of a PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature appears to predate their introduction. In some of the site's CSS files, billbil-kun discovered the "crossbuy-tag" tag in certain file properties, and this tag has been confirmed to have been added to the PlayStation website back in June 2025. As this isn't data from the PlayStation Vita days where some titles were released as cross-buy games for the handheld and home consoles, it definitely seems like something is indeed in the works.</p>



<p>While the presence of a PS5/PC icon seems to suggest that this cross-buy feature will allow users to get the game on either platform and receive the other version of the game for free, there's the chance that this feature could also involve the rumored PlayStation handheld, which is said will launch alongisde the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>Even if this weren't the case, PlayStation 5 and PC cross-buy would still be very interesting to see, not only for achieving parity with <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-xbox-play-anywhere-doing-well-adoption-big-third-party-publishers-will-come/">what Xbox has been offering for years</a>, but also to explore how this would work on handheld devices. Is a PlayStation PC storefront on the horizon as well? Hard to say at this time, but the possibility is definitely there.</p>

			<p>As we near the one-month mark of Battlefield 6 being on shelves, there's no denying that it has had a strong commercial launch. It sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">7 million copies in its first three days</a>, and as of the time of this writing, the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">concurrent player count on Steam has not dipped below 200K</a>. That doesn't mean it's been entirely without its issues, of course. Thankfully, EA and Battlefield Studios seem to be listening, since one of the game's biggest issues is getting a "<em>major overhaul</em>" based on player feedback.</p>



<p>That issue is, of course, the pacing of the game's progression regarding its challenges and assignments, which, when completed, move you through the battle pass, unlock weapon attachments, and in many cases, new weapons, since several weapons in your arsenal in Battlefield 6 cannot be unlocked purely through levelling up.</p>



<p>"<em>As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback</em>,<em>"</em> Battlefield Studios <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">writes in its announcement</a>. "<em>This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You might recall that it was clear Battlefield 6 had an issue with its progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">once players started to farm XP in bot-filled PvE Portal matches in droves,</a> more than what is usual in the case of Battlefield, since that ends up happening in some form for each game. EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">did its best to shut that down,</a> but thankfully, it has gone beyond that to actually trying to address the root of the problem, which is that getting anything in Battlefield 6 is too much of a grind.</p>



<p>Today's update adds over 90 adjustments to challenges and assignments, with some of the key ones being that weapon assignments for all weapon types have been simplified, and damage requirements have been reduced from 10,000 to 3,000. Mode-specific assignments have been standardized across the board; they now only require two wins per tier instead of five. Multi-kill and kill streak goals have been reduced from twenty multi-kills down to five, and challenges for each of the different classes can also be completed much faster.</p>



<p>It's good to know that EA and Battlefield Studios are paying attention to complaints players have raised about progression, and hopefully, within another month's time, we'll see the state of progression in the game in an even better spot than it is now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in November 2024, a year after the PlayStation Portal first launched in November 2023, PlayStation pushed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">Cloud Streaming Beta in a firmware update</a>. Now, yet another year later, a device that everyone would have understandably assumed would support Cloud Streaming from launch (but for some reason did not) now has official Cloud Streaming support, as PlayStation confirmed today that streaming your digital library of games already compatible with streaming is now available to all PS Portal users who are also subscribed to PS Plus Premium.</p>



<p>A new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog</a> goes through the features that PS Portal owners can now take advantage of, and the many caveats around cloud streaming on your device. Those caveats being that you can only use cloud streaming if you are subscribed to PS Plus Premium, which as a reminder is the highest of the three PS Plus tiers.</p>



<p>You can also only use it for a select number of digital games in your library. Not every game you have may be available for cloud streaming, as that availability can differ based on region. That said, there are thousands of games available to be streamed, so while <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">you can check out this list of games available for cloud streaming here</a>, chances are what you're looking for is up to be played over streaming.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Along with the feature exiting its beta stage, users who have been testing out the beta will see a few changes. Firstly, for all PS Portal users, today's update offers a new remote play home screen. There's also a new home screen for when you're on the page to play your games over streaming. The search screen now also helps you identify if a game is available to be played over streaming.</p>



<p>Remote play and cloud streaming users also now get full 3D audio support, and there's a new network status screen to help you better gauge your internet connection strength if you happen to be experiencing issues while playing. Also, if you're concerned about someone using your PS Portal when you're not, you can now add a passcode lock to your device.</p>



<p>Regarding cloud streaming-specific updates, you can now access accessibility options like screen readers and adjusting the size of the text on screen, game invitations will work properly while playing a game over streaming, and you can make in-game purchases while streaming your games.</p>



<p>It's a good day for PS Portal users who have been waiting for this to be official, but it feels worth noting that it is almost insane to see a feature that should have come with the device only officially arrive two years after it has been on shelves. </p>



<p>Not that PlayStation doesn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-system-update-adds-support-for-basic-features-like-game-captures-to-cloud-streaming/">already have a history of adding basic features to the Portal late in the game</a>, but when the news of cloud streaming exiting beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-leak-suggests-highly-requested-feature-is-coming-soon/">PS Portal leaked just a week earlier</a>, you'd be forgiven if your reaction was one of complete surprise that it wasn't there at launch.</p>



<p>At least it's here now, and as senior manager in product management at Sony, Takuro Fushimi, says in his PlayStation Blog post, we can "<em>look forward</em>" to PlayStation "<em>sharing more updates in the future</em>."</p>
