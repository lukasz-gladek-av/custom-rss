			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders was Reportedly the Best-Selling Game on Steam For November 2025, Over 7.7M Copies Sold Overall]]></title>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a> has ARC Raiders listed as the number-one best-selling game on Steam for November 2025 by copies sold, and has now reached 7.7 million copies sold across all platforms. It's the latest sign of how Embrak Studios' third-person extraction shooter continues to be one of the biggest games of the year.</p>



<p>This comes after Alinea Analytics reported that ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">had sold nearly 750K copies in the week of November 16-22</a>, and that it had sold at least half of all its copies sold on Steam, with the other half coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>It's far and away a bigger game than Embark Studios' free-to-play title, The Finals, particularly on Steam, where ARC Raiders is surpassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/">The Finals' peak concurrent player count</a> as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">part of its daily player numbers</a>. Its continued success is also interesting to follow <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">as the conversation around generative AI in game development builds and evolves</a>.</p>

<p>That said, we're still in what you'd call 'the early days' for a multiplayer game. It's up to Embark to keep this momentum going now, and we'll know by next year if ARC Raiders has truly carved itself a piece of the multiplayer shooter pie, depending on where it stands at the one-year mark.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the Steam charts, November was dominated by indie games. RV There Yet? reportedly came second behind ARC Raiders for copies sold in November 2025, with 1.9 million. Peak followed it with 1.4 million copies sold, which was then followed by Dispatch at 1.1 million, and rounding out the top five was <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-duckov-enjoys-spec-quackular-launch-with-1-million-units-sold-in-five-days/">Escape from Duckov, the Escape from Tarkov parody</a>.</p>

<p>While it's still to be determined if ARC Raiders will maintain its current spot as the multiplayer game to beat, Embark Studios can enjoy the game receiving its commercial flowers, especially since it doesn't look like it'll get its critical ones this year.</p>



<p>It missed out on Game of the Year nominations for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards</a>, and in the latter it only carries one nomination for best multiplayer game. The conversation around 2025's best game is engulfed by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We'll know which game comes out on top in just a few days from the time of this writing, with The Game Awards kicking off on December 11, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Would Appreciate It If You Could Pick It Up Again’: Monster Hunter Wilds Director Pleads With Lapsed Players to Return]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the most significant flaws of Monster Hunter Wilds when it launched earlier this year was the low challenge level offered by the launch content. The general consensus on this issue wasn't fueled by the opinion of veteran players only. Myself, a hunter far from being a series veteran, found the game way too easy, and with the launch endgame not offering anything significantly challenging, I left the game behind, returning to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak</a> for my Monster Hunter fix. However, the game's producer claims that this issue has been resolved, urging lapsed players to return to the game.</p>



<p>Speaking at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, producer Yuya Tokuda talked about the challenges of balancing the game for both newcomers and veterans. </p>



<p><em>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,"</em> said Tokuda-san.</p>



<p>Following its release in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-late-june/">Monster Hunter Wilds received multiple updates</a>, which introduced <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">additional content and a revamped endgame offering more challenges to clear</a>. While the game's update cycle has yet to be completed and there's more to come before the obligatory big expansion, Tokuda-san believes the low difficulty launch issues have been addressed. </p>



<p><em>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again,"</em> the producer said.</p>



<p>As they say, first impressions last a lifetime, so it is understandable that many completed Monster Hunter Wilds and never returned to it due to the low challenge level and, more importantly, performance issues, which have yet to be fixed to this day.</p>



<p> Hopefully, the development team will be able to improve the game further and deliver a better experience in the future, as the new open-world progression, which modernized the experience considerably, is well worth experiencing.

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Was The Biggest New Third-Party Xbox Game Pass Launch in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-biggest-new-third-party-xbox-game-pass-launch-2025/</link>
            <guid>1371739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you were looking at the calendar, the week that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass, considering the fact that this was Sandfall Interactive's debut title, and (though you may not have known it at the time) it would be competing with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, you'd be forgiven for thinking Clair Obscur didn't have a strong shot at standing out that week.</p>



<p>Not only was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Oblivion Remastered's shadow-dropping in no way a hindrance</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">but according to Xbox Wire,</a> it became, and would remain, the biggest new third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p>



<p>You might have some conspiratorial thinking around that news, thinking that Xbox started tracking this metric to jump on the Clair Obscur hype even more as we inch closer to The Game Awards and the feeling that gaming's modern zeitgeist has already dubbed Clair Obscur to be the game of 2025 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after its sweep at the Golden Joysticks</a>), but this is actually something that <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/31/palworld-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever/">Xbox began tracking only last year</a>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">Palworld became the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass ever</a>.</p>



<p>And, in fairness, considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCy6vC00O0c&amp;t=1s">Clair Obscur's appearance in January's Developer_Direct video</a> is at least partial proof that Xbox has been behind the Clair Obscur hype for a long time now.</p>



<p>The size of the launch is measured by the number of unique users who played the game within its first 30 days of availability, which means that in its first month of release, when the whole industry seemed consumed by the Clair Osbcur craze, a lot of players rushed to Xbox Game Pass to see what all the fuss was about.</p>



<p>"<em>This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it’s down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality</em>," said Sandfall Interactive creative director, Guillaume Broche, in an Xbox Wire post. "<em>It’s really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream</em>."</p>



<p>Broche also noted that Sandfall Interactive's working with Xbox and releasing on Game Pass was a key element to getting the word out about Clair Obscur. "<em>From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Letting a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before. The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year</a>, he gave it a 9.5/10 and pegged it as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Fast forward to today and not only did it sweep The Golden Joysticks, winning seven awards (including Ultimate Game of the Year), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">but it has 12 nominations at The Game Awards</a>, and could very well repeat its Golden Joysticks performance. </p>
