			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows' latest title update, numbered <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">update 1.1.1</a>, has officially gone live today, with Ubisoft adding a slew of changes ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-plus-dlc-claws-of-awaji-release-date/">Claws of Awaji</a> expansion's launch on September 16, a new story quest for players to delve into, and new Ezio Auditore da Firenze-themed cosmetics for players to acquire through a new Animus HUB project.</p>



<p>The new quest being added sees you follow Junjiro in his quest to learn more about the Bo staff and find a legendary Bo master. You get your own Bo staff at the end of the quest, while this quest is free for all players, that wasn't always the case, as Ubisoft reveals it was initially designed as part of the Claws of Awaji expansion. Somewhere along the way, though, Ubisoft decided it shouldn't lock the weapon behind the Claws of Awaji paywall, or as Ubisoft puts it in its blog post "<em>we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone.</em>" While update 1.1.1 is live now, this quest and the Bo staff will arrive alongside the expansion on September 16.</p>



<p>What is live today is a level cap increase, improved scouts, new upgrades for your hideout, enhanced gear quality, the ability to advance the time of day, a slew of bug fixes, and a new Animus HUB project called Project Sanctuary, which grants players the Ezio-themed cosmetics for you and your cat.</p>

<p>When the Claws of Awaji expansion arrives, it'll add a new island region to explore, a new faction to face, the aforementioned Bo staff, new gear, abilities, and of course, a new storyline to follow and uncover. This expansion is the final step in Ubisoft's previously revealed summer roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>Once it's out, we should start to hear what Ubisoft has planned next for the game soon, since, at least for the foreseeable future, Ubisoft will continue to support what has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">best-selling games</a> of the year so far across the industry and not just for Ubisoft. </p>

			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>
