			<p>Square Enix Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was at last week's Brasil Game Show 2025</a> to discuss Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 and the trilogy as a whole. Speaking about the decision to split the original game into three parts, he explained:</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy VII is a game with a truly huge fanbase. We could have cut some parts and turned it into one game, but the fans of the original would never have forgiven us. If we want to tell this story using new technology, it's not possible to do so in a single title. That's why we made the difficult decision to split it into three parts.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview on stage, Hamaguchi expressed confidence that the ending of the final chapter of the trilogy would satisfy both new and old fans:</p>



<p><em>Of course, I already have a clear idea of ​​the ending for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. I think this conclusion will appeal to both those who loved the original and those who became fans of FF7 thanks to the Remake series. I'm confident this new game will be loved by everyone.</em></p>



<p>Nearly a year ago, Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 would need some twist to make it a unique and exciting experience compared to the previous two. We still don't know what that will be, but we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get confirmation from Tetsuya Nomura</a> (another director on the series) that the game (and Kingdom Hearts IV, too) is on schedule.</p>



<p>Looking at the four-year timespan between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we might have to wait another two to three years before the conclusion to the remake trilogy is out. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous games are launching on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>, starting with the first chapter.</p>

			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>
