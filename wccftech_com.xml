			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">rumored Final Fantasy IX remake</a> may be in trouble, and the game could have been canceled altogether, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/post-142366968">ResetERA forums</a>, well-known insider NateDrake commented on the current status of the unannounced remake, saying that, last the insider checked, the game was still in development. However, a fresh check may be needed, as around a month ago, the insider was told the game was in trouble and possibly had been cancelled. Only one source talked about the cancellation, so the information needs to be verified first, the insider added.</p>



<p>The possibility of the Final Fantasy IX remake having been cancelled couldn't have come at a worse time, as today marks the game's 25th anniversary. Many expected July 7 would be the perfect day to announced the rumored remake, but Square Enix, however, only released a special anniversary movie, which you can watch below, to mark the occasion. You can watch the movie below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake was originally revealed via a massive GeForce NOW database leak, which revealed a lot of unreleased projects at the time. In Square Enix's case, every game revealed by the leak proved to be real, with the exception of the remake of the ninth entry in the popular JRPG series, so there's no doubt that it has been in the works at some point. Hopefully, development hasn't been canceled, and players will be able to travel across the world of Gaia with Zidane and his companions again to experience one of the best entries in the series like they never did before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Microsoft's latest round of layoffs, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw over 9K lose their jobs</a>, including many at various Xbox-owned gaming studios, former Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to explain that, in his opinion, Game Pass is one of the main culprits, not to mention potentially damaging to the industry as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Game Pass). I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by Microsoft’s “infinite money”, but at some point, reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.</em></p>



<p><em>What might happen once Microsoft has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up. Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsidized by Microsoft bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real</em>.</p>



<p>Colantonio is in tune with Rhys Elliott, Head of Market Analysis at Alinea, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that Microsoft bet on the wrong horse by putting so much effort into pushing its Game Pass subscription service. Games simply do not work in the same way as film or music since they take much longer to consume, and there's only so much spare time that users can dedicate to entertainment.</p>



<p>Anyway, Colantonio later added that Game Pass could only co-exist if it's focused on back catalogue games.</p>



<p><em>I’m fed up with all the BS they fed us at first, like “don’t worry, it doesn’t impact the sales”, only to admit years later that it totally does. “No shit it does! Really?” The only way Game Pass can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially Sony's strategy with PlayStation Plus: <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-says-playstation-plus-engagement-has-never-been-higher-still-wont-add-first-party-games-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never put big games there on day one</a>, only add them at a later date, when they enter the back catalogue phase. However, Microsoft is currently still very much keen to maintain its promise to consumers to bring all of its games to Game Pass when they launch. Even so, despite adding franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and DOOM, the total number of subscribers is believed to be around 35 million, far lower than Microsoft's lofty goals.</p>



<p>As a side note, Raphael Colantonio is the studio founder of WolfEye Studios, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird West</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;The studio is now developing a retro sci-fi first-person action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/" target="_blank">inspired by Dishonored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank">published by NEOWIZ</a>. It's not the first time Colantonio slams Microsoft, by the way—</span>that already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-founder-slams-microsoft-for-closing-the-austin-studio-explains-why-immersive-sims-arent-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following last year's decision to close Arkane Austin</a>, his former studio. </p>

			<p>According to Japanese analysts, the Nintendo Switch 2 will remain scarcely available in global stores until at least next Spring. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-Switch-2-likely-to-remain-scarce-until-next-spring-analysts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Nikkei, Toyo Securities senior analyst Hideki Yasuda and UBS Securities analyst Zhai Yijia estimate that the console's first-month sales following the June 6 launch might be around 6 million units.</p>



<p>Yasuda reckons that, even with the limited supply, the Nintendo Switch 2 could reach 20 million units sold by the end of this fiscal year (March 2026), while Yijia is a bit more conservative with his 18 million units. Regardless, these goals would outperform the original Switch by 20% to 30%.</p>



<p>Yiija is also more conservative in his long-term outlook on the console's sales:</p>



<p><em>Initial sales are higher than those of the Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5, but this should not be seen simply as an increase in demand. Those consoles suffered from semiconductor shortages at the time of their release that limited production, curtailing supply. It will be difficult to surpass the cumulative sales of the Switch.</em></p>



<p>His colleague Yasuda is more optimistic:</p>



<p><em>It is overwhelmingly popular compared to past game consoles, and consoles that have a strong initial response tend to continue to have high demand.</em></p>



<p>Market analysis firm DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would definitely keep it on track to surpass the original console over time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has commented on the Switch 2 price, with President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a> that the company is evaluating the extent to which the pricing may be a barrier for certain consumers, especially the younger ones:</p>



<p><em>We believe the pricing of Nintendo Switch 2 is appropriate for the gaming experience it offers,<br>and what is most important is to provide entertaining experiences that demonstrate the value to<br>consumers. To achieve this goal, we have incorporated various features into Nintendo Switch 2.<br>It is true that Nintendo Switch 2 has a higher price point than our past gaming systems. We are<br>creating various opportunities outside of our gaming systems for young children to engage with<br>Nintendo characters and game worlds, with one of the ultimate goals being that they will eventually<br>play on our gaming systems. We are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system<br>might become a barrier.</em></p>
