			<p>Funcom's latest update for Dune: Awakening, Patch 1.1.15.0, adds a few more significant changes to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">PvE parts of the Deep Desert the developer recently added</a>, while also pushing several bug fixes and stability improvements.</p>



<p>While most of these changes will be applied right when you download the update, <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">Funcom does warn</a> that some of them will only be applied after scheduled downtime, though it doesn't specify which changes need downtime to be applied. So best to wait until after the next instance of maintenance to expect to see all of these changes.</p>



<p>The most significant change is that tier 6 resources can now be found in the PvE areas of the Deep Desert. Prior to this update, players would have still had to brave the PvP parts of the Deep Desert for the highest tier of resources. You'll still have to head into a PvP area to find a higher density of these resources, but being able to find tier 6 resources in PvE Deep Desert areas rounds out the endgame experience for those solo players and anyone who doesn't want to engage in PvP.</p>



<p>Spawn rates for medium spice fields have also gone back up to 8 after being dropped down to 5 with the update that first added PvE zones to the Deep Desert, and the number of small spice fields has increased from 22 to 30.</p>



<p>Regarding some of the fixes introduced, the most significant fixes are the ones applied to contracts that couldn't be completed, and the issue of players losing out on rewards from completed contracts because their inventory was full. Now, players will receive their rewards for completing contracts only when there is enough space in their inventory for them.</p>



<p>In the weeks since Funcom added PvE areas to the Deep Desert, the response from the player base has been mixed. Some believe Funcom should have never implemented these changes, arguing that having the entirety of the Deep Desert be PvP was tonally correct for a survival game based on Dune. Players who don't want to engage in PvP, however, felt differently, and that even after the tens of hours they spent getting to the endgame, their time with the game was 'cut short' because they could no longer participate in endgame activities without dealing with PvP hazards. </p>



<p>Regardless of where you fall in that argument, Funcom will continue to try and find the right balance between its PvE-focused players and PvP-focused players. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing a major new feature that allows for more accurate emulation of multiple games, including FromSoftware's Bloodborne.</p>



<p>The 0.10.0 update, which can be downloaded from the emulator's official website, is packed with a lot of core, libraries, shader recompiler, GPU and GUI improvements, but the biggest improvement, as highlighted in the blog post announcing the release of the new version of the emulator, is the introduction of readbacks, which emulates the shared memory on the PlayStation 4 by reading back memory that was modified on the GPU back to the CPU side, making several games function properly. For example, with this new feature, vertex explosions in Bloodborne and other games should function properly now, as should Trico's climbing ability in The Last Guardian. However, the feature isn't enabled by default, as it is still very experimental and can create issues in games, including performance issues, and, as such, has to be enabled manually via the emulator's config files.</p>



<p>Speaking about The Last Guardian, one of the PlayStation 4 exclusives that still hasn't received an official PC port, the ShadPS4 emulator made some excellent progress emulating the game even before the launch of the new version of the emulator, as showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam</a> which also shows the great progress that's been done in other PS4 exclusives like Driveclub and Killzone Shadow Fall. All three games aren't in a perfect state yet, but the progress is nonetheless impressive, considering the game barely launched on the emulator a few weeks back.</p>

			<p>A new nine-minute clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> gameplay has debuted through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9sqrkte-QQ">IGN</a> that showcases protagonist Enzo embarking on a mission to bring in an enemy of Don Salieri alive.</p>



<p>The mission begins with a short cutscene where Enzo gets the order from Don Salieri himself, presenting Enzo with a chance to prove himself to Salieri and to the rest of the family. Enzo is then escorted to where he can gear up to deal with the "<em>pest problem</em>," which is how the members of the family refer to his assignment. Once he's chosen the proper tools for the job, we get a good look at the Italian countryside while Enzo drives to his target's home.</p>



<p>When he gets there, we get a good look at some stealth combat before all hell breaks loose and Enzo is exchanging bullets with guards, giving us a better look at the third-person gunplay in Mafia: The Old Country. Once he reaches his target, the gameplay fades out before the cutscene finishes, as Enzo knocks his target unconcious.</p>

<p>Even with this clip being cut in areas where developer Hangar 13 clearly wanted to keep things hidden, it's still the best look at gameplay we'd had since 2K and Hangar 13 started to properly showcase the game earlier this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-has-gone-gold-ahead-of-its-august-release/">Mafia: The Old Country officially went gold last month</a>, ahead of its early-August release date, as Hangar 13 works to polish what it believes will be "<em>the best-looking Mafia game</em>.<em>"</em> We'll see how well it lives up to those expectations, and the rest of the expectations Hangar 13 has set for the game, when it arrives on August 8, 2025.</p>
