			<p>In a new video released by Gaijin Entertainment, people can compare the studio's Dagor Engine, which has been free and open source since last year, with the industry-leading Unreal Engine 5 from Epic Games. The video shows off content from the East District, a part of Gaijin's unannounced game, with the content in the demo being made using both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine 5. In addition to the video, Gaijin Entertainment has also released the full code of one of Dagor Engine's multiplayer frameworks under a permissive license, along with the art sources of one of the multiplayer samples. Those interested can look at the East District demo on both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine, depending on your preference.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dagor Engine — East District" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miABl6aekBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment decided to do this to showcase the engine by asking their partners over at Hooks Creative Studio to create an FPS map that was inspired by iconic maps of the past. This map was built by the team at Hooks Creative Studio totally from scratch, using Megascan and modern Photogrammetry assets on Unreal Engine 5. Once this was done, they then continued by moving the map over to Dagor Engine, which is now being used in their unannounced game. Gaijin Entertainment has said that it's beneficial to have it in both Unreal Engine and Dagor Engine, as they can use it for comparison and use it as an internal validation of the existing Dagor technology.</p>
<p>Gaijin found that the Dagor map runs faster while providing an equal or superior (subjectively, they admitted) visual fidelity. The map uses state-of-the-art technologies, such as real-time global illumination and advanced anti-aliasing. While it doesn't use vendor-specific performance-enhancing techniques such as DLSS, XeSS, or FSR, Dagor does support all of them. <a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/demos-of-a-new-gaijins-game-showcase-dagor-engine-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaijin has said that the Dagor demo</a> operates in native resolution in most configurations, while the Unreal Engine version does not, which helps demonstrate the performance of the Dagor Engine.</p>
<p>The company admits that they can't compare them fully, as the Unreal Engine version of the demo has the potential to be further optimized by experienced developers. However, by releasing both versions of the demos, they hope to encourage developers to explore using Dagor Engine in more of their projects. This engine powers titles such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-ceo-interview-we-wouldnt-have-launched-war-thunder-on-steams-current-state/">War Thunder</a> and Enlisted.</p>

			<p>Today is Dragon Age Day, and BioWare is celebrating the yearly event with a few gifts for the community. To begin with, they have finally released the free Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator as a standalone app available on all platforms. Fans had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-might-be-released-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> it before launch to get a head start on creating their characters, but the developers couldn't release it in time. It's now out there, though, and everyone will be able to download the character creation tool, make their characters, and then import them into the game.</p>
<p>BioWare also prepared a special image that collects some of the Rooks shared by the community from the game's launch to this day. The picture shows the great diversity available in the character creation tool.</p>

<p>There's more. Today, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting its fourth update, introducing a new tool to take photos of the game's cutscenes, over 20 bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions.&nbsp;For Dragon Age Day 2024, BioWare has also released a free armor, body paint, and nose blood smear based on Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. Owners of Dragon Age: The Veilguard can find the new cosmetics in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing the mission 'The Singing Blade.' Check out a preview below.</p>

<p>BioWare has released a few infographics detailing some of the choices made by the players in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. For example, in the first real opportunity to choose the fate of a character, 42% left Mayor Julius of D'Meta's Crossing to drown in Blight, while 36% saved him. The remaining 22% banished him to the Grey Wardens. Notably, this option was only available to Grey Wardens Rooks, which partly explains the lower percentage. It's also by far the best option (and the one I picked in my playthrough) since Julius later has his own redemption by helping save a group of Grey Wardens in the Hossberg Wetlands.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours, to properly cap off Dragon Age Day, a few members of the development team will also participate in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit AMA</a> (Ask Me Anything) session to answer questions from the community.</p>
