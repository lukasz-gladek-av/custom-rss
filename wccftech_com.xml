			<p>It's been a little less than two years at the time of this writing since Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/">confirmed</a> that it was making a movie adaptation of The Legend of Zelda, which means nearly two years of fans around the world discussing who they'd pick to play the titular Zelda, and everyone's favorite mute protagonist, Link. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, we learned when the movie would be out in theatres, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/">initially pinned</a> with a March 26, 2027, release date. Last month, however, Nintendo announced that it would no longer be out in March 2027, and shifted the date a few weeks into May, with the new date set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">May 7, 2027</a>. </p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">statement</a> from Nintendo president Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo has announced who will be playing Zelda and Link in the live-action adaptation. For Zelda, it'll be 21-year-old Bo Bragason, while 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth is stepping into the tunic of Link.</p>



<p> "<em>This is Miyamoto</em>," the statement began. "<em>I am pleased to announce that for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason-san, and Link by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san. I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen</em>."</p>

<p>The images shared already appear to be showing them as their characters, with Bragason in a blue top reminiscent of Zelda's classic blue dress, and Ainsworth in a dark tunic, though it's not necessarily the bright green that players would recognize as distinctly part of Link's costume. </p>



<p>As a fact of their age and the number of credits listed on each of their IMDB pages, both actors are early in their careers, making the roles they'll play in this film the most prominent parts they've had so far. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the cast is developed around them, and the direction Nintendo takes with this film, the more we learn about it.</p>
