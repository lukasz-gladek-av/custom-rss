			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> is a new Metroid-like adventure from Raccoon Logic Studios, which kicks off by dropping you on some backwater planet in space, with no gear, no backup on the way, and pretty much nothing at your disposal besides your wits and what you can salvage from your ship's wreckage.</p>
<p>It's a very open-ended start to the game, and you'll see your quest list fill up faster than you can get to everything on it. But there are a few tasks that you should prioritize, and a few gameplay&nbsp; when you land in Nu Florida, to really get the best experience possible out of your time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<h2>Best Tips For Starting Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<h3>ABS - Always Be Scanning/Surveying</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the whole opening premise of Revenge of the Savage Planet is that you're dropped on this planet with nothing, there are plenty of resources in the wreckage from your ship, the tech that Alta Interglobal has left behind, and just the natural resources from the planets you visit, that you can use to make your journey easier. Scanning everything you can is also part of your character's progression, so whenever you enter a new area, it's worth jumping into the scanner mode to see if anything is highlighted orange, which means it hasn't yet been scanned.</p>
<p>The second part of this is to always be surveying the area. If you're playing on a controller, then you're going to be constantly clicking R3. This helps you keep the direction you're heading in top of mind, because it's very easy to lose track of your goal otherwise.</p>
<h3>Get Your Upgrades Sorted</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are plenty of upgrades you can shoot for at the top of the game, and you'll hit all the key ones by going through the main questlines, like adding a grapple to your whip. But there are a few you also need to prioritize from the start. No fall damage is a huge one, for example, that you should clear as soon as you can. Same goes for getting a double-jump, though that is unfortunately more involved than it should be, since you need to complete multiple environmental tasks to get to the point where you can unlock the double-jump upgrade. Upgrading your mask to filter out toxic gas is another that you'll want to get as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Basically, if it's to do with exploration and movement, you should focus on doing it as soon as you can. It's worth your time to jump to the next planet and progress the story to hit some of these key upgrades that can make the time you spend just exploring each planet you go to a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>Isolate Before You Capture</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>In the same way you'll want to scan everything, you'll want to capture all the fauna you encounter in Revenge of the Savage Planet. In some cases, doing so is pretty straightforward. Some of them don't require you to stun them first, you can sneak up and grab them with your whip. Most, however, will require that you engage them in combat and hit a weak spot a few times before you can whip them and pull them into what looks like a wormhole, transporting them back to your home base. Any damage you take while pulling them into the wormhole will stop you from being able to pull them in, and you'll have to redo the whole capture process.</p>
<p>There are often multiples of the kinds of creatures you'll be looking to capture all hanging out together, and trying to capture one of them in a scenario where the rest will surely catch on to what you're doing is a recipe for disaster. Until you've eaten enough of the orange goo you'll find on each planet, and even after you've upgraded your health and stamina significantly, you're very squishy. You'll die faster than you think if you aren't careful with how you approach a group of creatures, and you need to capture at least one of each to research them and unlock more upgrades for yourself.</p>
<p>So don't just try and pull one in if it's not completely safe. The animation for doing so is far slower than I would have liked it to be, and while Raccoon Logic could make it a tad faster, that feels unlikely. Best to be prepared and plan your capture strategy when approaching a new group of creatures you haven't researched yet.</p>
<h3>Avoid combat whenever possible</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>You gain some resources from killing the local fauna on each planet, and you're often thrown into scenarios where you need to fight your way out. But when you're exploring the planets you visit, avoid combat as often as you can.</p>
<p>It'll be difficult because many creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet are hostile just from you walking by them, so you'll hear the combat music start and stop plenty of times throughout your playthrough. But trust me when I say it's a much better use of your time to try and find resources in the environment through whatever objective you have or environmental puzzles you find. Those will always give you more resources than random combat scenarios will.</p>
<h3>Your Blaster Sucks On Purpose, Use Everything Around You Instead</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>The blaster you start the game with, for the most part, sucks. But it sucks for a reason, which is that you're not meant to just pull out your blaster with every hostile creature you face. It'll help you, for sure, but you're also meant to use the environment around you. Don't just rely on your blaster to take care of everything.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not because your blaster won't be able to handle whatever you come across. It will, but it won't be as effective, or as efficient, as the environmental hazards you can use to your advantage. Especially after you've unlocked the ability to fire various kinds of goo.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are the main things you'll want to know when starting Revenge of the Savage Planet, and if you keep them in mind, you're sure to have a smooth start in the game's early hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Rockstar surprise-dropped a new trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, along with a bunch of information about the game's story and its characters, many were quick to say that it looked great, but wondered what it would actually look like outside of a trailer that players assumed wasn't actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it was actual gameplay, and it was all captured on a PlayStation 5 console. Not a PlayStation 5 Pro, a PlayStation 5. Presumably, if it was captured on a PS5 Pro, Rockstar would have made the distinction. Rockstar confirmed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">X</a> that the trailer was a mix of in-game cutscenes and gameplay, all drawn from a PS5.</p>
<p>"<em>Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5</em>," the post reads, "<em>comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes</em>."</p>
<p>It is incredible to know that everything we saw earlier this week came from a PS5, and a credit to the work Rockstar has put in to up the ante for the game players have been waiting over a decade for. Players who didn't fork over hundreds to upgrade to a PS5 Pro (like me) are rejoicing right now, knowing that we're all in for an incredible-looking journey come May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>And if you already bought a PS5 Pro, now you can salivate thinking about how it'll look this good and potentially run at a smoother, higher framerate than what's possible on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Anyone who was on the fence about buying one can now do so with full confidence that they'll be in for an absolutely stunning experience when GTA VI launches.</p>
<p>If you want to continue salivating over how good Grand Theft Auto VI looks, there are already numerous <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">videos analyzing everything about the trailer</a>, showcasing just how much Rockstar has improved the look of everything in GTA VI compared to GTA V.</p>
<p>Shortly after Rockstar posted this confirmation to quell everyone's doubts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk&amp;t=35s">Digital Foundry</a> published its analysis video about the trailer. They spotted a few bits of aliasing and how certain details don't look as good as they could, like hair effects, for example. But overall, the DF experts are just as happy as everyone else to see how amazing it looks, even with all the caveats they present and the fact that analyzing a trailer is still no replacement for the analysis they can do when they have the game in hand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 Tech Breakdown - Incredible Realism, Impressive RT, Astonishing Detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zVIy_La7nk?start=35&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They do, however, stipulate that it will likely only have a 30fps mode on launch. It's possible that PS5 Pro users get a 60fps mode, but it's more reasonable to expect a 30fps mode. Not just because of all the tech Rockstar is using to make GTA VI look this good means that a 60fps framerate just isn't possible on consoles, but because Rockstar has a history of releasing its major games with no 60fps mode at launch.</p>
<p>And on the topic of what's not possible with GTA VI, they also speculate that this game is far too big for the Nintendo Switch 2, and that it won't be able to run on handheld PCs, at least in any state that you'd want to play it in.</p>
<p>But who knows, maybe Rockstar is taking the time afforded by the delay to optimize GTA VI as much as possible, and get a Nintendo Switch 2 version, and/or a 60fps mode ready, if not for launch, for sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release.</p>
<p>Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 out of the 18 puzzles</a> were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Blocker Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the second connector</h3>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down.</p>
<p>Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk forward when entering the puzzle area and grab the connector (C1). Connect it to the red laser generator and the red node that sits just behind a fan that will launch you to a platform in the top-right corner of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the laser has activated the fan, launch yourself onto the elevated platform and grab the hexahedron. Jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron in front of the fan. Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the node behind the fan, the blue laser generator, and the blue node on the other side of the puzzle area, behind a wall.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 down on top of the hexahedron. Your laser pattern should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Step in front of the blue laser generator so that the red laser can connect to the node that will activate the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When it launches into the air, the blue lasers will connect instead of the red, activating the blue node on the far left side of the puzzle area. That node simultaneously turns off the shield blocking the second connector (C2) and turns on a fan that will push it out onto the ground, letting you pick it up.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fair warning, the hexahedron won't fly for very long with C1 on top of it, so you might have to try this twice, as it's possible for the C2 to get stuck before making it onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Solve the puzzle</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Gather C1, C2 and the hexahedron together.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node behind the fan and the red node on the opposite side of the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and use the fan to launch yourself, with C2 in hand, to the elevated platform. Connect C2 to the blue laser generator and the blue node to fully deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground, walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>
