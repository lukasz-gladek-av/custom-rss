			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that's now available for download for free introduces a highly requested feature that is only available in a limited capacity in the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Dresscode mod developed by YIIS, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1062?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a system that lets users change character outfits and weapons in-game dynamically. The tool not only supports all the base game outfits, requiring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1071">another mod</a> to unlock those not normally available via the changing booth, but also modded outfits, of which quite a few are available online. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>

<p>Though the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth modding scene is not as big as that of other titles, plenty of great mods have been developed since the game's PC launch early this year. While the first few mods were, unsurprisingly, on the simple side, the unofficial additions made to the second entry in the remake trilogy have gradually become better and better, and have gone as far as adding completely new <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters</a>, such as the Turks Rude and Reno.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games released this generation by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 VS GTA 5 GRAPHICS AND DETAILS COMPARISON" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ih0mVAGQfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em><br>
<em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration.</em><br>
<em>Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em><br>
<em>- Account suspension</em><br>
<em>- In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em><br>
<em>- No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em><br>
<em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>
<p>This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a>, which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>
<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>
<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>
<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>
<li>Required to comply with COPPA, including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</em></p>
<p>The popular free-to-play action RPG <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being updated today to patch 5.6</a>. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.</p>
