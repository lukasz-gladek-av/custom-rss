			<p>The long-rumored PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will reportedly not be announced this year, according to a well-known, reliable insider.</p>



<p>Replying to a question on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">X</a>, reliable insider NatetheHate, who correctly revealed many video game news in the past months ahead of official announcements, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">the official reveal date for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, suggested the port's announcement will be made in 2026, unless plans change.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 release of Starfield has been rumored for a long time and reportedly in the works since the game's release in 2023. Earlier this year, we learned that the role-playing game developed by Bethesda would <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/">release later than originally planned</a> on Sony's current-generation consoles, and that its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">release should coincide with the launch of the second expansion</a>, which could shake up the game considerably with the introduction of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/">space gameplay changes and new gameplay systems. </a>Considering the reliability of the sources of these reports, there's little doubt, at this point, that PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a while before they can embark on a new journey through space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners waiting until 2026 to enjoy Starfield may not be bad, with the new content and gameplay mechanics on the horizon. So far, free updates and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a> haven't improved the game's core issues, so its late debut would allow new users to experience Starfield in a much better state.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games unveiled EVE Online: Catalyst, the next expansion coming to the 22-year-old sci-fi MMO. Catalyst goes live on November 18, and the developers believe it will kickstart a new resource rush due to mining becoming even more important than it already was. </p>



<p>Lore-wise, this is explained by a failed experiment on the enigmatic Drifter Gates, which has caused spacetime to become unstable, resulting in Hyperspace Fractures appearing across New Eden. These short-lived anomalies reveal Phased Asteroids rich in Prismaticite, a volatile new resource that reprocesses into random minerals in unpredictable quantities. Outer Ring Excavations engineers have created Phase Anchor technology: a deployable system that stabilises fractured asteroids for coordinated mining.</p>



<p>Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director, stated:</p>



<p><em>Mining is the foundation of all activity in EVE, and with Catalyst, it becomes the forefront of power. We’re reenergizing the mining experience, making it far more dynamic, social, and rewarding. To master the universe, you must master its materials. Whether you build or destroy, it all begins with ore.</em></p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, EVE Online's Executive Producer, added:</p>



<p><em>At face value, ore may seem unremarkable, yet it is the hidden catalyst of EVE’s biggest dramas. Creation, conflict, destruction, and rebirth – it’s the center of the eternal cycle of New Eden. But where valuable resources appear, so do rival capsuleers, turning mining operations into contested battlegrounds. Players will once again field the mightiest mining ships in pursuit of extraordinary resources, as well as the brand new Pioneer and Odysseus when Catalyst launches on November 18.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>EVE Online players will explore these volatile, time-limited rifts to find Phased Asteroids. Once they extracted Prismaticite, they can test their luck with random reprocessing or choose a different base mineral for the Prismaticite to be reprocessed into. This gives players increased agency in fuelling the mining industry and impacting the player-driven economy of EVE Online. There are also two new ships, the ‘Pioneer’ Mining Destroyer and the 'Odysseus' Exploration Command Ship. The former can be piloted by Alpha clones and upgraded by Omegas, while the latter is a long-range vessel built to allow veteran explorers to launch extended missions into uncharted regions of space.</p>



<p>With Catalyst, mining cycles have been revamped to be faster and more immersive, featuring a refreshed scanning overlay and a 2D ore availability map. The easy-to-read, tactical 2D map provides players with improved system visualisation, clear jump ranges and dual data overlays, offering precise navigation and sharper insights for exploration. Both 2D and 3D maps feature ore availability indicators and enhanced data readability, with customisable scales for greater clarity in every view. </p>



<p>Overall, resource extraction is now more unpredictable, engaging, and rewarding. Additionally, CCP Games introduced PLEX transaction logs to improve the in-game economy's transparency, and also tweaked the balance and visuals of Empire carriers.</p>

<p>Last month, EVE Online <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-operation-nemesis-linked-eve-online-ccp-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became linked to EVE Vanguard through Operation Nemesis</a>, allowing players of both games to influence the same universe, a long-time goal of the studio.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-developer-doesn%E2%80%99t-close-the-door-to-dlc.1330099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Ghost of Yōtei is out, Sucker Punch's Jason Connell, who co-directed the game alongside Nate Fox, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Game Informer</a> to discuss the game and characters at length. Eventually, the interviewer also inquired about the possibility of the game getting a DLC, and Connell did not close the door to the idea:</p>



<p><em>I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what's resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu. And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these. [...] You get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn't or what are the holes. And I think that's the mode that you want to be in. And that's sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it's a great character. And just like with Jin, if there's rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we'll certainly take a hard look at that for sure.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima received a DLC called Iki Island, which was released about a year after the base game and was also part of the Director's Cut launch on PS5. In this DLC, protagonist Jin Sakai departs to the titular island to stop a Mongol tribe led by a shaman named Ankhsar Khatun. The expansion is similar in size to Act One of the main game, and players can access it once they have reached Act Two of the main story. Besides the new story, Iki Island also introduced new combat skills, such as the ability to charge at enemies on horseback and new side quests and open-world activities, like visiting animal sanctuaries, where Jin can pet various animals.</p>



<p>If Ghost of Yōtei receives a DLC, it will likely be similar, at least in scope. Of course, much will depend on the reception of the base game, but that's already going pretty well. Sony hasn't shared sales data yet, but we know from Alinea Analytics that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is selling almost as quickly as its predecessor</a>, which had the advantage of a much larger install base (not to mention being released during COVID-19's lockdowns).</p>

We have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an exclusive interview with Feodor Shin</a>, the actor who played the main villain, Lord Saito.</p>
