			<p>Take-Two reported outstanding results for its first fiscal quarter of 2026, delivering total net bookings of $1.42 billion, up 17% compared to the $1.22 billion registered during last year’s fiscal first quarter. Net bookings from recurrent consumer spending (virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases and in-game advertising) also grew 17%, accounting for 83% of total net bookings. The most significant contributors to the record net bookings were NBA 2K25, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, Color Block Jam, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words With Friends, and Toy Blast.</p>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was understandably bullish, especially since the publisher has arguably its strongest games lineup on the horizon. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> ahead of the financial report, the executive listed a series of games coming next year, and in doing so also included Ken Levine's next game, Judas.</p>



<p><em>We have a number of releases coming in the next 12 months – it's probably our most robust release schedule ever. Obviously, Mafia: The Old Country is available on Steam and console. We have NBA 2K26 coming, Borderlands 4, which I'm really excited about, and WWE 2K mobile for Netflix. We've got WWE 2K26, then of course, GTA 6.</em></p>



<p><em>We have CSR 3 coming from Zynga, Judas coming from Ghost Story Games, and Project Ethos coming from 2K. It's the most robust lineup I've ever been able to talk about this far in advance.</em></p>



<p>The concept behind Judas, the so-called narrative LEGOs, has been in the works for over a decade. Levine famously hosted a GDC presentation about it in 2014 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed it again in late 2015</a>. The game itself was <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> about fifteen months later. Just last month, Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-creator-glad-allowed-design-judas-no-live-service/">thanked Take-Two</a> for not forcing Ghost Story Games to add live service elements.</p>



<p>That Judas is coming in the next twelve months is great news for the publisher, especially since the actual BioShock successor is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development trouble</a> and may not materialize for quite a while yet.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GI.biz interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed his strong confidence that Mafia: The Old Country would be successful:</p>



<p><em>I feel great about it. It's a wonderful premium title, it's priced right and it's really beautiful.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-physint-is-still-in-the-conceptual-phase.1265514/</guid>

			<p>Physint, Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">return</a> to the stealth action genre, is not going to be shown anytime soon, as work on the game is still in a very early phase.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/">IndieWire</a> in a fresh interview, the legendary game director was asked about what he is working on following the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, confirming that work is proceeding on the mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">OD project</a>, and on Physint, although Kojima-san is working by himself on the latter as it's still in the conceptual phase. While this doesn't come as a surprise, considering it was made abundantly clear back in May that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/">five or six years away</a> by Kojima-san himself, it's still a little disappointing to hear that even a first look at the game is really far away.</p>



<p>With Physint still in the conceptual phase, the mysterious OD project will undoubtedly be Hideo Kojima's next project to see the light of day. Following its announcement, very little has been said about the project in development with Microsoft, making some fear that it was cancelled alongside many other projects, including high-profile games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">MMO from the developers of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. Thankfully, the project seems to be safe, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">work is continuing.</a></p>



<p>Though not a stealth action game in the capacity Physint will likely be, Hideo Kojima's latest game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, does have <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a few mechanics</a> that bring the Metal Gear Solid series to mind, including some significant improvements for stealth and combat mechanics. You can learn more about the game now out on PlayStation 5 by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-1-hour-new-gameplay-team-ninja-explains-partnership/</link>

			<p>A new media blast for Ninja Gaiden 4 went out yesterday, and YouTuber GamersPrey has uploaded a full hour of new gameplay with absolutely no commentary attached. It's a feast for the eyes of all those fans who feared the franchise was dead. They had every right to believe so, given that the previous entry, Ninja Gaiden 3, launched in 2012 and received middling reviews to boot.</p>



<p>Now, the action series is coming back, and it is doing so with a sort of 'dream collaboration' between historic developer Team Ninja and fellow Japanese developer PlatinumGames, who is also known for acclaimed action titles like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and the Bayonetta franchise. </p>



<p>Speaking about this partnership in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryp7yKdq5Bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Iron Lords Podcast</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama from Team Ninja explained:</p>



<p><em>Well, for Team Ninja, Ninja Gaiden is a very important IP and title, so we have always wanted to create a new Ninja Gaiden game. Initially, the presidents of our company, Mr. Ono from Team Ninja, and Mr. Inaba from PlatinumGames, who are actually of the same generation and have had ongoing exchanges, discussed whether the two companies could collaborate on something new. Given PlatinumGames’ excellent track record with action games like Nier and Bayonetta, which we respect greatly, we thought it would be a great challenge to work together on a new Ninja Gaiden title. Furthermore, as you mentioned, with support from Phil Spencer at Xbox, the project was able to come together with a three-way collaboration</em>.</p>
