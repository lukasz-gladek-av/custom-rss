			<p>South of Midnight will make its inevitable arrival on PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026, developer Compulsion Games announced tonight ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>. It's the latest previously Xbox Series X/S console exclusive title to arrive on other platforms, and in this case, it seems like Compulsion Games could be aiming to get it out on other platforms right on the anniversary.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the studio's Bluesky account, with a short statement and graphic confirming the news, though interestingly, only the graphic included a mention of the PS5 version.</p>







<p>South of Midnight arrived earlier this year on April 8, 2025, and if Compulsion is aiming for sometime in Spring next year, it could just be aiming for April 8, 2026, or that same week, since April 8, 2026, is a Wednesday, and games are more commonly released either at the beginning or the end of a week.</p>



<p>I reviewed South of Midnight for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">Wccftech when it arrived earlier this year, and gave it a 7/10, writing</a>, "<em>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</em>"</p>
