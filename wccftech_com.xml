			<p>Speculation <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already running rampant</a> on which games will be featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomorrow's <strong>State of Play</strong></a>, and one of the most anticipated PlayStation games of the year is certainly <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>. However, the studio has just dropped a tidbit hinting that <strong>it might not be featured at the event</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2021332733998612529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replying on X</a> to a user who asked when they'd release more information, <strong>the developers said it's happening at some point this Spring</strong>. Obviously, we are not in Spring yet.</p>



<p>It's possible they might still show off a brief new trailer without any further details about the game, but <strong>the more likely outcome is that they'll just save everything for a later showing</strong>. Perhaps they could even get their dedicated broadcast in April or May; after all, the <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> franchise has done wonders for Sony, so Marvel's Wolverine could get a special spotlight.</p>



<p>It also makes sense from a schedule perspective. Marvel's Wolverine <strong>isn't due until sometime in the Fall</strong> season, whereas another game from a Sony-owned studio is coming out much sooner. I'm referring to <strong>Housemarque's Saros</strong>, which will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 30</strong>; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned for March 20</a>, but the Finnish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a <strong>slight delay</strong></a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Saros could get a deep dive at the State of Play, but it might not be the only PlayStation Studios update featured there. Insider Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/post-151107211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he wouldn't be surprised if Sony Santa Monica was ready to reveal the long-awaited game led by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>. As a reminder, following the massively successful 2018 <strong>God of War reboot</strong>, Barlog transitioned into the role of Creative Director and Producer for <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was directed by <strong>Eric Williams</strong></a>. We don't know a lot about this new project, except that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, <strong>it was going well as of July 2025</strong>, and it's not technically a new IP but might feel like one.</p>

			<p>Following a recent <strong>Marathon</strong> hands-on event organized by <strong>Bungie</strong> for Chinese media, new gameplay footage and impressions are now available online. The event reportedly <strong>took place in Shanghai earlier this month</strong> and was the first held outside North America.</p>



<p>The most impressive aspect reported by attendees was the <strong>significant expansion of worldbuilding and narrative depth</strong>. The tutorial and faction introductions now provide clear origins and motivations for the playable characters, creating a more coherent story framework for the extraction shooter game. Players can discover Dr. Strauss's will; he's a pivotal figure who connects multiple narrative threads from the original Marathon trilogy.</p>



<p>The PvE experience of this Marathon build <strong>proved quite challenging</strong>, according to multiple impressions. AI enemies continuously call in reinforcements over time, and environmental hazards are aplenty, including poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines scattered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>Resource management adds an extra layer of difficulty, as <strong>medical supplies and shields are fairly expensive at vendors</strong>. By the end of the play sessions, some testers couldn't afford these items without selling all their buffs. <strong>The high-risk environment apparently discourages early combat or PvP engagements</strong>, which typically result in net losses, pushing players to focus on missions to upgrade base stats instead. At least one map confirmed support for 18 players (6 teams of 3), though there are also smaller maps that support 12 players (4 teams of 3). </p>



<p>Since the Alpha version, <strong>Marathon has received a significant visual upgrade</strong>. Environments now convey a darker, more mysterious atmosphere reminiscent of Bungie's <strong>Pathways into Darkness</strong> (1993) and the original Marathon trilogy. <strong>The UI has also undergone a major overhaul</strong>, though some aspects still feel somewhat awkward according to the event's attendees. Perhaps that's just a matter of getting used to them. </p>



<p><strong>Skill distribution across all classes appears to be well-balanced</strong>, allowing flexible team compositions. Several Shells feature movement abilities, enhancing mobility options. Each runner has six base appearances tied to their respective faction.</p>



<p><strong>The weapon arsenal includes 28 guns, each with two or more skins</strong>. Some even change the entire weapon model. Every weapon features one charm slot and three sticker slots that unlock through challenge completion. Overall, <strong>impressions of the gunplay are very good</strong>, but then again, that's an area where Bungie always excelled. The cosmetic shop and battle pass were, unfortunately, unavailable during the event.</p>



<p>The footage is <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LrFZz6EGC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 10-minute video</a> available on the Chinese video sharing website Bilibili featuring <strong>Lockdown</strong>, a large scale PvE event that can trigger on the <strong>Abyssal Swamp</strong> map. Around 15 minutes later, a Point of Interest (POI) may be locked down and surrounded by red bubbles. To trigger this event, players can use the 'HEC' consumable. This allows them to enter the red bubble without taking damage for 45 seconds, during which time they can press a switch to close it. </p>



<p>After activating the switch, <strong>three waves of enemies will appear, with the final one featuring a boss</strong>. Defeating the boss provides the first wave of loot and a keycard. The locked-down area will then move to another area (it could be 'Algae Pool', 'Isolation Zone', or 'Comprehensive Facility'), and this process will repeat up to 3 times. Each time, Marathon players will need to use a keycard from the previous level to increase the difficulty level.</p>



<p>Bungie Game Director Joe Ziegler was also <a href="https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Ali123</a>. In the conversation, <strong>he shared the studio's vision for Marathon seasons</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Each season in Marathon will be a fresh start. We envision each season as a months-long "roguelike adventure ." Each season, players will start with limited resources and must gradually grow stronger through various means, forging their own unique path to growth. To implement this concept, each season will incorporate new content and systems, substantially reshaping the seasonal gameplay. That said, some content will be retained at the player account level. For example, cosmetic items acquired through unlocking or purchasing will continue to be retained across seasons.</em></p>



<p>After several delays, Marathon <strong>will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 5</a></strong>. In less than a month, we'll know if Bungie turned around the mild reception of the previous testing phases.</p>

			<p><strong>Grasshopper Manufacture's ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN</strong> released yesterday to fairly positive critical reviews. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review-great-scott-what-a-ride/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review (8.7/10)</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em><strong>It is the most mechanically polished and stable game</strong>&nbsp;since the original Shadows of the Damned, yet it beats with the heart of&nbsp;Flower, Sun, and Rain. It leaves behind&nbsp;<strong>the technical jank and the empty-world frustrations</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;No More Heroes III&nbsp;without losing the "punk" soul that makes a Suda51 game&nbsp;<strong>essential</strong>. It is a game that&nbsp;<strong>respects your time</strong>&nbsp;with its 12-hour runtime, but still&nbsp;<strong>leaves its mark</strong>&nbsp;with its fever-dream narrative.</em></p>



<p>The debut on Steam seems very solid, too, with a 'Very Positive' verdict from user reviews, thanks to 93% of the reviews giving ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN a thumbs up.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_PObigha-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a "Launch Day Special" Grasshopper Direct</a>, Goichi Suda himself provided an update on several things. The studio was hoping to get the ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN artbook and soundtrack out by now, but there has been a delay. Still, <strong>they're coming "as soon as possible"</strong>. Grasshopper is also <strong>trying to make a retail version of the game a reality</strong>; they are currently in talks with several publishers to achieve that goal, which many players requested. The same goes for the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The biggest surprise, though, was that Grasshopper Manufacture <strong>actually has an unannounced game due in 2026</strong>:</p>



<p><em>We actually have a surprise announcement for you all in this Grasshopper Direct… It’s ALMOST 100% certain that we’ll be releasing one more game during 2026! What kind of game? When can we announce it? We’re not sure just yet… But if you wait a little longer, I feel like we’ll be able to make an announcement soon. Keep checking out various events, media, and videos like this, and sooner or later, we’ll have that big announcement ready for you all. Please keep an eye out and look forward to it.</em></p>
