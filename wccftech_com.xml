			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will feature multiple display modes on consoles, as well as a 120 Hz output option, judging from the PS Plus exclusive beta that is now live worldwide.</p>
<p>As shown in a screenshot shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130805709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, the next entry in the series, launching in a few months, will allow players to either prioritize resolution or framerate, as well as enable 120 Hz output for VRR-compatible displays. Unfortunately, according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130807878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, both display modes have to make some heavy compromises in terms of framerate and image quality, and performance is not very stable in either mode, dropping heavily in some areas so much that VRR is disengaged, but thankfully, there's still some time before release, and things could be improved further in time for release.</p>
<p>While image quality and performance may not be amazing, it definitely feels like Monster Hunter Wilds will be a massive step forward over its predecessors thanks to some of its new features, which include the Focus Mode gameplay mechanics and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/">100 player lobbies</a> that promise improved interactivity with other hunters.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2024. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview.</a></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> patch introduces an image treatment solution that delivers better image quality from what we have seen so far of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> discussed this new image treatment solution, saying that it delivers a pristine image quality that is close to what NVIDIA DLSS can deliver on PC and considerably better than what we have seen PSSR do so far. This solution, which is reportedly in development for Guerrilla Games' next project, is likely a compute-based solution that doesn't use the machine learning hardware of the PlayStation 5 Pro, so it could potentially run on the base console, where it could deliver much more impressive results, considering the only upscaler available on the regular PS5 is AMD FSR, which delivers some middling results, as we have seen over and over in the past few months.</p>
<p>Although the great image quality delivered by this image treatment solution could be thanks to the high base resolution (1440p / 1584p to 4K), it could also be another great option for developers, as it could allow Guerrilla or any other developer using the Decima engine, like Kojima Productions with Death Stranding 2, to use the PlayStation 5 Pro machine learning hardware to do other things.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #186: Teraflop War OVER, Killzone Dead, Alan Wake 2 PS5 Pro, Silent Hill 2 Patched!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RrGDYXvKBk?start=6024&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The superior image quality delivered by Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 5 Pro, thanks to this new image treatment solution, could be matched by any other game using PSSR with a high enough base resolution, as the games using the upscaler seen so far had a much lower base resolution than 1440p. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to see for ourselves what the AI-powered upscaler will be able to do under the right conditions, as the console launches next week, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

			<p>We're now less than a month away from the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a>, which in itself seems impossible to process. The game has had so many delays (some forced on the developers by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, for example) that even the most attached fans were skeptical at some point.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is almost here, though. GSC Game World recently hosted a final press event in Prague where they shared a few extra details about their game. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1msvzkT1d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by Radio Times Gaming, for example, Technical Producer Yevhenii Kulyk talked about optimization after the interviewer mentioned the many recent Unreal Engine games suffering from stuttering issues on PC.</p>
<p><em>To meet our expectations for optimization on Xbox and PCs, we made a lot of changes to render threads, some CPU optimizations, and a lot of RAM optimizations. Now we are pretty much close to finishing the whole polishing process. Our aim is to provide a game that is running constantly in stable FPS and with stable performance all the time.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the Unreal Engine 5 version they've been using, Kulyk said:</p>
<p><em>Our engine is based on Unreal Engine 5.1, but we internally call it 5.1.GSC because to make a world this big, we had to adopt and, let's say, maybe rewrite and upgrade some tools that were provided by the basic Unreal Engine to fit our needs to create the world of STALKER 2.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-says-ue5s-nanite-and-lumen-were-the-right-bricks-to-properly-finish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the news of upgrading from UE4 to UE5, stating that Lumen and Nanite were the 'right bricks' to finish the game. However, Epic introduced several performance and quality improvements to both technologies in the more recent UE5 versions; let's hope staying on an older, albeit custom, build won't jeopardize the performance. After all, the team seems confident in their promise of a smooth frame rate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kulyk reiterated what we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in our exclusive Gamescom interview: mods are coming, to both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><em>We are aware that our player base, especially the old fans, is waiting for our game to support mods. We will bring in the mods to consoles, so they will be available on the Xbox as well as the PC We are preparing a very big toolkit that will provide the mod makers with all the necessary tools to create mods, from the smallest one to big total conversions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out on November 20 on PC and Xbox Series S|X, available from day one on Game Pass. A PlayStation 5 release hasn't been publicly talked about yet, but we know from a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a three-month exclusivity window in place, so the game could launch on Sony's console in early 2025.</p>
