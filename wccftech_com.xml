			<p>Today, the developer behind Corepunk, Artificial Core, <a href="https://wccftech.com/corepunk-is-an-upcoming-top-down-mmorpg-featuring-pve-pvp-and-fog-of-war/">has announced that Corepunk</a> will be going into Early Access on November 26. This game is shaping up to be an open-world MMORPG crossed over with a MOBA, with a top-down isometric viewpoint to the game. If you think this is something that will interest you, there is a trailer on YouTube that is just under two minutes long to showcase what you can expect from Corepunk. You can watch this video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corepunk: Official Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0L8Aj0u9CM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Corepunk comes with a lot of unique features, including expansive character customization, fog-of-war mechanics, and the ability to experience both PvE and PvP in a player-driven world. There are a variety of class options with in-depth skill trees that allow you to stand out from the crowd while you explore the cyber-fantasy world and engage with the storylines set out in front of you.</p>
<p>For those who are curious about the Early Access period of Corepunk, it will feature three full-voiced story episodes, which include a crafting and gathering system. You'll have six character classes to choose from and 15 world bosses to go up against. Of course, this is just the start of the game, and there will be plenty more added in the future. For those who pre-order the game, it will give access <a href="https://corepunk.com/en-us?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=b8576b44ac-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_11_18_06_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-b8576b44ac-256552253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game launcher</a> and Early Access build.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Corepunk is in active development, with the Early Access period symbolizing the final stage of alpha testing, which is where the developers will be focused on making sure the game is optimized with bug fixing and polishes while also continuing to build on the content that is already released. Corepunk is set for a full launch by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>During the Early Access period of Corepunk, you'll get to explore three biomes, which will take you through the forest, swamps, and steppes, which all have their own unique challenges to face. In total, there are 350 quests that you can participate in during the Early Access period. A lot of these are side quests and are totally optional, allowing you to tweak the playstyle to your liking. As the Early Access period progresses, the developers plan on adding the Extraction Prison Island, PvE instances, and more heroes for players to choose from, allowing for a further unique experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Capital Markets Day dedicated to investors, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment has revealed new information on Control 2 and Alan Wake 2. As for the latter, we learned that it has sold 1.8 million units to date, which, however, isn't enough to fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoup</a> all the development and marketing costs yet.</p>
<p>Control 2 is aiming far higher, with Remedy telling investors that sales of 3-4 million units would be required to fully recuperate a budget of €50 million (up from the €30 million spent on the first one) and go into profits. Part of the reason is that the sequel is being turned into an action RPG, whereas the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> an action adventure. Action RPG is a more marketable genre with a bigger audience. The first Control has sold 4.5 million units to date, while 19 million players have accessed the game in total (including, for example, Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscriptions).</p>
<p>Control 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Back then, it looked like Remedy would repeat the successful partnership with 505 Games that gave birth to the previous installment. However, they completely <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> the plan earlier this year by acquiring the IP from 505 Games for €17 million. Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Remedy had chosen a new partner, Annapurna Interactive; they would co-finance the game's development while leaving the IP in the hands of the Finnish studio and also work on live action adaptations for both Control and Alan Wake.</p>
<p>Before Control 2, Remedy will launch its cooperative multiplayer spin-off FBC <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, which is being made on a €30 million budget, won't cost full price, and will require three million units sold to be successful.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in addition to the multiple projects related to the so-called Remedy Connected Universe, the studio is also remaking its first two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, for Rockstar Games. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, the remake project entered full production three months ago.</p>

			<p>A game that has been out since 2015 and has been released on many different platforms is only now seeing a cross-play option implemented next month. If you've been eagerly awaiting the day for Rainbow Six Siege to get PC and Console cross-play, you won't have to wait much longer. Support for cross-play on all platforms will launch in December with the latest update to be added, Rainbow Six Siege's Year 9 Season 4 update named Operation Collision Point. With this update, it means that players can now team up with their friends regardless of what platform they're playing on. However, if there is a PC player in the group, the team will always be put into the PC matchmaking pool.</p>
<p>While this is the first time Rainbow Six Siege is getting cross-play on all platforms, it isn't the first time the game had any sort of cross-play, as there was cross-play and cross-progression enabled for PC, Amazon Luna, and the Google Stadia version of the game in June 2021. However, Google Stadia fizzled out very quickly, and this brings us to the current day, where only PC and Amazon Luna had cross-play, or Xbox and PlayStation, which was added in late 2022.</p>
<p>While it has taken a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">relatively long time</a>, this is something they've been actively working towards throughout the years that Rainbow Six Siege has been live. When cross-play for Xbox and PlayStation was released in late 2022, Ubisoft also added cross-progression across all platforms. Adding cross-play between PC and console is the final hurdle, so to speak. It has taken a relatively long time for them to get to this point, but it's because they've also been working to ensure that players are protected and cheaters are accurately punished if detected.</p>
<p>"Player Protection advances this season include Mousetrap Penalty adjustments to account for crossplay, automatic match cancellation if a cheater is detected, an overhaul for the Reputation center, and AI text moderation," says Chris Watters at Ubisoft. All of the information regarding<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4luBBDMfipI6BDrwGGMV0L/rainbow-six-siege-operation-collision-point-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Operation Collision Point</a> is available to read on the Ubisoft news page, which breaks down how they have balanced some of the Operators, as well as general improvements that are suited to the cross-platform experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news of the upcoming update, Ubisoft has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoHI1dehzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-minute video</a> that provides information on how to utilize Blackbeard, as well as some starter tips for those who may be getting stuck into the game for the first time.</p>
