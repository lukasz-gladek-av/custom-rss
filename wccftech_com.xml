			<p>Today's AWS Outage <a href="https://wccftech.com/aws-outage-snaps-chatgpt-fortnite-down/">took down about half of the internet</a>, with apps and services across industries suffering issues throughout the day. Thankfully, we're starting to see the service slowly crawl back to life, which means that major gaming services that were taken down, like Fortnite, Roblox, and PSN are starting to recover.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Epic Games is reporting "<em>All Systems Operational</em>" <a href="https://status.epicgames.com/">on its service status website</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">Epic Games Store</a>, Fortnite, Rocket League, and Unreal Engine. Roblox is still reporting the issue as an "<em>Active Incident</em>" at the top of <a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/history/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d">its service status page</a>, though the last update on the timeline of the issue does state that AWS has informed Roblox it is back online and operational.</p>



<p>Regarding the PlayStation Network (PSN), PlayStation is <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">also reporting that all of its services are up and running</a>, and EA is also reporting its services across all of its games, including Battlefield 6, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/">are back online</a>, after players were reporting issues seemingly caused by the AWS outage.</p>



<p>The actual <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS Service page</a> is currently only reporting "<em>Impacted</em>" service in North Virginia, with other regions all listed as being operational. That said, if you do continue to encounter connection issues when trying to matchmaker in a game or even just connect to the PlayStation Store, and you've already ruled out your own internet as being the issue, then there might still be some lingering issues.</p>



<p>Hopefully, any outages will be cleared up soon, and these signs of recovery are already an indication that anyone looking to get some gaming time in today shouldn't have a problem, even if you're planning to play online.</p>

			<p>The Epic Games Store's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-buyers-guide-2025">Halloween Sale has officially started</a>, with a large selection of games currently on sale for up to 80% off on games like Alan Wake 2, Silent Hill 2 Remake, Metro Exodus, and more. The sale began today, on October 20, and will continue through the rest of the month and into November, ending on November 3rd.</p>



<p>Some other major titles on sale include Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced at 50% off, Red Dead Redemption 2 at 75% off, Cyberpunk 2077 at 65% off, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt at 80% off. Both Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and the first Dying Light, specifically the 'Essentials Edition' of the first game which includes a slew of DLC updates are on sale for 67% and 80% off, respectively.</p>



<p>With regards to games that released in 2025, Titan Quest II is on sale for 10% off, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is on sale for 30% off. Killing Floor 3 is also on sale for 20% off, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is on sale for 40% off, which is seemingly the biggest discount for a 2025 release across the whole sale. While it's not the biggest discount, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is regarded as one of the best games of 2025, is also on sale for 10% off.</p>



<p>Not technically part of the sale, but also worth mentioning, is that Amnesia: The Bunker and Samorost 3 are currently available on the Epic Games Store for free until October 23rd at 11am ET. After that, Fear the Spotlight will be free from October 23rd to October 30th.</p>



<p>It's all together a solid sale that gives you a good chance to grab a few horror-focused titles on a discount, and add the latest entry into a beloved horror series to your library for free.</p>
