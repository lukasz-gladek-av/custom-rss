            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In October 2024, a job listing <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-montreal-rumored-to-be-working-on-new-dc-comics-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that WB Games Montréal was recruiting for a new game based on a DC Comics license. That was fairly unsurprising in itself, considering that the developer has only ever worked on such games, from 2013's Batman: Arkham Origins to 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gotham Knights</a>. Now, though, <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another job listing</a> suggests that this project is being designed as a live service, which was enough to ruffle the feathers of many fans. </p>



<p>The job listing is for an Executive Producer who would oversee many aspects of the game's development, including the planned live service operations, as stated in the excerpt below.</p>



<p><em>As an Executive Producer, you will lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog. You will oversee the entire production lifecycle—from concept to launch and beyond—ensuring the game meets the highest standards of quality, innovation, and player engagement. You will work closely with the Creative Director and studio leadership to align creative vision with production realities, manage cross-functional teams, and ensure the project delivers on time, on budget, and to critical and commercial success.</em></p>



<p><strong><u><em>Production Oversight:</em></u></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure robust QA and live operations processes are in place to support a high-quality player experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Execution and Market Readiness:</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee post-launch content and live service strategy, ensuring ongoing player engagement.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Anyone who followed Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will understand why many fans are already quite disappointed by the prospect. Created specifically as a live service game based on the popular team of DC Comics antiheroes, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed so spectacularly that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused</a> a $200 million lower EBITDA and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">41% year-to-year decrease in revenue</a> for Warner Bros. Games compared to the previous highly successful launch of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Granted, one game's failure does not equal another. Sure, there have been several failed live service games over the last few years, but a few have also succeeded, and when they do, they rake in big money. That's why publishers keep trying, and we already have plenty of indication that WB Games (now restructured into four divisions dedicated to its tentpole franchises) has not been deterred by the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. They are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eager to make a Hogwarts Legacy live service game</a>, after all.</p>



<p>Of course, it's way too early to say which DC Comics license WB Games Montréal will use for its next project. Still, we'll keep an eye out for further listings and rumors.</p>

			<p>During a panel hosted at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, Free Range Games and North Beach Games announced Durin's Folk, an expansion to the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Not many details were revealed at this point, except for an expanded end-game story, 'exciting' new game mechanics, and many more yet-to-be-revealed secrets.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As you might recall, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in October 2023</a> for PC and PlayStation 5. Initially, it was a console exclusive for Sony's console and a PC exclusive for the Epic Games Store. That changed in August 2024, when Free Range Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-now-available-on-steam-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> on Steam and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play between all platforms.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was updated to optionally support dedicated servers. They can either be rented for a fee from a third-party provider or hosted by users. Owners of a dedicated server can then tweak specific settings to their liking, such as:</p>



<h4 id="h-difficulty-settings"><em>Difficulty Settings</em></h4>



<p><em><strong>setdifficulty</strong>&nbsp;- sets all of the server's difficulty settings to use a preset</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>setdifficulty story</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty solo</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty normal</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty hard</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty custom</em></strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>‍<strong>setcustomdifficulty [name] [value]&nbsp;</strong>- sets the specified difficulty setting [name] to the given value. Eg.&nbsp;setcustomdifficulty [combatdifficulty] [verylow]</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Names:&nbsp;</em></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>combatdifficulty&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>enemyaggression</em></li>



<li><em>survivaldifficulty</em></li>



<li><em>miningdrops</em></li>



<li><em>worlddrops</em></li>



<li><em>hordefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>siegefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>patrolfrequency</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em><strong>Values</strong>:&nbsp;</em>
<ul>
<li><em>verylow, low, default, high, veryhigh&nbsp;‍</em></li>



<li><em>Not all of the named settings have the same range of values - some don’t have&nbsp;<strong>verylow, veryhigh</strong>&nbsp;so if those value are chosen, it will be set to&nbsp;<strong>low or high</strong>&nbsp;instead.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Durin's Folk expansion is truly to launch soon, the developers may try to match the second anniversary of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which is in around three months from now, on October 24, to be exact. Anyway, we'll keep you updated on any official announcements from Free Range Games.</p>
