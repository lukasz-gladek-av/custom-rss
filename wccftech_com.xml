			<p>Razer’s expertise in delivering high-performance gaming peripherals is evident in the BlackShark V3 Pro for Xbox, <a href="https://www.razer.com/newsroom/product-news/razer-launches-blackshark-v3-pro/?srsltid=AfmBOooV7LJUHOwVyxWb28UdRB4GpiQilTb_t8U0JvNkrkufpx7c700x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> back in July of this year. Priced at $269.99, it’s a premium option compared to the less expensive BlackShark V3, designed with Xbox-specific features like green-stitched earcups and seamless integration with Xbox Series X|S. Notably, this Xbox model also supports PlayStation consoles, unlike the PlayStation version, making it the ideal choice for gamers with both platforms. After extensive testing in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon</a>, the headset delivers reliable, high-quality audio tailored for competitive and immersive gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Design</strong></p>



<p>The BlackShark V3 Pro features a sleek matte black design with subtle Xbox-green accents, maintaining a professional aesthetic without excessive RGB lighting. Its aviation-inspired yoke system, enhanced for durability compared to the V2 Pro, connects oval earcups with adjustable metal hinges for a comfortable, customized fit. Weighing 367 grams, it’s lightweight for extended use. Swappable magnetic faceplates allow for personalization, and the earcups swivel 45 degrees for convenient resting during breaks.</p>



<p>Two practical details stand out: the volume knob on the left earcup is smooth and precise, easily located without looking, enabling quick adjustments during gameplay. Similarly, the textured power button is distinctively ridged, ensuring it’s easy to find without confusion with other controls like the Game/Chat mix roller. Voice prompts for mode changes further enhance usability, creating a streamlined and intuitive design.</p>







<p><strong>Features</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro offers a robust feature set for Xbox and PlayStation gamers. Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2 provides a low 10ms latency over 2.4GHz, ensuring responsive audio for fast-paced titles like Call of Duty. Bluetooth 5.3 enables simultaneous device pairing for music or calls, with USB-C or 3.5mm wired options as a backup. A key advantage is its cross-platform compatibility: the Xbox version works on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, while the PlayStation model is limited to Sony’s ecosystem. This makes the Xbox variant the better choice for multi-console households.</p>



<p>Windows Sonic spatial audio on Xbox and Tempest 3D AudioTech on PlayStation deliver immersive 3D soundscapes, enhancing directional awareness in games like Gears 5. The Razer Audio app (mobile) and Synapse 4 (for PC cross-play) provide a 10-band EQ with nine onboard presets, including 12 pro-tuned profiles for games like Apex Legends and Valorant. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), powered by four microphones, reduces low-frequency noise like household appliances by 77%, though it falls slightly short of top-tier competitors. The detachable 12mm HyperClear Full Band boom mic, with 48kHz sampling and noise rejection, ensures clear voice communication.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro excels in delivering precise audio. In Halo Infinite, footsteps and weapon sounds are distinct, enabling quick reactions. In Forza Horizon, engine notes and environmental sounds are well-balanced, driven by TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers (12-28,000Hz response). These produce clear mids, detailed highs, and controlled bass, with minor EQ adjustments smoothing any treble sharpness. Latency is imperceptible, ensuring audio aligns perfectly with on-screen action on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>ANC effectively minimizes background noise, aiding focus, and Bluetooth multipoint switching between console and phone is seamless for communication apps. The headset adapts professional-grade audio for console gaming, offering versatility across platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Sound Quality</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro’s audio performance is a highlight, delivering clarity and depth that cater to both competitive and immersive gaming. The TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers produce a balanced soundstage, with impactful bass that gives explosions and engine roars in Forza Horizon a satisfying weight without overpowering subtler elements. Midrange frequencies are clear and well-defined, ensuring dialogue in story-driven titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> remains articulate and natural, even during chaotic action sequences. Highs are crisp, capturing delicate cues like the rustle of grass or distant gunfire in Call of Duty, which is critical for pinpointing enemy positions in competitive play.</p>



<p>The default tuning leans toward FPS precision, emphasizing directional audio for tactical advantage, but it’s versatile enough for other genres. For instance, in open-world games, the headset renders expansive environmental soundscapes with impressive detail, from the chirping of birds to the hum of distant machinery. A slight treble emphasis can occasionally feel sharp during extended sessions, but the Razer Audio app’s 10-band EQ allows fine-tuning to soften this for music or cinematic experiences. Distortion is minimal even at high volumes, ensuring long-term listening comfort. While not audiophile-grade, the V3 Pro’s audio fidelity is among the best in its class, striking a balance between competitive clarity and immersive richness.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>



<p>After extended sessions of playing various titles, the V3 Pro’s breathable cloth-wrapped memory foam earcups (66x45mm) and padded headband remain comfortable without excessive pressure. The swivel accommodates various head shapes, and the lightweight design reduces fatigue. A minor drawback: the yoke may feel slightly loose on smaller heads during rapid movement, though this rarely impacts focused gameplay.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>



<p>Razer claims a 48-hour battery life, and testing with ANC, high volume, and Bluetooth use yielded 42 hours. The hot-swappable battery allows uninterrupted play with a spare, and a full USB-C charge takes under three hours, supporting extended gaming sessions.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro for Xbox is a refined, high-performance headset. At $249.99, it’s a premium investment, but its precise audio, clear microphone, intuitive volume knob, and distinct power button deliver exceptional value. Unlike the PlayStation model, it is compatible with both Xbox and PlayStation, making it a standout for multi-platform gamers. The Xbox version is thus a strong choice for those seeking a reliable, versatile headset that elevates competitive and immersive gaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-the-no-mercy-campaign-with-rtx-remix.1319449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, the so-called Nostalgia Drive Team released the first work-in-progress build of Left 4 Dead RTX NTD. This is based on the previous work done by modder xoxor4d, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>The Nostalgia Drive Team describes Left 4 Dead RTX NTD as a visual overhaul of Valve's classic co-op first-person shooter game released in 2009, rebuilt with the NVIDIA RTX Remix platform (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-1-2-advanced-path-traced-particle-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got a major update last month</a>, allowing modders to inject old games with enhanced fire and smoke effects through a path traced particle system). This fan-made visual revamp focuses specifically on the No Mercy campaign and reimagines its environments with high-resolution physically based rendering (PBR) materials, improved reflections, and manually recreated lighting to achieve a cinematic and atmospheric look.</p>



<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full PBR material system</li>



<li>Manually re-lit scenes (RTX Remix cannot capture native lights)</li>



<li>Enhanced shadows, reflections, and surface roughness</li>



<li>Upgraded materials for buildings, interiors, and props</li>



<li>4K texture rebuilds and improved normal maps</li>



<li>Full RTX Remix runtime compatibility</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can download the WIP build of Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD, which weighs 7.15GB, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/left-4-dead-2-rtx-by-nostalgia-drive-team/downloads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-wip-build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from ModDB</a>. However, the NTD team shared the following warnings and disclaimers:</p>



<p><em>This is not a complete remaster but a foundation for future RTX mods in terms of compatibility and visuals. Due to engine limitations and ongoing development, some assets may appear unfinished or darker.</em></p>



<p><em>Expect missing/dark skyboxes, rubber-like materials on some models, incomplete lighting setups, water surfaces that may look off, and CPU-heavy performance on animated meshes. Moreover, the renderer is currently forced to run single-threaded, Alpha foliage heavily impacts performance, software skinning causes CPU bottlenecks, and some effects are still unhandled or inaccurate.</em></p>



<p>If, on the other hand, you want to contribute to the project, the Nostalgia Drive Team seeks help in the following areas: materials, lighting, assets, and testing. Those interested in joining the team can contact the user Entity in the official RTX Remix Showcase Discord channel.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-in-80-minutes.1319371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Indie Barcelona-based developer Epictellers Entertainment announced that its turn-based cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight met and exceeded the minimum funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Kickstarter</a> just eighty minutes after the campaign opened.</p>



<p>For the record, the minimum goal was €75K, but supporters have already pushed the campaign to around €280K as we speak. With 29 days left on the campaign, it's fair to imagine the developers will be able to get a far greater amount of funding when all is said and done.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is based on Paizo's eponymous science fantasy setting originally introduced in 2017. Players can look forward to a party-based RPG where they will lead a legendary crew, shape their destiny with choices and, most importantly, save the galaxy. It has been described as Divinity: Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>



<p>The premise is that the ship's captain has vanished just as the galaxy is facing annihilation. Players must then assemble a crew of misfits from across the stars. There are six unique companions, from android assassins to mystic prophets, each with personal stories and moral dilemmas. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight adapts the tabletop RPG's second edition and includes the following classes: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. Being a roleplaying game, leveling up and collecting alien gear to become more powerful will be the key.</p>



<p>Epictellers stressed that no choice is forbidden, yet everything has consequences. Factions will remember the crew's deeds, and the companions will judge the player's heart. Branching storylines ensure that no two adventures are alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the 40-60 hours of adventure, players will get to explore neon stations, undead worlds, digital gods, and cosmic dragons. The game features multiple difficulty settings (from a story mode to Nightmare), mod support, and community tools on PC, and a voice cast directed by Neil Newbon (who won multiple awards for his performance as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3).</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is currently targeting a Q2 2026 launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. At that point, the game will feature Act 1 with around 10-15 hours of gameplay. The full release is loosely estimated to happen in 2027.</p>
