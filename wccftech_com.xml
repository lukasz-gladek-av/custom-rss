			<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher and have patience, because The Witcher 4 will not be appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025</a> next month. The highly anticipated RPG from CD Projekt RED will be skipping this year's awards and will presumably only show up on stage during the call-outs for the Most Anticipated Game award.</p>



<p>The news comes directly from the joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski, who posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) expressing his gratitude that The Witcher 4 was nominated for the category, while also making sure to keep players' expectations in check.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards</em>," Nowakowski wrote. "<em>Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.</em>"</p>

<p>It's perhaps disappointing news for players who can't wait to get their hands on the next installment in CD Projekt RED's popular franchise, but it can't be too surprising. If you've been following The Witcher 4's production, then you'll have heard that CDPR confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">back in March 2025 that the game will not be released until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>We all still have a whole year of waiting before we can expect to start seeing new trailers and eventually, a release date. Nowakowski even reaffirmed this during the Q&amp;A portion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">CDPR's recent third-quarter financial report</a>. When asked about The Witcher 4, Nowakowski would not comment on the game's production, saying, "<em>The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>So, with this year's show off the table for The Witcher 4, anyone waiting to return to the world of The Witcher will have to turn their attention to The Game Awards 2026, since that's a strong candidate for when we'd see a significant trailer reveal.</p>



<p>As far as what will be at The Game Awards, we're starting to see select developers confirm their attendance and that they'll be bringing a new trailer. <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525">Exodus, for example, will be at the show with a new trailer reveal</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/</link>
            <guid>1366441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Splitgate 2 launched with a pretty middling start. Players who enjoyed the first game were certainly enjoying 1047 Games' attempt at a sequel, but it wasn't the big new shooter on the block, the way the first Splitgate was in its early days. Unfortunately, an overly confident co-founder promising to "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">make FPS great again</a>,</em>" a poor show of bravado at Summer Game Fest, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">an insanely expensive $145 cosmetic bundle</a> meant that 1047 Games really took one on the chin when it put Splitgate 2 back into beta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">admitted it had been released "<em>too early</em>."</a></p>



<p>Now, five months after the fact, 1047 Games is ready to try again. The servers will be taken offline on December 4 to prepare for a proper relaunch later in the month, which technically means that it's actually relaunching sooner than 1047 Games had originally planned, since in its <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">July statement</a>, it projected a return for the game in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress</em>," the studio writes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096?l=english">on the game's Steam page.</a> "<em>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.</p><p>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December.…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 - Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1993028502925541517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When 1047 Games took Splitgate 2 back into beta, it not only 'unlaunched' the game, but took the servers offline for the original Splitgate, and laid off developers for the second time within a month, since its first layoff happened between the span of time that Splitgate 2 first launched on June 6 and when it was put back into beta on July 22.</p>



<p>It has been hosting beta tests in the months since, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">a few hundred players logging into Steam, helping 1047 Games further its testing</a>. But a few hundred players are not going to sustain a multiplayer studio in today's age. If Splitgate 2 has any hope of sticking around, you wouldn't be wrong to imagine that its relaunch needs to be the biggest event in Splitgate history. </p>



<p>Will it be able to pull that off? We'll see. One thing to note is that with the servers going offline on December 4, and its relaunch coming "<em>later in December</em>," it just might be the case that 1047 Games co-founder and game director Ian Proulx makes a return to a Geoff Keighley stage (sans headwear) and announces the relaunch <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">at The Game Awards</a>. It wouldn't be the strangest thing to happen at a Kieghley show.</p>

			<p><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is definitely not lacking in content, but if you have already played through the game once and want to experience it again, but with a twist that can make</span> the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-continues-to-show-incredible-combat-depth-over-one-year-after-its-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep combat</a>&nbsp;even more interesting, this mod, released earlier this month, is the one you are looking for.</p>



<p>Created by D3DNieR, the Playable Rufus Shinra mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1598?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a playable version of the boss character, complete with all of his iconic techniques. From the gameplay videos provided by the modder, the character appears to work quite well.</p>



<p>However, one specific ability, <em>"Thread Softly,"</em> may cause certain enemies without specific animations to stop moving for the remainder of the fight. Such minor technical issues are expected with mods that radically alter gameplay, and in no way diminish the incredible work that went into making a boss character playable.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Rufus Shinra isn't the only boss that has been made playable in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released earlier this year. Back in April, D3DNier released a mod which made the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turks Rude and Reno playable</a>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent updates</a> not only improving the two characters' behavior in combat, but also adding playable Elena and Tseng.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth combat experience is also set to be further expanded in the future by <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-zack-gameplay-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Zack gameplay overhaul </a>that will massively expand the character's moveset to better represent the power a 1st Class SOLDIER is supposed to have, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion.</a></p>



<p>As development of the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is well underway, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is on sale on Black Friday 2025 on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, is not getting expanded with new content, so mods such as these are the perfect way to experience the game with some new twists.</p>



<p>The mods that are sure to be developed for the third and final entry in the series, however, may not be the only way the yet-to-be formally announced game will be expanded. Director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed to us during this year's Tokyo Game Show that there's<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a concrete possibility of having a DLC for the final game, or even a full title.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paradox Announces $37 Million Write-Down After Bloodlines 2 Fails to Meet Sales Estimates, But the DLCs Are Still Happening]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/paradox-announces-37-million-writedown-bloodlines-2-fails-meet-sales-estimates/</link>
            <guid>1366345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a press release shared late yesterday evening, Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 failed to meet its sales estimates. Due to the game's underperformance, the publisher has been forced to make a non-cash write-down of around $37 million in 'capitalized development costs'.</p>



<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said that the company is proud of the work done by The Chinese Room (which replaced the original developer, Hardsuit Labs), but also admitted that the sales will not match the projections. In a refreshing move, the executive took the blame on the publisher's side instead of blaming the developers as so often happens nowadays, adding that Paradox's lack of expertise in the action RPG genre made it challenging to gauge the game's sales properly.</p>



<p>In the future, Wester vowed to return to the publisher's core market, which has always been in the grand strategy genre. Paradox's most accomplished games are, after all, Imperator: Rome, the Crusader Kings series, the Europa Universalis series (which has just received <a href="https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its fifth main installment</a>), the Victoria series, the Hearts of Iron series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellaris-out-of-this-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellaris</a>. This isn't surprising, as Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja already <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> last year that another Bloodlines title would be licensed out instead of developed internally.</p>



<p>Indeed, Fredrik Wester said:</p>



<p><em>We’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.</em></p>



<p>That said, Paradox confirmed that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is still getting its two DLCs as planned, as well as other free post-launch updates. In the DLCs, players will find themselves in the shoes of different characters: Loose Cannon is focused on the former Sheriff of the Seattle Court, Benny Muldoon, whereas The Flower &amp; the Flame lets you play as the Toreador vampire Ysabella. The first DLC will be available in Q2 2026, with the second DLC following in Q3.</p>



<p>Recently, former The Chinese Room Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-bloodlines-2-creative-director-wanted-to-call-the-game-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that he attempted to persuade Paradox to change the game's name because the studio lacked the time and resources to create a proper Bloodlines game. Alas, the publisher did not relent, and the result is abysmal sales and mixed reviews.</p>



<p>I somewhat enjoyed my time with Bloodlines 2, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in the review</a> that its several flaws only warranted purchase at a much lower price, and even then, only for fans of Vampire: The Masquerade. </p>
