			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> added more than just an Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint to Croteam's classic puzzle game, The Talos Principle. It added a new suite of puzzles with the new In the Beginning expansion, which was made in collaboration with select members of the game's community.</p>
<p>16 out of the 18 puzzles included in the expansion are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">community-made</a>, and they also happen to be some of the most challenging puzzles within the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the puzzle Sequence Break. Before I go into the solution, if all you want is a hint, stop here before scrolling further.</p>
<p>The hint I'll give is that the puzzle's title already suggests its solution, but think of it as a 'recording break' instead of a 'sequence break.'</p>
<p>That's about as much of a hint I can give without giving away the whole solution, but if that's what you were looking for, then follow these steps below.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Sequence Break Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area for Sequence Break, you'll see a recorder to your left and the tetromino you're trying to reach behind a couple of laser walls to your right. The puzzle is mostly solved with elements on the left side of the room, right up until the final steps, where you'll head over to the right side to grab the tetromino once you've solved the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Nothing happens without the recorder, so start the recording and walk over to the connector standing on a pressure switch on your right. Pick up the connector and connect it to the red laser generator around the corner. Once it's set, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Leaving the connector where it is, walk over to the pressure switch it was initially on and stand on top of it. Create another pause point here. Once both pause points are set, grab the connector and place it back on the pressure switch so you can exit the area and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the recording plays, quickly grab the connector and stand at the end of the laneway across from where your recorded self will place the recorded connector. Use the connector to connect to the red laser and red node to your right, along with the recorded connector, and the red node on the opposite side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Play the recording until your recorded self is standing on the pressure switch, and walk back into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Then, continue the recording. Once your recorded self is off the pressure switch, instead of letting the recording play out, hit 'Stop' on the recorder. You should be left with the connector sending the red laser across the puzzle area to the node that will unlock the shield blocking the way to the tetromino, which is currently blocked by the shield that is deactivated with the pressure switch that sits in front of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Make a new recording. Walk over to the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area and stand on it to deactivate the shield. Create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Stop the recording, and let it play up to the pause point. Once it's there, your recorded self will have deactivated the shield, allowing the red laser to hit the node that will deactivate the shield to the tetromino.</li>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino to complete the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how you solve the Sequence Break puzzle in the new In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened. Like many of these puzzles, it's a clever trick that unlocks everything. In the case of Sequence Break, that trick is stopping the recording and not letting the entire thing play out, so you can have the red laser hitting the node across the puzzle room to the one that will unlock the path to the tetromino.</p>
