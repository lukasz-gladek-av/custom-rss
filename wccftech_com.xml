			<p>Less than three months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">state of Louisiana announced it would be filing a lawsuit</a> against Roblox, which claimed that the company "<em></em><em>permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana</em>," the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Petition_0.pdf">filed his own lawsuit</a> against Roblox with similar allegations and similarly intense language, as Paxton alleges the company put "<em>pixel pedophiles and profits over</em> <em>the safety of Texas children</em>."</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-texas">press release</a> regarding the lawsuit, Paxton says, "<em>We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed. Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law</em>."</p>



<p>It's intense language, to say the least, and while Roblox Corporation would disagree with it and, in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-must-do-more-to-protect-kids-from-sick-and-twisted-freaks-texas-attorney-general-says-as-he-sues-roblox-for-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-ahead-of-kids/">PC Gamer</a>, said Paxton's claims and lawsuit were "<em>based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims</em>," there is no denying that Roblox has garnered a reputation for being a platform riddled with safety concerns for children.</p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">multiple reports</a> in recent years that have deeply investigated Roblox for its lack of child safety protocols. In 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg reported</a> that in 2023, there were 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform, with Roblox employees quoted in the report saying the company was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in the fight against child predators on the platform.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>People Make Games published two in-depth videos that explored issues of child predators on the platform and the issues of Roblox's dependence on user-created content and how little those creators actually see compared to the profits that Roblox Corporation rakes in.</p>

So We Dug Deeper." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTMF6xEiAaY?start=1030&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's worth noting that Roblox has <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/tech-talks-update-on-roblox-safety-initiatives">made several changes since both the above videos were published</a>, but there is a case to be made that those <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">changes were implemented too late</a>, and it's also worth asking if the changes are actually doing enough to make it a safe platform for children.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that Louisiana and Texas aren't the only states in the US going after Roblox. <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/2025.10.06%20-%20%5bFINAL%5d%20KY%20Roblox%20Complaint.pdf">Kentucky has a similar lawsuit filed</a> against the company, and <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937">Florida has launched a criminal investigation</a> into Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox, for its part, as stated earlier, calls the Texas attorney general's claims "<em>sensationalized</em>," and goes further to say that it is "<em>deeply committed to child safety</em>." </p>

			<p>Destiny 2 was namedropped today during Sony's Q2 2025 investors call, and not in a positive way. Lin Tao, CFO (Corporate Financial Officer) at Sony Group Corporation, explained that the game's sales have been lower than expected when Sony acquired its developer, Bungie, thus forcing the Japanese corporation to record an impairment loss of 31.5 billion yen, which translates to roughly $204 million at current exchange rates.</p>



<p><em>Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectation we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie. While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie.</em></p>



<p>Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the acquisition of Bungie in early 2022. They spent the huge sum of $3.6 billion, which analysts like Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believed was disproportionate to the value of the studio</a>. The main objective was for Sony to add live service experts to its portfolio, but it's not really paying off, with Destiny 2's Steam numbers <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping significantly</a> and the delay of their next game, the first-person extraction shooter Marathon.</p>



<p>Destiny 2 will try to pick itself up with Renegades, the Star Wars-inspired expansion that goes live on December 2, featuring cool new weapons such as lightsabers. But Bungie's real test will be Marathon, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to launch before March 2026</a>. If it failed, it could spell doom for the once-acclaimed developer. </p>

<p>For its part, Sony can rest easy knowing that Helldivers 2, on the other hand, is doing very well. Following its launch on Xbox, the game continues to attract new players on PlayStation 5 and PC, and its sales have significantly increased year-over-year. Despite several blunders (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Concord</a>), live service revenue accounts for 40% of PlayStation's first-party revenue.</p>



<p>In the Q2 2025 financial report, Sony also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that PS5 shipments have reached 84.2 million units, while the game Ghost of Yōtei sold more than 3.3 million units in its first month.</p>
