			<p>The <strong>turbulence at Microsoft's Xbox division</strong> continued on Friday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the company suddenly announced</a> that long-time CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and current president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> were both <strong>leaving</strong> (the former is retiring, while the latter is pursuing other career opportunities outside Microsoft).</p>



<p>The new CEO of Microsoft Gaming is <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, whose appointment is, however, already being questioned by gamers. The 36-year-old executive <strong>has no prior experience in the gaming industry</strong>; browsing her career, this is actually the second time she's been at Microsoft. She first joined Microsoft in 2011 and worked in the Marketing department for two years, then left to become COO of <strong>Porch Group</strong> (an insurance platform for homes), then returned to the tech industry by joining <strong>Meta</strong> as Head of Product across Messenger + Instagram Direct and GM of calling, video, and kids experiences. </p>



<p>In 2021, she changed companies again, joining the leading grocery technology company <strong>Instacart</strong> as its COO. After three years, she returned to Microsoft as president of the <strong>CoreAI</strong> product, leading the portfolio of AI models, apps, agents, responsible AI, and developer tools for customers.</p>



<p>It's not so much her lack of industry experience that worries gamers, but rather <strong>her previous work in Microsoft's AI division</strong>. Probably aware of this in advance, Sharma included this reassuring bit in her prepared statement:</p>



<p><em>We will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.</em></p>



<p>However, she didn't quite get off to the right start with that. Throughout the weekend, her X account replied to several gamers in an attempt to connect with the Xbox community, but <strong>fans are already pointing out that her answers might actually be crafted by an AI bot</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025271504515285467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's an example</a>:</p>



<p><em>Great list. I did my top 3 in another reply. Halo, Valheim, 007. It's been a long time since I played Chrono Trigger. Have you done every ending? Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it a ton.</em></p>



<p>Furthermore, the new Xbox CEO has shared her Gamertag publicly, and fans quickly noticed a couple of things: it was created last month and already has quite a bit of playtime. She later <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025262170339168355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in a tweet</a> that she's "<strong>no Phil Spencer</strong>", hinting at the previous CEO's renowned gaming habits.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not mandatory for a gaming executive to be a gamer. However, between that, her lack of experience in the industry, and the aforementioned AI skepticism, <strong>Asha Sharma might already have a bit of an uphill battle when it comes to winning over the already downbeat Xbox fans</strong>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. If Xbox can output great hardware and software, all this stuff will be quickly forgotten. The lineup for this year (which marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox) is very solid: <strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though of course, it was inherited from the previous leadership. </p>
