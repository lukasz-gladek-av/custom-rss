			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a>, we got new looks at 16 games. Some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">were new announcements and reveals</a>, others were first looks at gameplay. The trailer we saw for The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu falls in the latter camp, with our first real look at gameplay for the upcoming four-player online co-op game from ACE Team and Nacon.</p>



<p>First announced <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/nacon-and-ace-team-announce-co-op-horror-game-the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">back in March 2025</a>, it was initially set to arrive sometime before the end of this year. Then, in August, <a href="https://x.com/PlayTheMound/status/1956353464801321128">Nacon and ACE Team delayed its launch to 2026</a>. Now, have a more defined release window, with the studios announcing that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S at some point in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu puts you into the shoes of one of four players, all stuck on an island, trying to survive a cursed jungle that will warp their reality, making it difficult to tell the difference between allies and enemies.</p>

<p>Not only are you dealing with mind-bending phenomena, you're dealing with an older class of weapons that cause their own anxieties simply due to the fact that if you miss your first shot, you might not get the chance to reload a second with these old-school rifles.</p>



<p>This trailer, short as it is, was our first proper look at gameplay, while still emphasizing the dark atmosphere and tone the game is going for. It'll be interesting to see how ACE Team and Nacon lean into its 16th-century setting and its Lovecraftian inspirations. </p>
