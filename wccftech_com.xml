			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/No-Mans-Land-Screeshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>

			<p>Though Black Friday deals usually start ahead of the actual date, there are always still deals that only appear on the day itself, which is why it's still worth keeping your eye out for deals and waiting for the actual day. Well, anyone who was patient enough to wait for it to actually be Black Friday in order to take advantage of deals on video games has been rewarded, because there's a slew of games, all of which were released in 2025, that you can grab for $40 or less on Amazon.</p>



<p>Of course, you can find older games for cheap as well, and some other 2025 releases on sale for more than $40, but no one is able to grab everything they want in a given year right at launch, so there's likely a few games in this list of 20 titles released in 2025 that you can pick up for cheap now.</p>



<p>Starting from the top-end of the pricing, with games that you can pick up for $40 that were released in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/44rIXxQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Xbox Series X - $40</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3M4IXh0" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Hell is Us - PS5/Xbox Series X - $40</a></li>
