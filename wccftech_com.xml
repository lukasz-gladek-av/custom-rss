			<p>A The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake powered by Unreal Engine 5 could be in the works, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222, a Technical Art Director at Chinese development studio Virtuos Games is listing among the games they have worked on an unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. While the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda is not mentioned anywhere on the online resume, Virtuos Games has long been rumored to be the developer behind the Oblivion remaster revealed back in September 2023 via some <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">leaked slides</a>, so there's the chance the remaster could actually be a full-blown remake. However, as Virtuos is also the studio behind Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake, there's also the chance the employee simply hasn't updated the resume since the game was officially announced. As such, we have to take this with a grain of salt until this project is officially revealed.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned leaked slides, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion isn't the only older game developed by Bethesda poised to return to modern hardware, as a Fallout 3 remaster is supposedly in the works as well. Both of these projects have yet to be officially revealed, however, so there's the chance that plans may have been changed since 2022, when the leaked slides were shared with the FTC.</p>
<p>If The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion never gets remade or remastered, however, fans will still be able to experience an updated version of the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">Skyblivion</a> mod. The total conversion project, which will recreate the game in Skyrim, will be released later this year, although it will lack the conversion of the DLC expansions, which will come at a later time.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill has been working at a neck-breaking pace lately. Just yesterday, we got our first proper look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new JoyCon controller</a>, thanks to a leak from China. Fans immediately noticed its much larger shoulder buttons than the original Switch controller, as shown in the comparison picture below.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The comparison between Switch 2 and Switch 1 joy-cons. Look at those massive top buttons! ðŸ’™ <a href="https://t.co/jcQel893Bg">pic.twitter.com/jcQel893Bg</a></p>
<p>â€” Mucrush ðŸ¦‹ (@Mucrush) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mucrush/status/1875892254189162537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, a new rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hue20a/switch_2_shipping_data_indicates_the_joycons_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that the new JoyCons could also be used similarly to PC mice. This stems from shipping data listing component parts as 'mouse soles'. Insider NextHandheld had also previously <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hh6flf/unexthandheld_could_be_hinting_that_the_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the controller's laser sensors will allow it to be used that way, as we've already seen with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-handheld-with-amd-ryzen-z1-apus-official-starts-at-e799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a> PC handheld. It could definitely be an interesting new approach for Nintendo Switch 2 gaming.</p>
<p>On a completely separate note, insider Nash Weedle has <a href="https://twitter.com/NWeedle/status/1873657637927338043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873657637927338043%7Ctwgr%5Ebb0b8b52fbe2d6bbc48c4823ef81f0d8f5a12f58%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-no-mans-sky-to-land-on-nintendo-switch-2-1477163%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> quite clearly that No Man's Sky will be released for Nintendo's new console. This isn't earth-shattering news, as the game is already available on the regular Switch, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022 after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/near-impossible-no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'near-impossible' porting process</a>. The new console is also backward compatible, so the game's compatibility with the system was a given. Weedle probably hints at a new version of No Man's Sky optimized to take advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware improvements; while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-performance-range-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as powerful as Microsoft's Xbox Series S</a>, the upcoming hybrid console is rumored to be around the PlayStation 4 Pro, with certain built-in advantages over Sony's console like NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. As such, No Man's Sky should certainly look and run a lot better on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be no exaggeration to say that Nintendo fans are nearly frothing in anticipation of the Japanese console manufacturer and game developer/publisher's official announcement. The reveal might come <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as this week</a>, so stay tuned.</p>
