			<p>A Halo 5: Guardians PC port was originally considered, but was later scrapped due to technical hurdles, according to a former member of the development team.</p>
<p>Former Halo developer Tyler Owens confirmed on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/heytred" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that a PC port of the fifth entry in the popular Microsoft series was originally being considered but ran into "significant" tech hurdles and was later scrapped. The developer could not say which technical hurdles ultimately prevented the port, but there's a good chance it was due to the frame rate being tied to the physics, which was something that many developers were doing at the time the game was in development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I wish but it’s never going to happen imo. I think the port that was being considered ran into significant tech hurdles and was scrapped.</p>
<p>— Tyler Owens (@heytred) <a href="https://twitter.com/heytred/status/1850597419437916476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Probably, seems plausible - l honestly wasn’t as connected to high levels details on my role at the time.</p>

<p>While an official PC port of Halo 5: Guardians may never see the light of day, PC players will still be able to experience the game in some capacity in the future, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-5-guardians-pc/">XWine1 Xbox One translation layer</a>, which can already run the game in its current state. The layer has yet to be released to the public, but work is continuing <a href="https://x.com/XWineOne/status/1849794366216319198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily, </a>so it may not be long before the game will be available to players who don't have access to Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Halo 5: Guardians is now available on Xbox One, but it can also be played on any device that supports Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

			<p>God of War Ragnarök PC has received a new patch update, explicitly focusing on performance improvements for AMD's "older" CPUs, notably Zen1 and Zen2.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök was indeed a significant port by Jetpack Interactive when it comes to debuting with optimized performance and a bug-free experience, and with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-patch-4-frame-generation-improvements/">constant patch updates released by the developers</a> post-launch, it certainly has made the title a refined piece, especially when compared against other PC ports. Now, the latest Patch 6 (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/16143442/">SteamDB</a>) has brought in further refinements, explicitly focusing on consumers with older AMD CPUs, and has provided performance improvements in areas where the game was "CPU limited."</p>
<h4 id="updates"><em><strong>Updates</strong></em></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash in UI when opening certain Journal pages</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could happen when controllers get disabled or enabled in rapid succession</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that would occur in various locations in Vanaheim</em></li>
<li><em>Improved performance of AMD Zen1 and Zen2 processors in areas where the game was CPU limited</em></li>
<li><em>Increased tessellation in Realm Between Realms back to PS5 quality</em></li>
<li><em>Note that the performance issue related to tessellation is resolved in NVIDIA drivers 565.90 or higher</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where lock on would rapidly bounce between targets when using mouse. It will now be more "sticky" requiring more effort to change targets</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where attack indicators would not look correct when using frame generation</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where cinematic dialogue audio would be lower volume than intended</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the performance improvements, the new Update 6 also brings fixes to crashes in locations such as Vanaheim and enhancements to the UI of certain Journal Pages. There have also been optimizations with Frame Generation, so the update is constructive for improving user experience. We haven't seen the improvements the new update has brought in with older AMD CPUs, but we shouldn't expect out-of-the-roof bumps in performance.</p>
<p>Steam will automatically download the update when you get the title running next time, and if you haven't experienced the game yet, you can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">&nbsp;review.</a></p>
