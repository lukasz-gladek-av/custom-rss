			<p>If Hollow Knight Silksong was the only platformer released in 2025, that alone would make 2025 a great year for platformers. Thankfully, as you'll know by checking out our picks for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Best Platformers of 2025</a>, there was more than Hollow Knight Silksong to be excited about.</p>



<p>Now that Silksong is out, we platformer fans can stop waiting for its release and look forward to what's coming in 2026. Here are Wccftech's picks for the Most Anticipated Platformers for 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tomb-Raider-Legacy-of-Atlantis.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Image credit: Amazon Game Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft is making yet another comeback, and this time, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog Studios are bringing players back to how things were when she raided tombs on the original PlayStation in 1996. Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original game, in all of its adventuring and 3D platforming glory, with a massive visual upgrade to go along with it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/">reveal at The Game Awards</a> showed off a small clip of gameplay, which showed that while you'll definitely spend a fair amount of time shooting raptors while duel-wielding pistols, you'll also be jumping to avoid traps and clear obstacles like you would have back in the 90s. Obviously, at this point, we don't know how much of the gameplay will focus on platforming, but it doesn't seem to be tossed to the side. There's definitely more than a small chance that it is one of the more engaging platformers in 2026, and hopefully it lives up to that expectation.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bloodstained-The-Scarlet-Engagement.png"></a><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Image credit: 505 Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>All of the Bloodstained games are 2D platformers, but within them are two different art styles. The Curse of the Moon games are both pixel art, more classic-era Castlevania-looking games, while the Ritual of the Night and one of our picks, the Scarlet Engagement, have a more modern, 2D/3D style with more detailed character models.</p>



<p>Hundreds of games have tried to capture the magic of the original Castlevania games, but Bloodstained has been consistently successful at presenting Castlevania nostalgia while still maintaining its own flavour. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-the-night-is-still-young/">Ritual of the Night is arguably one of the better</a> of the three currently available Bloodstained games, and by the time The Scarlet Engagement arrives, it'll have been seven years since it came out on PC and last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Hopefully, The Scarlet Engagement can pick up where Ritual of the Night left off and deliver a platforming experience that can stand amongst the best of its contemporaries.</p>



<h2 id="h-yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoshi-and-the-Mysterious-Book-Announced.png"></a><figcaption><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Platforming fans everywhere are still waiting for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> reveal (a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-fans-stay-tuned-future-nintendo-directs-hints-miyamoto-mobile-focus-done/">new 3D Mario platformer</a>), but Yoshi's Island fans are in good shape because we have Yoshi and the Mysterious Book to look forward to.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-nintendo-switch-2-spring-2026/">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> is the first new Yoshi game since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/">Yoshi's Crafted World in 2019</a>, making this the second game on this list that'll have a seven-year gap between its most recent series entry. We haven't seen too much of the game, but its likeness to Yoshi's Island is undeniable. If that inspiration follows through to its gameplay, then we'll have one of the better 2D platformers Nintendo has put out in a while on our hands.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-may-29-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight (May 29, 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-Release-Date-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. Image credit: Warner Bros.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO games have always been a mix of puzzle-platforming with some light combat and adventuring, and even though LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks like it'll be the most expansive, most open-world-like game in the modern era of LEGO games yet, there's no reason to believe it won't include plenty of 3D platforming.</p>



<p>It seems like it'll have a bit more of an Arkham-style focus on combat and open-world mechanics, but it's still a LEGO game. There's a good chance some of the combat focus the Arkham games have will be swept away for more platforming, and TT Games has more than proven capable of creating some excellent platforming adventures. It's good to have a Batman game we can actually look forward to, instead of one where no one is all that convinced it'll be worth checking out, only to be proven right (looking at you, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/">Gotham Knights</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">Suicide Squad</a>).</p>



<h2 id="h-darwin-s-paradox-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">Darwin's Paradox (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Darwins-Paradox.png"></a><figcaption><em>Darwin's Paradox. Image credit: Konami</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Our last but in no way least pick of our most anticipated games, Darwin's Paradox, is a real fish-out-of-water scenario as you take on the role of a blue octopus that is quite literally out of his natural habitat. Getting back to the ocean and getting back home is the ultimate goal, and along the way you'll be put into what looks like more than a few tricky platforming situations.</p>



<p>Darwin's Paradox looks like it'll be a strong spectacle when it comes to its visual presentation and a few core set-pieces throughout the game's story, and hopefully, it's able to lean on the squiggly and sticky nature of the octopus to create some inventive platforming scenes.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As is the case with every category, not everything we're looking forward to in 2026 can make our main list. The following are our honourable mentions for our most anticipated platformers for 2026.</p>



<p>But before that, a huge asterisk on our main list. Our top honourable mention is an Unannounced Mario 3D platformer, because when it launches, it'll likely be the most significant game for the genre since Super Mario Odyssey. But without any actual announcement, it didn't feel right having it take the place of another game that we actually know will arrive this year. </p>



<p>It was already a shock that the Nintendo Switch 2 didn't launch with a new Mario platformer, so we can't exactly bet on it happening in 2026. So if you felt its absence from the main list, that's why. With that out of the way, here are our honourable mentions.</p>



<ul>
<li>Unannounced Mario 3D Platformer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-release-date-tarsier-studios/">Reanimal</a></li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">High on Life 2</a></li>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-ps-plus-essential-january-2026/">Shortly after the headlining game for January's PS Plus Essential titles leaked</a>, PlayStation has come out and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">announced the full PS Plus Essential lineup</a> for the first month of 2026. Not only does it include Need for Speed Unbound, but all PS Plus subscribers will be able to enjoy Epic Mickey Rebrushed and Core Keeper.</p>



<p>It's back to the three-game norm, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">December 2025's lineup of Essential titles</a> included five games total. While Need for Speed is the headliner, it's arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/">Epic Mickey Rebrushed</a> that's the most exciting title of the bunch. Core Keeper isn't a slouch either, as the 1-8 player co-op game is a good option to cozy up with as we get into the cold of January.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available for players to redeem as of January 6, 2026, which means that you'll have until January 5, 2026, to redeem the five games that were made available to players in December 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2026 Is About “Staying Grounded and Laying Solid Foundations,” Says Hideo Kojima As Work Continues on OD and Physint]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-kojima-productions-2026-about-staying-grounded-laying-solid-foundations/</link>
            <guid>1394989</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima has delivered his Happy New Year message to the world, as it's already 2026 in his home of Japan. Along with well-wishes for the new year, he's provided an update on what 2026 will mean for Kojima Productions, and according to Kojima, it means he's getting his head down and rooting himself in his home and his work.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has been out the door for months, the studio can look ahead at its next major projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">OD and Physint</a>. According to Kojima, this is part of Kojima Productions moving forward with the "<em>Second Phase that leads into Kojima Productions 'Third Phase.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Happy New Year,</em>" Kojima began in his post on his <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?s=20">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>In 2026, we will move forward with the 'Second Phase' that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ 'Third Phase'.”</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unlike last year, I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development on the horror game 'OD' and move forward with preparations for the espionage action title 'PHYSINT.' This includes casting actors, scanning, and performance capture shoots.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy New Year.<br>In 2026, we will move forward with the “Second Phase” that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ “Third Phase.”<br>Unlike last year, like I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development… <a href="https://t.co/yje0zAY1md">pic.twitter.com/yje0zAY1md</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It sounds like Kojima sees the year ahead as a time to really dig into Physint and OD, and while Death Stranding 2 being out of the way means he and the rest of the studio can focus on both games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/">both titles are seemingly still early in development.</a> In other words, barring some incredible surprise, we won't be seeing a new game from Kojima Productions in 2026.</p>



<p>Beyond the studio's upcoming game projects, Hideo Kojima also <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/">shared an update on the multiple adaptations in the works based on Death Stranding</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Also, be pushing forward with the live-action film of DEATH STRANDING, as well as its animation projects, both the movie and series. In addition, we’re preparing several 'events' this year. Once things are finalized, I’ll be able to share more.</em>"</p>



<p>So while 2026 likely won't be marked by a new game under Kojima's and the studios' belt, it will still be a significant one for Hideo Kojima as he enters the year of his 40th anniversary in game development. "This year also marks my 40th anniversary in the game industry, from 1986, and began my journey in game creation.<em> Thank you, as always, for your continued support and supporting Kojima Productions. I look forward to another great year</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mistborn-author-is-talking-to-aaa-game-studios-adapt-fantasy-saga/</link>
            <guid>1394911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the latest edition of the so-called '<strong><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of the Sanderson</a></strong>', the yearly recap that the popular fantasy author writes to let his fans know what he's worked on and what's next, <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> revealed that he's been talking to triple-A game companies to make a <strong>Mistborn game</strong> happen. Here's the relevant quote from the blog post:</p>



<p><em>I’ve started to get some real interest on the video game front, and I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. To that end, I’ve started talking to some AAA developers. This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging one. These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last… oh, six~seven years, so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m trying to do things differently this time in an effort to retain control of my video game rights. I already have interest from some major players in the Video Game industry (who I like a lot). So if you are a decision maker at a AAA studio, or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a Mistborn or Stormlight game… well, you would want to contact my reps now.</em></p>



<p>The key change is that Sanderson had unwisely decided to license the film and game rights together, and ultimately, neither thing happened. In October 2016, the author selected DMG Entertainment as the licensee of not just Mistborn but the entire <strong>Cosmere</strong> (Sanderson's fantasy universe, where most of his books are set), and an adaptation of Mistborn: The Final Empire was planned, but the project stalled.</p>



<p>Presumably, the gaming rights have now reverted to the author, who is now free to seek a new partner for the game adaptation. There once was a project called Mistborn: Birthright, announced in 2012 and developed by Little Orbit (which would later be infamously known for the failure of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029260/Unsung_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsung Story</a>), but it was canceled.</p>



<p>Sanderson himself is a massive gamer. In early 2022, he made headlines when he jokingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/brandon-sanderson-complains-about-fromsoftwares-choice-of-george-r-r-martin-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complained</a> that<strong> FromSoftware</strong> had picked <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> author <strong>G.R.R. Martin</strong> to help them create the mythos of <strong>Elden Ring</strong>. He did contribute to a game shortly afterward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-series-developer-announces-turn-based-tactical-game-moonbreaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working with <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong> on the turn-based strategy game <strong>Moonbreaker</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Still, there's no question that he's very excited about the prospect of a triple-A game set on <strong>Scadrial</strong> (the world where Mistborn takes place). As a massive fan of all things Sanderson, Mistborn very much included, I am equally intrigued. There's a lot of potential for an action RPG here, especially with the incredibly deep mythology already established by Sanderson and the cool allomancy and feruchemy magic systems.</p>



<p>Who would you pick as the ideal developer of a Mistborn game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>It's almost 2026, and while a new year is always exciting, a new month means another batch of PS Plus games is headed towards PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier subscribers. In what has practically become a monthly tradition, a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has revealed one of the games that kicks off the year for PS Plus Essential subscribers: Need for Speed Unbound.</p>



<p>The latest Need for Speed game in the franchise, Unbound arrived on current-gen consoles on December 2, 2022. It was a more-than-solid racer at the time of its launch, though it wasn't able to reach the highs that made the series so iconic. Though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-charging-5-dollars-to-unlock-map-markers-new-races-challenges/">decidedly fell off the radar of players not too long after its debut,</a> developer Criterion Games and Codemasters have done a good job of updating it with multiple drops of new cars, tracks, challenge modes, etc. </p>



<p>As Wccftech's Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/">put it in his review of the game at launch</a>, "<em>Need for Speed Unbound is the franchise’s best entry in a decade, although the competition for that title wasn't particularly stiff. The game offers polished tech, good (if slightly dated) open-world design, and a varied array of events and challenges, but still lags behind the current open-world racer pack leaders. The fantasy of becoming an underground racing champ is also hampered by a restrictive, ill-considered progression system. Nostalgic fans will find plenty to like here, and more general players might want to consider a test drive once the game is marked down, but “need” may be a strong word to attach to Criterion’s latest.</em>"</p>



<p>The game's last major update, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-unbound/news/end-of-kaizen-review">Volume 9, arrived earlier in 2025,</a> though Criterion has had its focus shift away from Need for Speed while it worked on delivering Battlefield 6 this past October. Its arrival as a PS Plus Essential game will technically be the second time it has been added to PlayStation's subscription service, as it was made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-february-2024-assassins-creed-valhalla-nfs-unbound-tales/">PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalog title back in February 2024</a>.</p>



<p>So, unfortunately for those subscribers, you're technically getting one game less than you otherwise would if Unbound weren't already available to subscribers on the Extra or above tiers. Though there's always the chance that an added game coming to Extra and Premium subscribers only will make up for it.</p>



<p>It should also be mentioned that, while Billbil-kun has an immaculate record at this point when it comes to announcing PS Plus titles early (they've almost never been wrong), it is still an unofficial report at the time of this writing. So take it for what it's worth. </p>



<p>If you don't believe it'll be one of the three free games for Essential subscribers, and you wouldn't mind starting your 2026 by checking it out, then you can always grab it on the PS Store with the Ultimate Collection edition, currently at 85% off for PlayStation's Holiday Sale.</p>
