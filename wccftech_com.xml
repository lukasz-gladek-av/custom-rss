			<p>Epic Games has been involved in intense <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-returns-to-iphone-in-australia-after-epic-games-wins-legal-battle-against-apple-and-google-marking-major-shift-in-app-store-rules-and-player-freedom/">legal battles with both Apple</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/">Google for years now</a>, though last week, it seemed like this era of Epic's battles with Google was coming to an end. The two sides <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-google-finally-reach-settlement-open-android-platform-lower-service-fees/">reached a settlement last week</a> that seemed to please everyone involved, and all that was left was for the presiding judge, Judge James Donato, to slap his stamp of approval on the deal.</p>



<p>In the proposed settlement, the Android platform would become more open, and Google would lower its service fees for Google Play. Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, called the settlement "<em></em><em>a comprehensive solution</em>" to the dispute and would have definitively concluded the legal battle between the two.</p>



<p>Except Judge James Donato is not exactly convinced that he can approve this settlement, and has a few lingering concerns, including a concern around why Epic and Google, after years of legal vitriol back and forth, "<em>are suddenly BFFs</em>."</p>



<p>Reported by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/epic-games-google-settlement-under-review-as-us-judge-raises-concerns">80 Level</a>, Judge Donato's concern, besides the fact that the two juggernaut companies suddenly seem like best friends, is that the proposed settlement does not reach the legal threshold needed for Judge Donato to revise a court ruling.</p>



<p>"<em>The only changed circumstance that I can see right now is Epic and Google - two mortal enemies who pounded each other relentlessly in this courtroom for many years - are suddenly BFFs</em>," said Donato, per 80 Level.</p>



<p>Another hearing has been set for sometime between December 2025 and January 2026, giving Judge Donato time to review the proposed settlement and its potential implications, should he approve it as it currently is.</p>

			<p>Ahead of their launch later this week, NVIDIA has reminded players of a few more titles that will be launching with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4, including Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/">new rally racing game from Supernova Games Studios and 505 Games</a>, which also marks the first time the Assetto Corsa series has ventured into the world of rally racing. It was built on an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine that has been the foundation for the entire Assetto Corsa series. Assetto Corsa Rally is also the second Assetto Corsa release of the year after Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation when it launches in early access on November 13, 2025, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 needs no introduction as the latest entry in the long-running annual shooter series, which is launching this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is another new entry in a long-running series, though a very different kind of game from Call of Duty. This new city-builder and strategy game puts players in Ancient Rome and charges them with deciding between instituting Roman traditions in its new Celtic colonies, or if you'll kick off a new era of Ancient Rome, letting Celtic traditions mix with Rome's to create something entirely new.</p>



<p>It'll arrive on PC on November 13, 2025, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_n_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/">Chip n' Clawz vs. The Brainoids</a> is a new action-strategy game from developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games from the creator of XCOM, Julian Gollop. It's a mix of third-person action and real-time strategy gameplay, and after launching earlier this year in August, it'll add support for DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Black Ops 7, and Assetto Corsa Rally will <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">also be available to play through NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
