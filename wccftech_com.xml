			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is considerably more powerful than its predecessor, but a recent online comparison shows the original Switch could have held its own better against the new console with a few key hardware tweaks.</p>



<p>The video comparison shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> compares loading speed, handheld and docked performance in multiple games, and battery life between the current generation Nintendo system and <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-playstation-3-games-rpcs3/">an overclocked modded "pro" version of a Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. The modded system's hardware includes an overclocked CPU (1707 MHz) and GPU (1724 MHz), 8 GB of RAM, an upgraded 8600 mAh battery, and modded cooling to prevent damage to the system.</p>



<p>While loading speed in games such as The Witcher 3, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is much faster on Nintendo Switch 2, the difference isn't massive in other games, such as Hogwarts Legacy. Even in terms of handheld and docked performance in backward-compatible games, the differences aren't huge. </p>



<p>In GRID Autosport in handheld mode, for example, the two systems are an almost complete match, with the Nintendo Switch 2 sporting better frametimes thanks to its more powerful CPU. Docked performance is also impressive on the modded Nintendo Switch, as Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at close to 60 FPS most of the time, although at a clearly lower resolution than the Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>In some unpatched games, however, the performance comparison between the two systems becomes more interesting. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the modded Nintendo Switch runs the game at smooth 60 FPS, as opposed to the locked 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. The modded system can run Metroid Prime Remastered at 1440p resolution while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. With Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the modded Nintendo Switch also has no trouble pushing the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, while the unpatched game on Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be locked at 30 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While comparing how unpatched backward compatible games run on the two systems may be a little unfair, the comparison shows how some design decisions, such as the limited amount of RAM, held back the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have similar constraints, and it shows, as it runs some PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports surprisingly well, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The new entry in the CAPCOM series, in particular, is setting out to be another benchmark release for the system, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">even the development team was surprised at how well the game runs on the system.</a></p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally launch on Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on January 22, 2026</a>. These versions of the game will include, from day one, a new feature called Streamlined Progression that essentially lets players enjoy the narrative without having to worry about difficulty, thanks to the ability to keep health and/or mana constantly full, to max out damage dealt, etc. </p>



<p>Streamlined Progression (which will also be added to the existing PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake with an update) was recently discussed once again by Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with AUTOMATON Japan</a>. Hamaguchi claimed that players should have the choice in how they wish to interact with game content.</p>



<p><em>The biggest reason was that we were finally able to announce the FFVII Remake trilogy’s multiplatform expansion. That timing was what really led to the decision to include Streamlined Progression. Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far. Sometimes it makes me wish I had access to debug functions so I could cover more.</em></p>



<p><em>Naturally, when we announce features like these, we get responses like ‘This is sacrilegious!’ Even within the dev team, there are people who feel that way. But unless someone takes the initiative, it doesn’t happen. I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it.</em></p>



<p>Hamaguchi added that Square Enix wouldn't add such a feature at launch for the third installment of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. In this context, though, with the game out for more than five years, they felt like it was an option they could provide. With Streamlined Progression, the game should be much quicker to complete: the developers estimate around 10 hours or even less for a playthrough, whereas a standard Final Fantasy VII Remake playthrough lasts between 40 and 50 hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is supposedly in co-development with a Virtuos game development studio, according to new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, Rebs Gaming, a source who has been consistently reliable with past Halo series rumors, revealed that <a href="https://abstraction.games/">Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos game development studio, is the team that's working on the remake together with Halo Studios.<a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/"> XboxEra</a> later corroborated the news, adding that the series' developer is the lead development studio of the project, so this isn't an external project.</p>



<p>In addition, Rebs Gaming also reiterated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/">Halo Combat Evolved remake will use both Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay</a>, highlighting again how the remake will combine a faithful gameplay recreation with some gameplay additions and modern visuals.</p>

(Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fd2XFc7zKcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming proved to be extremely reliable in the past, we have to take everything they have revealed about the Halo Combat Evolved remake with a massive grain of salt. However, considering Virtuos proved to be specializing in this hybrid-engine development this year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, it wouldn't be surprising for the developer to be attached to this project as well.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it won't take long to learn if the Halo Combat Evolved remake will be part of the series' future. Halo Studios will talk about what's next for their franchise during the<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept"> Halo World Championship later this month</a>, on October 24.</p>
