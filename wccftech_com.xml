			<p>Today, Arc Games and Snapshot Games (the creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/phoenix-point-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Point</a>) have announced a new title from XCOM creator Julian Gollop. The game is called Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids and it's a hybrid of action and strategy. Played from third-person view, it also offers the strategic depth of an RTS game, all set in a colorful, comic book-style world.</p>
<p>In Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, players must&nbsp; take the role of the heroes Chip or Clawz (or both characters in coop gameplay) to stop the Brainioid invasion. They will gather resources and collectibles, build bases, boost hero abilities, command minions, and fight alongside them in large-scale battles. The humorous story campaign features both normal and hard difficulty modes. There are also fast-paced, pick-up-and-play missions that, according to Snapshot, bring a modern twist to classic strategy games. There are even boss battles against the most powerful Brainioids.</p>
<p>In multiplayer, Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids supports army battles with or against your friends, including two-player couch co-op. There are also various online modes, from the classic online 1v1 to 2v2. Online multiplayer also supports cross-platform play on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Julian Gollop, CEO of Snapshot Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Snapshot Games, we recognize how much players really enjoy challenging real time strategy games but from our experience, we know that some players like a strategy game that’s easier to pick up and play, that’s a bit more action-packed and that’s fun to play with friends. With Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, we set out to create a dynamic and accessible action RTS experience that players can dive into together. We can’t wait for players to jump into the action, meet the game’s unique characters and enjoy the heroic adventures that await – starting with the demo in just a couple of days!</em></p>
