			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the decision of NetEase CEO William Ding</a>&nbsp;to pull out of several investments made across North America, Europe, and Japan, Quantic Dream fans were fearful about the studio's prospects. After all, the Paris-based developer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-has-been-acquired-by-netease-games-for-100-million-euros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> for ‚Ç¨100 million in February 2023. However, CEO and Head of Publishing Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re reassured them with a lengthy post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300062734602100737/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a>: the studio is unaffected.</p>
<p><em>We were deeply saddened to learn about the recent layoffs and studio closures affecting some of the NetEase group‚Äôs divisions. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted, and we sincerely hope that they quickly find new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>David Cage and I would like to express our gratitude to the fans and friends who have reached out to us in recent days regarding QUANTIC DREAM. We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations (please visit https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa for more details).</em></p>
<p><em>Founded 28 years ago, QUANTIC DREAM remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019, when NetEase initially acquired a minority stake in our company. Over the past six years, NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive. In 2022, QUANTIC DREAM became a wholly owned subsidiary of NetEase, aligning with our shared vision for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2024, we achieved the highest revenue in our history, driven by the exceptional performance of our back catalogue titles. Notably, Detroit: Become Human reached 11 million units in global sales across PlayStation and PC last year, a remarkable 2 million increase year-on-year, demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of our titles. The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future.</em></p>
<p>De Fondaumi√®re's mention of multiple projects is interesting, as we only publicly know about Star Wars: Eclipse. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021, the game is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting</a> a 2026 launch, although it could still be delayed further. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from Quantic Dream, the development was 'simmering' in September 2023. We also know that it will retain the studio's classic branching narrative while greatly expanding the gameplay with more action elements than in previous titles made by the developer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-introduces-significant-performance-boosts-at-every-resolution.1119261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Kingdom Come: Deliverance II mod now available online brings significant performance improvements by enabling Async Compute without conflicting with other mods.</p>
<p>The FPS Boost - Enables Async Compute mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/440?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, brings significant performance improvements, mostly on high-end hardware, by enabling the aforementioned tech that is disabled in the vanilla game. The performance boosts vary depending on the hardware, but they are still consistent at every resolution. As showcased in a new video put together by Compusemble, the mod brings a 9.83% average FPS boost at 4K resolution, highest Experimental settings, an 11.88% boost at 1440p, and a 14.52% boost at 1080p on an RTX 4090. Other users are reporting significant performance improvements on other GPUs as well, so the mod is definitely worth a try, although it comes with some reported issues, such as broken lighting effects during rain.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Async Compute Mod Delivers Free Performance Boost!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/glKXld7JNTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a performance boost is always welcome, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is one of the very few games released in the past few years that doesn't require mods to run acceptably on PC. The game developed by Warhorse is a polished day 1 experience that almost feels <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/">old school</a> in how it did not need any patch to improve either performance or image quality. The game also delivers on pretty much every other front, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Fable has been delayed to 2026 for a few different reasons, according to rumors circulating online, but the delay may not be all bad news for PlayStation 5 owners.</p>
<p>Well-known Xbox leaker eXtas1s reported in a new video that one of their sources who informed them about a possible delay for the new entry in the series at the end of last month, said Fable has been delayed to next year for a few reasons, which include technical reasons caused by the Forza engine that powers the game that has been created for racing games. Also, additional development time was required to make some other adjustments to the game, including gameplay adjustment and pace of progression improvements, as gameplay in one of its first forms wasn't considered too fun. While it wouldn't have been a proper Fable game without a delay caused by technical issues, the comments on gameplay are certainly more concerning, so hopefully, the additional development time will help in this regard.</p>
<p><iframe title="FABLE en PROBLEMAS! RETRASO 2026 por PS5 o GTA 6? üò® SORPRESA ACTIVISION GAMEPASS üü¢ XBOX EVENTO MARZO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRqCBq1OsI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While this unnamed source said that Fable hasn't been delayed specifically due to the development of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 ports</a>, a simultaneous console multiplatform launch is within the realms of possibility, according to well-known insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-136273683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a>. As the game was apparently scheduled to launch on other consoles one year after its PC and Xbox debut, it's definitely possible for Fable to launch on all consoles and PC at the same time in 2026.</p>
<p>The Fable delay to 2026 was confirmed yesterday during the latest episode of the official Xbox podcast. You can head over<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/"> here</a> to learn more about the announcement and check out some pre-alpha gameplay.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edge-of-memories-is-a-new-japanese-inspired-action-rpg-from-the-edge-of-eternity-devs-out-in-q4-2025.1119171/</guid>

			<p>After a few years of quiet, French developer Midgar Studio has announced Edge of Memories, a sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/edge-of-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge of Eternity</a>. However, while that game was a traditional JRPG, this one will be a full-fledged action RPG with real time combat, although still inspired by Japanese games in terms of art style and animation. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will be published by Nacon, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-eternity-developer-midgar-studio-acquired-by-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> the studio in 2022.</p>
<p>This time, the game takes place on the other side of the world of Heryon, on the continent of Avaris, where the nomadic inhabitants are also now battling the Corrosion plague. The protagonist is Eline, an itinerant Soul Whisperer who fights relentlessly against this force that is turning the once-thriving flora, fauna, and people of this lush land into grotesque abominations. After a mysterious encounter, a dark power awakens within her that may hold the key to ending this apocalypse: the ability to control the corrosion within her own body. She won't be alone in her journey, thanks to the presence of her mentor Ysoris and Kanta, the shaman prince of a lost tribe.</p>
<p>Edge of Memories features a combo-based combat system where players will have to alternate quick strikes and devastating techniques to be more efficient. Customizing companions and using their abilities in the most appropriate way will also be crucial to success. Lastly, Eline can transform into a berserker to deliver powerful blows and executions.</p>
<p>The continent of Avaris features various vibrant biomes, including the idyllic sandy shores of the port city of Sarlah-Durah and the snow-capped peaks of the Kezal Mountains. Players will traverse them with the help of a Nekaroo, a rideable and agile feline companion that helps the player reach otherwise inaccessible areas.&nbsp;According to the developers, as the story moves forward, the game transforms the places the player has traveled before, creating strange new paths for them to take. Midgar Studio also promises that there won't be any filler quests, each mission adding depth to either the story, the characters, or the relationships between them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vk8JHTjxoHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, there's good news on the soundtrack front, too. C√©dric Menendez is taking care of it, and the final theme features the voice of Emi Evans, known for her work on NieR: Automata, and the work of Yasunori Mitsuda, known for his work on games such as Chrono Trigger, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Sea of Stars. Edge of Memories is slated to launch in Q4 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738170/Edge_of_Memories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Pathologic 3: Quarantine is a free prologue for <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathologic 3</a>, and it will be released in just a few weeks, as revealed yesterday by developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher Hype Train Digital. It's been described as a story-driven adventure about a young scientist, Daniil Dankovsky, and his quest for immortality and a mysterious plague outbreak in a small town.&nbsp;Players will learn how the scientist's story began and what drove him to leave his acclaimed lab. They'll examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and take their first steps toward defeating death.</p>
<p>The developers have prepared a significant narrative twist: the narrative is told through unreliable narrators, including Dankovsky's subjective lens and the lens of his persecutors. The story is also said to be non-chronological. That is to say, it will be told out of order.</p>
<p>As a doctor, Dankovsky will try to fight the Sand Plague by examining and diagnosing patients, but also by investigating their lives to find out the unpleasant truths they may be hiding. He can also issue decrees based on new findings to save more lives. Moreover, Dankovsky has a sharp mind, and everything he sees can tell a story and become part of his mental map of the world, encouraging Pathologic 3: Quarantine players to pay attention to everything in the environment.</p>
