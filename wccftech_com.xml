			<p>The Lonesome Guild is a colorful action RPG where you play as a Ghost trying to bring six animal misfits together to try and save the world from a corrupting mist, and it just got a new gameplay trailer as part of the <a href="https://www.actugaming.net/ag-french-direct/?mc_cid=0f1b47ab9d&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6">AG French Direct 2025</a> event.</p>
<p>While the animals you bring together start off as lonely, they don't end up that way as you build relationships with them and work to recover the memories you lost from your life, now that you're squarely in the afterlife as a ghost.</p>
<p>Fittingly, The Lonesome Guild is all about "<em>fighting</em> <em>loneliness</em>," and the trailer showcases how you and your animal companions work together to use the power of the new friendships you're forging to fight against the large robotic contraptions you'll face on your journey through Etere.</p>

<p>If anything about The Lonesome Guild seems like it would be your kind of game, you can test that theory by playing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/">demo</a> that publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Don't Nod</a> and developer Tiny Bull Studios just released. Though the full game will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, the demo is only available on PC for now. It's also currently set to arrive on all platforms sometime in Fall 2025, but there's no specific release date as of yet.</p>

			<p>Today, CD Projekt RED has <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2025-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> its Q1 2025 financial report and revealed updates on its games, both those already out (for sales) and those on the way (for development news), such as Cyberpunk 2.</p>
<p>The sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, previously known as Project Orion, has officially entered the pre-production phase at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston-based North American office</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent expansion</a> to Cyberpunk 2077, Phantom Liberty, has sold over 10 million units since its debut in September 2023. As for the studio's other big franchise, The Witcher, the third and most successful entry in the franchise has now surpassed 60 million units sold just as the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated its tenth anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>Presenting the successful quarterly results, CD Projekt RED Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said:</p>
<p><em>On 5 June Cyberpunk Ultimate Edition will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, marking the global launch of the console itself. The game takes full advantage of the console’s new features – weapons can now be aimed gyroscopically, and touchscreen interaction is supported. For the first time ever one of our games is a launch title for a brand-new console system – which we regard as a great honor, as well as further proof of the power of our brand and our partners’ trust in us.</em></p>
<p><em>On the subject of Night City – the Phantom Liberty expansion has reached another sales milestone, having been purchased by 10 million gamers. This is an excellent result, given that only 20 months have passed since its release, and it confirms sustained interest in the Cyberpunk universe on the part of the gaming community. Given these developments, it fills me with even greater satisfaction to announce another important stage in our work on the next big game in this franchise. Several weeks ago, Cyberpunk 2 – previously referred to as Project Orion – wrapped up its conceptual phase and entered preproduction. Congratulations to the entire team!</em></p>
<p><em>Moving on to our other franchise – on 19 May we celebrated a major anniversary, with 10 years having passed since the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game brought thrilling adventures and emotions to millions of games worldwide, and earned us hundreds of awards, along with global recognition. We are proud to announce that since its launch The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a firm position among the best-selling video games in history. It’s also worth mentioning that our aggregate revenues from sales of The Witcher 3 – along with its expansions – have reached 2 billion 400 million PLN over the past decade. The success and enduring popularity of The Witcher 3 fill us with even greater motivation as we work on Ciri’s new adventures in the upcoming The Witcher 4.</em></p>
<p><em>Regarding financials, in the first three months of the year our consolidated sales revenues topped 226 million PLN. This is mainly due to continuing strong sales of Cyberpunk and its Phantom Liberty expansion. The Group’s net Q1 profit reached 86 million PLN.</em></p>
<p>As usual, CD Projekt RED also provided an update on its workforce. The total number of employees grew in the last quarter from 707 to 730, with 422 developers working on The Witcher 4 (+11), 96 developers on Cyberpunk 2 (+12), 48 developers on the multiplayer spin-off Project Sirius (-1), 19 developers on the new IP Project Hadar (+2), 131 developers on 'shared services' (+7), and 14 on other projects (-8).</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 entered pre-production in May 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduated to full production</a> a few months ago. Given this timescale, we can estimate that Cyberpunk 2 could enter full production somewhere around late 2027.</p>
<p>In other recent news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature Night City as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Chicago gone wrong'</a>, according to setting creator Mike Pondsmith.</p>
