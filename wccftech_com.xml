			<p>The new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces significant performance improvements on PlayStation 5 Pro by enabling 120 Hz VRR across all of the game's display modes.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These performance improvements are showcased in a new comparison video shared by&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RajmanGamingHD/videos" target="_blank">RajmanGaming HD,</a>&nbsp;which compares the game running with and without VRR enabled, using all of the game's display modes: Ray Tracing Pro, Balanced Ray Tracing Pro, Ray Tracing, Performance, Balanced, and Quality.</span> The comparison makes it clear how a significant amount of performance is left on the table on the PlayStation 5 Pro with the frame rate capped, as framerates are higher across all display modes with VRR and uncapped framerate.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Display Mode</th><th>VRR OFF / Capped Framerate</th><th>VRR ON / Uncapped Framerate</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing Pro</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>60 FPS</td><td>Up to 95 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>Up to 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quality</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

</p></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yotei also supports 120 Hz VRR on base PlayStation 5 with the new patch, but no performance comparison has been conducted to date, so it's not yet known how much performance was untapped with capped framerates on the system.</p>

<p>Besides introducing 120 Hz VRR support and the new Balanced display modes, the new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces a lot of new features that enhance the experience considerably, such as the ability to auto-loot items, an option to turn off fall damage, new Photo Mode features, a New Game+ mode, replayable endgame content, balance changes, and more.

<p>Ghost of Yotei, the sequel to the popular Ghost of Tsushima, launched last month on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Alessio Palumbo's review.</a></p>

			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing fixes for a couple of specific issues while improving the system's stability.</p>



<p>The 21.0.1 update, which is also live for the original Nintendo Switch, addresses an issue that caused Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 to occur when attempting a system transfer from a Switch system to a Switch 2 system.</p>



<p>The new Nintendo Switch 2 system update also addresses an issue that prevented Bluetooth devices from connecting to the console after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode. This was a particularly annoying issue that forced the user to reboot the system, so this fix is particularly welcome.</p>



<p>Being a minor update, these seem to be the only changes introduced by the 21.0.1 update. You can find the official update notes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-update-version-21-0-1-released-november-24-2025">Switch 2 Update Version 21.0.1 (Released November 24, 2025)</h2>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 would repeatedly occur on a Nintendo Switch when attempting a system transfer using local communication from a Nintendo Switch system to a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes, after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode, wireless controllers or Bluetooth audio devices were unable to connect.</li>



<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the new Nintendo Switch 2 update is a minor update, some undocumented changes may have been introduced to the system. At the time of writing, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome">dedicated dataminer Oatmeal Dome</a> has yet to report any findings; however, we will update the post as soon as new information about the update is discovered.</p>



<p>The latest major Nintendo Switch 2 system update was update 21.0.0, which launched earlier this month. The update introduced changes to the HOME menu to indicate whether the software shown is a physical or digital release, the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the <em>"Use Online License" </em>setting is turned off, and more. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/43314">More information can be found on the Nintendo Support website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-would-like-shadowdrop-more-games-after-owning-the-day-with-oblivion-remastered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-would-like-to-shadowdrop-more-games-after-%E2%80%98owning-the-day%E2%80%99-with-oblivion-remastered.1363804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Bethesda Game Studios briefly captured the interest of many gamers with the mystery surrounding the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Rumors had swirled for months about it, but they did not confirm anything until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement and immediate release of Oblivion Remastered on April 22, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It was a veritable 'shadowdrop', an unusual marketing strategy where the developer and publisher do not market their product in advance but instead focus entirely on maximizing the surprise effect. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> during the recent Golden Joystick Awards, Bethesda Game Studios Director Tom Mustaine, who was in charge of the Oblivion remaster project as Director of External Projects (Virtuos handled the game's Unreal Engine 5 port), mentioned the previous shadowdrop of Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush as a successful test run and suggested the studio would like to do more.</p>



<p><em>We had a real successful shadowdrop with Hi-Fi Rush through Xbox and through Bethesda. Todd Howard, the boss man, he's wanted to shadowdrop things for a long time because it's so great to be able to say, 'Here's the thing, get it today.' It's very valuable.</em></p>



<p><em>We all have short attention spans now. There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy… I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the penchant of Bethesda Game Studios boss Todd Howard for shadowdrops is well known. Just recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he'd love for the studio's next highly anticipated game, The Elder Scrolls VI, to 'just appear' eventually once it is ready to ship to fans.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely Microsoft would agree to let them do this to such a massively anticipated title, sequel to one of the best-selling games of all time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Going with a more traditional marketing campaign would be the safest route, although perhaps a middle ground could be a Fallout 4-style reveal at E3 (now Summer Game Fest) and subsequent release in November. </p>



<p>A game that could be shadowdropped by Bethesda, similar to Oblivion Remastered, is the Fallout 3 remaster. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's in development alongside a remaster of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>
