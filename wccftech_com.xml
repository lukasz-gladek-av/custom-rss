			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a trailer showcasing the characters from the Camarilla Court in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. If you've been wanting to get a closer glimpse into the characters from the game, this trailer shows you what you can expect from how the Kindred interact with players and how they move around the streets of Seattle. The characters all have drastically different personalities, with Benny being a stern character with a potty mouth. Tolly is a unique character with a big personality; Safia is forgetful and quaint, while Lou is demanding and ever-present.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - ‘A Betting Man’ Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2cXtEoGx7E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a short trailer just over a minute, the characters all get a brief showcase so you can see them in action, whether it be in combat or conversation with the characters mentioned. This trailer ties in nicely with Dev Diary 15, which was released in August, and discusses the Dialogue Choice system and how you will be able to interact with the different characters in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We have already covered</a> this dev diary,&nbsp;</span>and we trimmed it down into bite-size pieces for you to read through.</span> Although the trailer showcases the characters ever so slightly, it doesn't provide much information about them other than their main traits and tiny glimpses into their interactions with others.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialogue choice system</a> that The Chinese Room have put in place, it gives you many different options on how you can interact with the characters in front of you and it's mentioned in the dev diary that they wanted to make sure that the choices didn't have any hidden dialogue or choices that may screw over your character unintentionally due to context not being added. This is something that can happen easily in story-based games, as sometimes prompts don't give the entire conversation, or the characters react in a way that seems totally unexpected.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as we get closer to the release date of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, we will get to see more of the Camarilla Court. Additionally, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-camarilla-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary 16</a> was about the Camarilla Court and provided some additional context which can help you read between the lines from the short trailer that was provided today. The dev diary gives quotes from each of the characters, as well as an in-depth description of who they are and what role they play within the court.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're looking to get stuck in with the scary season but aren't sure what games to play for <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Halloween</a>, this list compiles some of the best horror games that you can pick up. The list will include both indie games and triple-A for those who prefer a smaller-scale experience. Hold on to your hats, as this list features some of the best scares you can get on the market right now.</p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Whether you play the original Silent Hill 2 or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> that was recently released, you're in for a good time. The Remake did a great job of keeping it authentic and much like the original, but added in some extra scares and puzzles to keep the game fresh. For the best experience, you'll want to play this game with headphones, as Bloober Team knocked the sound design out of the park. From Mary's little gasps to the possible chance of hearing whispering from the original, you're not going to want to miss out on all the easter eggs they've included in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<h2>Outlast</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/Outlast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlast</a> is one of the classic horror games that most people play or try to play when diving into the horror genre. If you haven't played it already, you're missing out. Having to explore an abandoned asylum where the lights don't seem to work very often adds to the atmosphere. Combine that with having to use your video camera to be able to navigate and see your surroundings; it can get pretty intense.</p>
<p>Be warned, there is a ton of nudity and a lot of gore, so it may not be the horror game for you if you're the squeamish type.</p>
<h2>Crow Country</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> was released earlier this year and took the gaming world by storm. This was the perfect game to bridge the gap while waiting for the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as it takes place in a theme park, much like some of Silent Hill 3. It also features amazing PS1-style graphics, which are perfect for those who are looking for a hit of nostalgia in their horror. The style of the game is great for those who want to feel on edge and have a little bit of fear running through their veins but don't want to experience the realistic jumpscares that are found in more modernized horror games.</p>
<h2>Phasmophobia</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for an all-around comedic time with some friends, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phasmophobia</a> is the way to go. Of course, just because you're with friends doesn't at all mean you're safe, and you may find yourself getting jumpscared a fair few times. The game is quite goofy and is a lot of silly fun, but sometimes the silence is so thick it puts you on edge, especially if you're hunting ghosts by yourself. Make sure not to get killed by the ghost, and everything will turn out fine. Luckily, Phasmophobia just came out on console, so you can now play with your friends on PlayStation and Xbox if you're on PC!</p>
<h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's pretty recommended to play the original Alan Wake games before jumping into <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, but you're in for a wild ride when you do get around to it. Not only are the graphics absolutely stunning, but there are more scares than ever. If you're a fan of survival horror, Alan Wake 2 is a great game to get stuck into. On top of that, it's perfect for those who love a twisty story, as there is certainly plenty of that.</p>
<p>The Lake House DLC just came out for Alan Wake 2 as well, so it's a perfect time to get stuck into the game with all of the DLC available. It will also get you excited for the upcoming title, Control 2. You can't go wrong with any of the Remedy Entertainment games, but Alan Wake 2 is certainly one you don't want to miss out on.</p>
<h2>Dead by Daylight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is another perfect game to play with friends or family. Whether you're the killer and you're hunting them down, or you choose to survive along with your friends (or strangers), there's plenty of fun to be had. You're likely to spend the entire time on edge while trying to fix generators, only for the adrenaline to really get pumping if you miss a skill check on the generator.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are many iconic killers that you can find yourself running away from, including the beloved Xenomorph, Pyramid Head, and even Michael Myers. Dead by Daylight is highly accessible, too, as it's on every platform and is cross-play, allowing you to play with your friends who may be on a console while you're on PC.</p>
<h2>Alien: Isolation</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Isolation</a> is one of the most iconic horror games from modern-day gaming. First released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the graphics were really ahead of its time. Even now, the game looks absolutely phenomenal, and you will be on edge as you explore the ship. There are plenty of moments for a false sense of security, and the Xenomorphs aren't the only thing you have to worry about on the ship with you.</p>
<h2>Still Wakes The Deep</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes The Deep</a> is one of the more recent horror games to be released, and it certainly lived up to its name this year. If you're looking for a Halloween horror, this stunning and horrifying game is perfect for you. Taking place on an oil rig, you have to try and survive while dealing with the otherworldly creature to try and save yourself and your crew mates from certain death. If you have a fear of the ocean or deep sea creatures, you may want to avoid this one.</p>
<h2>Mouthwashing</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mouthwashing</a> is a recent release and is the perfect game to play for Halloween if you're looking for a game that is tense and confusing and has that PS1 surrealist vibe to it. It will leave you on edge and also feeling very confused about what's going on as you slowly uncover the story of the crewmates on the spaceship named Tulpar. The crew mates descend into madness, and you aren't far behind.</p>
<h2>Visage</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for a game that has a P.T. feel to it,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594330/Visage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Visage</a> is the perfect game. Not only are there episodic stories for you to work through, but there are also puzzles and great sound design that will torment you long after you've completed the game. Visage is quite jumpscare-heavy at times and tackles a lot of difficult themes, but it is absolutely worth playing if you've got the time this Halloween.</p>
<h2>Little Nightmares</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/424840/Little_Nightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares</a> is the perfect horror game for those who are a bit sensitive to jumpscares and other elements you'd typically find in horror. It's scary without their heavy jumpscares and relies on great character design, storytelling, and puzzle-solving to keep you on edge. Little Nightmares also has some great DLC to accompany it, as well as a sequel if you find that you have enjoyed what's on offer from this title.</p>
<h2>Resident Evil 7</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While a lot of the Resident Evil games focus on killing zombies and trying to fight for your survival against hordes of enemies and the like, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 7</a> goes down a more stereotypical horror route. You have to explore the grungy southern farmhouse and uncover a ton of horrifying secrets. The family you meet are not what they seem, and they are bound to have you on edge. If you find yourself enjoying Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village ties in nicely to 7 to finish the story.</p>
<p>That concludes our list of horror games to play for Halloween. What will you be playing this Halloween?</p>
