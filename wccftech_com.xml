			<p>Ports of Xbox games for Nintendo Switch 2 are currently in the works, and their reveal should be imminent, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>The Verge's Tom Warren confirmed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory">recent report</a> focused on the announcement of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced, which is launching on PlayStation 5 this Summer, that Microsoft is also working on some Xbox ports for Nintendo Switch 2, which he expects will be revealed soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate also said the same on X, so we should probably expect to see the announcement of the first few ports in the coming weeks during the "non-E3" season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next up: Xbox games coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925234110588473837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft already having released ports of Xbox games on the original Nintendo Switch, such as Sea of Thieves and Grounded, it's not surprising to learn that more games will be coming to the next-generation system, which promises to be extremely successful at launch. As for which Xbox games could hit the Nintendo Switch 2, no one can say at the moment, but it's been previously rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> will launch on the system. Seeing the latter run on Nintendo Switch 2 would be quite interesting from a technical standpoint, as the game can be quite demanding, although if Asobo Studio managed to get the game running on Xbox Series S, it will definitely be possible to scale the game to the Switch 2 hardware capabilities, which may be better than anticipated, judging from how <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the system.</a></p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> another episode of its Ask the Developer Series dedicated to upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games, and this time it's all about Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This could very well be the 'killer application' of the new console. Its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-8-deluxe-best-kart-racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, launched shortly after the launch of the original Switch and was immediately a smashing success. The game has sold over 65 million units to date, becoming one of the best-selling premium titles of all time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kosuke Yabuki (Producer of the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department) revealed in this interview that prototyping on Mario Kart World started even before the predecessor launched on the Switch, while full development began later in 2017.</p>
<p><em>We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017. It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.</em></p>
<p>It's an exceedingly long time to make a game by Nintendo's standards. However, the team has significant challenges to overcome, such as doubling the amount of players in a race from 12 to 24 while adding an open world. Everything became much more feasible once the decision was made to move the project to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kenta Sato (Programming Director):</strong> When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return. We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kosuke Yabuki:</strong> We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we'd decided to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</a>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.</em></p>
<p>Our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out Mario Kart World</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 press hands-on event and came away favorably impressed:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em></p>

			<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-full-launch-scheduled-for-may-21-devs-want-to-bring-the-entirety-of-westeros-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, Netmarble has released Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and Windows Launcher) and mobile devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>) across the world with the exception of Asia, where the game will debut later in 2025. The action/adventure roleplaying game (powered by Unreal Engine 5) had previously debuted in early access exclusively on PC. Cross-play is enabled between PC and mobile, by the way, once you've linked the accounts.</p>
<p>The launch update added the new Stormlands region, the one ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Players will find new story missions and side content, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferocious Beast</li>
<li>Bandit Camps</li>
<li>Echoes of the Past</li>
<li>Historic Sites</li>
<li>Occupied Sites</li>
<li>Gods Haven</li>
</ul>
<p>The level cap was raised from 40 to 45. Four new Artifacts (one Legendary, one Epic, and two Uncommon) have been added. New Achievements have been added for performing feats in the Stormlands as well as defeating the Unicorn and Drogon. Moreover, an emote system was added to Game of Thrones: Kingsroad and can now be accessed by selecting the emotes icon in the lower right corner of the chat window.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uNd9WH5QmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the official launch, Netmarble will gift players a random reward once per day through June 5. Potential rewards include x80 Golden Dragon, x1 Ruin Runner, x2,000 Copper, x10 Iron Ore, x1 Artifact Expedition Requisition, x3 Silver Ore, and x1 Enraging Draught Bundle. To claim the rewards, players must simply visit the Web Shop daily.</p>
<p>Over time, the developer has expressed the desire to add all the remaining regions to eventually bring all of Westeros to life. Of course, being a live service game at its core, it will largely depend on the game's success. If Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is popular enough, it may happen over time; otherwise, it could be shut down way before that happens.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment.1195950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embracer Group announced a rebranding to Fellowship Entertainment.&nbsp;<span>This is a clear nod to The Lord of the Rings IP, whose rights Embracer&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchased</a> around two years ago&nbsp;</span>for a relatively low sum ($395 million). Following the acquisition, COO Matthew Karch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the group's priority should be turning The Lord of the Rings into one of gaming's biggest franchises. Karch is no longer with Embracer (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split with Saber Interactive a while ago</a>), but the sentiment appears to have remained the same, given the brand name's choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Tolkien's beloved fantasy universe is just one of many big franchises owned by Fellowship Entertainment, such as Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Darksiders, Remnant, and Tomb Raider. The new company will house over 6K employees spread across 50 companies or so.</p>
<p>The other big news announced today is that Coffee Stain Group (Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Deep Rock Galactic) is being spun off into a separately listed company. Lars Wingefors, co-founder and Group CEO of Embracer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Coffee Stain Group has incredible talent, IPs and communities. To date, it has been a true recipe for success. I am confident in Anton's strategy and leadership and see a clear long-term opportunity in attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents.</em></p>
<p>Anton Westbergh, co-founder and Group CEO of Coffee Stain, added:</p>
<p><em>We’re really proud of everything we’ve built as part of Embracer, and grateful for the support and trust we’ve received over the years. Now, as we take the step to become a separately listed company, it feels both exciting and, honestly, a little bit scary—but in a good way.</em></p>
<p><em>The games industry is more competitive than ever, but also more rewarding if you do things right, and we believe this move gives us the clarity and control to navigate the landscape better on our own terms. We can now focus even more on what we do best—supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain.</em></p>
<p>The Embracer name will live on, albeit stained after countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a>, only as the privately held holding company of Fellowship Entertainment, Coffee Stain Group, and Asmodee Group (which had been spun off earlier this year). Lars Wingefors, as the main shareholder, will remain in control.</p>
<p>The company also provided an overview of its announced release schedule. In fiscal year 2025/2026, the following titles will be launched:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Eden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic 1 Remake</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fellowship</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wreckreation</a></li>
<li>The next SpongeBob SquarePants game</li>
<li>NORSE: Oath of Blood</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killing Floor 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Embracer said a triple-A game previously scheduled for 2025/2026 is likely to be moved to 2026/2027. The company expects <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar sales to Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> for this title. They may be referring to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-metro-game-will-be-much-darker-due-to-the-war-says-4a-games-will-be-ready-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Metro game</a>, though there's no way to know for sure.</p>
