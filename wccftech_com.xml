			<p>Almost two years ago, at the time of writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/">EA and Cliffhanger Games confirmed</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-open-world-game-rumor-ea-studio-shadow-of-morder-vets/">rumors</a> of a new Black Panther game coming from EA were true, and that the team at Cliffhanger was working on a new single-player, third-person action game with Black Panther as the main character.</p>
<p>Today, a new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN</a> revealed that EA has <strong>canceled</strong> its Black Panther game and shut down the studio working on it, Cliffhanger Games. It's the latest batch of layoffs from Electronic Arts after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off 300-400 developers last month</a> and canceled an incubation project at Respawn. It also recently announced that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">sunsetting its remote work policies</a> and moving to push employees back to working in the office.</p>
<p>According to the report, the layoffs extend to members of EA's mobile and central teams, but the company would not share exactly how many developers were impacted. In an email from Laura Miele, EA Entertainment president, she reportedly called the decision, and the other recent layoffs that EA has suffered, "<em>hard</em>" choices, but that they are choices being made to "<em>sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.</em>"</p>
<p>Miele also wrote that the company is doing "<em>everything we can to support them, including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles</em>." She also continues to say that moving forward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">EA's Entertainment division</a> will focus on: The Sims, Skate, Battlefield, and Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Respawn will still work on the upcoming third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-will-be-written-by-squirrel-girl-writer-ryan-north/">Iron Man game from Motive Studio</a> is still happening, though with this cancellation, it's worth not putting too much stock in Miele's reassurances about the Iron Man game, especially when considering what EA's chief executive officer, Andrew Wilson, said last year about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA moving away from games based on licensed IP</a>.</p>
<p>It's upsetting to see more developers lose their jobs, and an additional sad point with Cliffhanger Games's closure is that it's the latest part of the tragedy of Monolith Studios. Cliffhanger was founded by former Monolith developers who worked on the Shadow of Mordor games, and helped develop the nemesis system that players still rave about today. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith is gone</a>, and the studio founded by Monolith veterans is also gone.</p>

			<p>The Lonesome Guild is a colorful action RPG where you play as a Ghost trying to bring six animal misfits together to try and save the world from a corrupting mist, and it just got a new gameplay trailer as part of the <a href="https://www.actugaming.net/ag-french-direct/?mc_cid=0f1b47ab9d&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6">AG French Direct 2025</a> event.</p>
<p>While the animals you bring together start off as lonely, they don't end up that way as you build relationships with them and work to recover the memories you lost from your life, now that you're squarely in the afterlife as a ghost.</p>
<p>Fittingly, The Lonesome Guild is all about "<em>fighting</em> <em>loneliness</em>," and the trailer showcases how you and your animal companions work together to use the power of the new friendships you're forging to fight against the large robotic contraptions you'll face on your journey through Etere.</p>

<p>If anything about The Lonesome Guild seems like it would be your kind of game, you can test that theory by playing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/">demo</a> that publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Don't Nod</a> and developer Tiny Bull Studios just released. Though the full game will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, the demo is only available on PC for now. It's also currently set to arrive on all platforms sometime in Fall 2025, but there's no specific release date as of yet.</p>
