			<p>Exactly two weeks ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that sources inside <strong>Microsoft</strong> pointed to an early plan to potentially add more third-party services to <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, in a bid to make it more appealing. After the <strong>shocking price increase to</strong> <strong>$30</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went live on October 1, 2025</a>, many Xbox gamers feel it isn't worth it anymore, even with the inclusion of <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong>, hence why Microsoft might be looking to add value.</p>



<p>Interestingly, a new rumor comes from WindowsCentral's Jez Corden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ROeswcSpCiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a YouTube livestream</a>, he mentioned Warren's report while adding that he heard Microsoft is also considering the addition of first-party services, such as the <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Minecraft Realms</strong>, <strong>Fallout 1st</strong>, and <strong>Elder Scrolls Online Plus</strong> subscriptions.</p>



<p><em>I think there is an opportunity to make Game Pass Ultimate worth the money. There was a report recently from Tom Warren in his newsletter on The Verge; he said something along the lines of, Microsoft's looking at ways to add even more value to Game Pass. I think making it like there are more reasons to subscribe at $30 is probably a race against time for them right now, where they're like, "We need to make this work and make people feel like it's worthwhile". </em></p>



<p><em><strong>One thing I did hear, and I don't know if this would ever happen, but one thing I did hear</strong> - this is something I get asked a lot - <strong>is they were exploring putting the World of Warcraft and some of the other subscriptions they got, like Fallout 1st, Minecraft Realms...They were exploring putting that in Game Pass Ultimate</strong>. Now, if they did that, if they put World of Warcraft, Minecraft Realms, Fallout 1st, and the Elder Scrolls [Online Plus] subscription, if they put all that into Game Pass Ultimate, then oh boy, does it become worth it then for me at $30. </em></p>



<p>Then, answering a viewer's question on the same topic, he added:</p>



<p><em>I kind of just addressed that. It does seem like they're going to eventually integrate some of the subscription into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but we'll see if it actually happens.</em></p>



<p>Using the subscriptions of first-party companies to add value to Game Pass Ultimate seems like a smart move, although Microsoft will definitely look carefully into the economics to see if it's feasible. Almost certainly, it wouldn't be possible to bundle all those into Game Pass Ultimate without touching up the individual services. Still, here's what each of them costs and offers right now:</p>

			<p>Website CzechCrunch has <a href="https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> creator <strong>Daniel Vávra</strong>, who co-founded <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> and served as the Game Director and Lead Writer for the franchise's two <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released installments</a>, will focus on bringing the IP to cinema or television rather than working on a third entry.</p>



<p>The news was shared by Warhorse CEO <strong>Martin Frývaldský</strong>, who explained:</p>



<p><em>Dan has a new role. That's the creation of the Kingdom Come movie. We have been moving the Kingdom Come brand away from video games for some time now. So far, we have been in comics, concerts, and tourism, but the film has attracted us the most. That is why Dan and I are working on getting it onto the screen or the big screen. There is also a draft script. We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway. We don't just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be. </em></p>



<p>However, Frývaldský also clarified that this isn't a breakup with Warhorse for Vávra:</p>



<p><em>I'm sure people will wonder if this is some kind of breakup with Warhorse. No, on the contrary, Dan himself wanted to move on. He made three games that were a global success, he has been wanting to try something different for a long time. Getting Kingdom Come to the screen or the screen in the next few years is another milestone that we want to achieve, and that is Dan's new role. You won't see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense, he is still part of Warhorse.</em></p>



<p><em>We would have to be blind if we didn't realize how much our brand has grown. In fact, Dan Vávra's new position could be called transmedia director. In any case, we see the film as a complement to our game creation, which can be extremely successful in its own right.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, Frývaldský even revealed that Warhorse <strong>had already been approached about adapting Kingdom Come: Deliverance after the first game</strong>. However, the arrival of COVID meant discussions died down for a few years. Now, following the amazing success of the new game (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over five million units sold</a></strong>), the studio is more interested than ever in pursuing this venue.</p>



<p>It would be just the latest in an ever-growing list of game adaptations for cinema or TV. Historically, they haven't fared well, but that is slowly changing with the likes of <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, <strong>Super Mario</strong>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, and <strong>Sonic</strong>, to name a few.</p>



<p>As for Daniel Vávra, we're sure that even in his new position, he'll continue to make controversial comments on social media, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when he criticized <strong>Obsidian</strong> for not making an innovative game since <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong></a>. </p>
