			<p>VOID Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles sometime this coming summer 2025, the studio announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ready or Not puts you in the boots of modern-day SWAT teams sent into hostile situations where you are trying not to pull the trigger as often as possible, and take culprits alive by following proper rules of engagement. Running in with your guns blazing is a fast track to mission failure, which is where the tactical side of Ready or Not's gameplay comes in.</p>
<p>First released in Early Access in December 2021, Ready or Not launched its full 1.0 version two years later in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">December 2023</a>. Now, a little more than a year after that launch, it is nearly ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Ready or Not was shown during the Galaxies Showcase 2025 event, which you can see below.</p>

<p>VOID Interactive has been on a long journey with Ready or Not, first announcing the game back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a>. It's also had its fair share of issues along the way, like being temporarily removed from Steam due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-was-temporarily-removed-from-steam-due-to-trademark-infringement/">trademark infringement</a> and the controversy surrounding a level in the game depicting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-top-selling-game-ready-or-not-has-its-devs-commenting-on-planned-school-shooting-level/">bomb threat at a school</a>, which prompted a <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1474203773878816778">statement</a> from the development team.</p>
<p>Neither issue has stopped Ready or Not from achieving a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam across 180,000+ user reviews. It'll be interesting to see how console players take to it, and anyone interested can rush to their device to wishlist the game now.</p>
