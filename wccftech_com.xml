			<p>A new media blast for Ninja Gaiden 4 went out yesterday, and YouTuber GamersPrey has uploaded a full hour of new gameplay with absolutely no commentary attached. It's a feast for the eyes of all those fans who feared the franchise was dead. They had every right to believe so, given that the previous entry, Ninja Gaiden 3, launched in 2012 and received middling reviews to boot.</p>



<p>Now, the action series is coming back, and it is doing so with a sort of 'dream collaboration' between historic developer Team Ninja and fellow Japanese developer PlatinumGames, who is also known for acclaimed action titles like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and the Bayonetta franchise. </p>



<p>Speaking about this partnership in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryp7yKdq5Bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Iron Lords Podcast</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama from Team Ninja explained:</p>



<p><em>Well, for Team Ninja, Ninja Gaiden is a very important IP and title, so we have always wanted to create a new Ninja Gaiden game. Initially, the presidents of our company, Mr. Ono from Team Ninja, and Mr. Inaba from PlatinumGames, who are actually of the same generation and have had ongoing exchanges, discussed whether the two companies could collaborate on something new. Given PlatinumGames’ excellent track record with action games like Nier and Bayonetta, which we respect greatly, we thought it would be a great challenge to work together on a new Ninja Gaiden title. Furthermore, as you mentioned, with support from Phil Spencer at Xbox, the project was able to come together with a three-way collaboration</em>.</p>

			<p>Sony executives shared <span>many details on PlayStation strategies during the <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_02_en/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company's Q1 2025 investors call Q&amp;A</a>. For example, we&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/" target="_blank">received confirmation</a>&nbsp;that there will be a shift from a hardware-centric business model to a platform business model focused on engagement&nbsp;</span>beyond PlayStation consoles.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">reported</a> earlier from the Q&amp;A that Bungie's Marathon is expected to launch by March 2026. Bungie is set to lose most of its independence as it slowly gets absorbed into PlayStation Studios, despite initial statements at the time of the acquisition. The thorn subject of PlayStation live service games was touched repeatedly during the Q&amp;A, and Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao admitted that the plan (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally targeted 10 live service games released by March 2026</a>) hasn't gone as smoothly as they would have liked. At the same time, she pointed out that it's not all doom and gloom, and those lessons will be helpful for future projects.</p>



<p><em>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord was canceled</a>, and this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon was postponed</a>, so somewhat negative news has been coming out. But if you look at the we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. Now, we have&nbsp;Helldivers 2, MLB The Show and&nbsp;Gran Turismo 7, and&nbsp;Bungie's&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;2, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner. For Q1 2025, live service ratio was about 40%. For the full year, it's a little less, probably between 20 to 30%. So, in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change. Of course, we recognize that there are still issues, many issues, so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there's less waste and it's more smooth.</em></p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation success in the live service segment, but it didn't even come from a first-party studio. That alone is telling in how much Sony still has to learn to be successful in this elusive category of gaming. Marathon's fate will no doubt mark a pivotal moment - will it soar like Helldivers 2 or flounder right away like Concord? We'll know more in a few months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Executive Confirms That PlayStation Is Moving Away from the Hardware Business Toward a Platform Business]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-executive-confirms-that-playstation-is-moving-away-from-the-hardware-business-toward-a-platform-business.1265379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Sony announced the quarterly financial results for Q1 2025, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the PlayStation 5 console had shipped 80.3 million units as of the end of June. The whole Game and Network Services (G&amp;NS) segment registered an 8% year-on-year increase in sales of 936.5 billion yen ($6.35 billion), primarily due to the rise in third-party software sales, which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>



<p>As a consequence of the recent strong user engagement trend, Sony has upwardly revised their fiscal year 2025 forecast for sales slightly from last time to 4 trillion 320 billion yen ($29.31 billion), as well as the forecast for operating income by 4% to 500 billion yen ($3.39 billion). Year-on-year, user engagement continued to increase, with the number of monthly active users (MAUs) across PlayStation increasing by 6% in June compared to the same month last year, reaching 123 million accounts. Total playtime for the quarter also increased by 6% year-on-year.</p>



<p>Sony also said that operating income increased approximately 2.3x year-on-year to 148 billion yen ($1 billion), a new quarterly record high for the segment. This was primarily due to the impact of the increased sales of third-party software and an increase in network services revenue.</p>



<p>But arguably the most interesting tidbit, at least for gamers, came from the subsequent Q&amp;A with investors, where Sadahiko Hayakawa, Senior Vice President in charge of Finance and IR at Sony, said:</p>



<p><em>In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement.</em></p>



<p>The Q&amp;A is available <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_01_ja/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and the translation was <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953491713693217147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X</a> along with the news by Tokyo-based user Genki_JPN, who often reports on Japanese news. This aligns with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-appears-preparing-port-more-playstation-exclusives/">recently discovered job listing</a> for a Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, which hinted that Sony would bring even more games not only to PC but also to Xbox and Nintendo platforms, too, in an effort to increase PlayStation users (those elusive monthly active users, or MAUs).</p>



<p>So far, it was believed that it might be limited to live service games such as Helldivers 2, but that caveat was seemingly not specified this time. If such a business shift were to be confirmed, it would mean that Nintendo alone will keep making first-party games for its own consoles only, essentially heralding the end of the console wars.</p>
