			<p>Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, and fully realizing Hideki Kamiya's vision for the game wouldn't have been possible without it.</p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kami-2-is-being-made-in-re-engine-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata confirmed the long-awaited new entry in the series will indeed use the engine that has powered all major CAPCOM games since Resident Evil 7.&nbsp;The studio's experience with the engine will aid Clovers, who has no experience with it, in the development of the game.</p>
<p>As for why Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, CAPCOM producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that the engine was picked because, without it, they wouldn't have been able to realize Hideki Kamiya's artistic vision for the game. The game's director himself added that the engine is famous for <em>"showing the best of the games that they have"</em> and that it is very good <em>"expressively"</em>, so it definitely sounds like the game is going to be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The announcement of Okami 2 was among the biggest surprises revealed during last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">The Game Awards show</a>. The only teaser shown to date essentially confirmed that Amaterasu will come back in the new game and that it will feature an updated version of the original's unique visual style. Better yet, as already mentioned, it will be directed by Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original as well as the creator of some of the best action game series ever made, such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>Okami 2 is currently in development for yet to be confirmed platforms. Its release date has yet to be announced as well, so it may be a while until we see how the RE Engine has made it possible for Kamiya-san's vision to realize his vision.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer mentioned Rare's Everwild game in an appearance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q20AFtPXKSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the 250th episode of the Xbox Era podcast</a>. During the 36-minute-long conversation, the executive named it among his most anticipated games (among those that have been announced) alongside State of Decay 3 and the next project from Double Fine.</p>
<p><em>I'll go back to what I said earlier. State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love, back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine is doing and how Tim (Schafer) kind of solicits feedback from the team [is great]. And the other one I'll say, because I was recently out at Rare, it's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making.</em></p>
<p><em>It has been a while. We've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing, which is good, and still have a portfolio like we have, which is a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time. Next week, I'm gonna be up in Vancouver with The Coalition.</em></p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> over five years ago, before COVID-19, during the X019 event. Over the years, though, it became clear that Rare didn't really have a clear picture of what they were doing yet. Development was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly rebooted</a> in 2021 due to the game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'a real mess'</a>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Windows Central's Jez Corden - who's always well-informed on what's going internally at Xbox Game Studios - <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game had finally nailed the gameplay loop. The new statement from Spencer confirms this is true, so people can start looking forward to a reveal in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the British studio had already kind of <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-christmas-card-has-rare-fans-hyped-about-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> its fans with a nice Everwild themed Christmas card.</p>
<p>At any rate, the game may be shown again during the upcoming June Showcase, but don't expect it to launch this year. Microsoft already has a big lineup for 2025: following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> (out tomorrow, although Premium Edition owners can already play it), Compulsion Games is set to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> next month, then id Software will follow with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> in May, and Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposedly in the final quarter of the year</a>. That's not even counting Ninja Gaiden 4 (which is being published by Xbox Game Studios), the rumored launch of Gears of War: E-Day, and new stuff from Activision Blizzard, like the upcoming Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Everwild may instead be part of the 2026 lineup alongside Clockwork Revolution, Perfect Dark, and the next game from Double Fine, ensuring yet another potentially great year for Microsoft as a publisher. Indeed, it seems like all the money spent on acquisitions is finally paying off now that the developers have hit their stride as part of the Xbox family.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-rumored-to-be-announced-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared earlier this month</a>, Ubisoft confirmed during the Six Invitational eSports tournament that Rainbow Six Siege X is real. A full-fledged showcase will take place on March 13 at 10 AM PT / 7 PM CET via the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Twitch channel</a>, though folks will also be able to attend this event in person in Atlanta, Georgia. For now, the developers said Rainbow Six Siege X will include graphics and sound upgrades, deeper tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game. You can check out a brief video teaser below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4vvBU-1CCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, the live service of the regular Rainbow Six Siege goes on in the meantime. Year 10 kicks off shortly with the first season, called Operation Prep Phase. Again, just like in the leak, the season will introduce a new Operator called Rauora. Hailing from New Zealand, she joins the Attackers team and will be available at the start of the season with the new Battle Pass; two weeks later, she'll become unlockable with Renown or R6 Credits.</p>
<p>Rauora brings with her a powerful pair of primary weapons: the 417 designated sniper rifle or the M249 light machine gun. Her secondary weapon options include the GSH-18 9mm pistol or the new Reaper MK2 submachine gun. The Reaper is equipped with a red dot sight and an extended magazine, making Rauora very dangerous in close combat. Smoke grenades or breach charges round out her kit.</p>
<p>Arguably, what distinguishes her the most is the gadget called Deployable Omnilink Mesh (D.O.M.) Launcher. This is a bulletproof smart cover system that only works in doorways. When Rauora aims at a doorway, an on-screen icon indicates when she has a valid target and can fire the gadget. Once the projectile reaches the door, it attaches and deploys a bulletproof panel that extends all the way to the floor. This is unusual for Rainbow Six Siege, as there is usually room for drones to pass under barricades, but the smart cover panel can sense when a drone is nearby; it will then lift the panel slightly, allowing the drone to pass through before fully closing again.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Prep Phase Operator Gameplay Gadget &amp; Starter Tips" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vea1SlpEvkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With her bulletproof barriers, Rauora is able to block enemies' lines of sight and impede their movement, and she can use them relatively safely from a distance. But what if she and her allies want to get through? There's a rectangular trigger at the top of the panel that appears on either side of the door. The trigger will remain locked unless an Operator approaches, at which point it will unlock and open. If someone shoots the trigger, the panel door will open. If the door is open and you pull the trigger, it will close.</p>
<p>Both Attackers and Defenders can interact with the panel to open or close the barrier, but the attacking team has a few advantages. Firstly, when the panel is first deployed or has just closed, the trigger will lock out the defenders for a short time; their presence will not open it, only the Attackers' will. Second, the door moves much faster when triggered by an Attacker. These two tactical timing advantages give attackers the power to dictate the pace around the panels, hopefully catching their opponents off guard.</p>
<p>Whether you're walling off doors for cover as your team enters the building, closing off flanking routes as you advance in the field, or fortifying your defenses after the plant, Rauora's ability to act as a one-woman renovation team can have a profound effect on the flow of battle. Team her up with Ying or Fuze, and their plates can help you pack a real punch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Year 10 Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mj99yIzCQpc?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, Ubisoft warned that the plates are bulletproof but not blastproof. Or Oryx-proof. They won't knock over a Castle barricade, and they won't work properly under the influence of TubarÃ£o's Zoto Canister. Even JÃ¤ger's ADS can stop them before they get started, so be smart about how and when you use them.</p>
<p>Operation Prep Phase will be available to try next week ahead of the full launch scheduled for next month. As for Rainbow Six Siege X, there's no date yet, but the aforementioned leak said it would be released alongside the second season of Year 10.</p>
