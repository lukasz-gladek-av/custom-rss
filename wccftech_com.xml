			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4 </a>works wonders on Steam Deck, introducing significant image quality improvements in select games that make the performance hit more than worth it in most cases.</p>



<p>New comparison videos shared online by Deck Wizard compare <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> running on Steam Deck with AMD FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5. The side-by-side comparison of both games highlights how the new version of the upscaler, which has only recently unofficially become available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>, delivers significantly cleaner and sharper image quality than its predecessor, making the performance hit well worth it in most cases. While both games are best experienced at 60 FPS - especially Stellar Blade, given its action-focused gameplay—the improvements already visible at this early stage suggest that FSR 4's implementation on the handheld platform has strong potential and may only get better with further optimization.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>AMD FSR 4 is the first version of the upscaler to go the full <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-fidelityfx-super-resolution-ai-follows-nvidia-dlss-intel-xess-better-visual-fidelity/">"AI" route</a>, following NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS in using machine learning to improve image quality and performance of modern games. Initially only available for RX 9000 series GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to use the new version of the upscaler on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RDNA 3</a> and RDNA 2 through a leaked INT8 version of FSR 4's source code, which can be manually implemented using tools like <a href="https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler">OptiScaler</a>. Although with a performance hit, the upscaler still delivers significantly better image quality on this old hardware.</p>

			<p>Team Reptile, the studio behind the Jet Set Radio-inspired Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has just revealed its next game, Hyperfunk, which looks to be another fast-paced, music-infused, combo-focused rush. It'll be coming to PC and consoles when it's ready, but at the time of this writing, no release date or release window has been announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Team Reptile's <a href="https://team-reptile.com/hyperfunk-reveal/">website</a>, with a post that included a short description of the game and a teaser trailer, showing off a small snippet of gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Reptile's new game is called Hyperfunk</em>," the post reads. "<em>An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Official HYPERFUNK Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDzg_j6nCsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's clear from the trailer that Team Reptile is working to further refine what it did in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, focusing once again on fluid movement and trick-centric gameplay. It'll be interesting to see how else Hyperfunk evolves on the studio's previous work, and hopefully, we'll have a release date to look forward to soon.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/">reviewed Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> when it launched back in 2023, we wrote "<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is a game that's clearly wearing its inspiration on its sleeve. With mechanics that are pretty easy to get into and a great soundtrack to boot, fans of Jet Set Radio and 3D platformer games in general should feel very pleased. While the game has some shortcomings that prevent it from being a masterpiece, it still delivers some memorable beats.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4</a> PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for select games.</p>



<p>The 0.11.0 version, which can now be downloaded from the emulator's official website, introduces several technical changes and improvements that, by themselves, don't mean much to any regular user for the most part. In reality, these mark a significant improvement for the emulator regarding Unreal Engine-powered games, as many now boot on the emulator, and some are even in a playable state, although it will take a while to see the most advanced games run well on the emulator due to how technically demanding the engine is to emulate with complex shader pipelines and more. You can learn more about these changes with the official <a href="https://shadps4.net/post/shadps4-v0110-relased/">update notes.</a></p>



<p>The ShadPS4 emulator is the most advanced PlayStation 4 emulator available, and the one that is making the fastest progress among those in development. In just a few weeks last year, FromSoftware's Bloodborne, one of the most popular PlayStation 4 exclusive games that have yet to be ported to any other system, went from <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">barely bootable</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">fully playable even on dated systems</a> with better visuals and performance, thanks to the hard work of modders such as fromsoftserve who released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">visual overhaul </a>that is on par with many official remasters released in the past. After focusing on improving Bloodborne's emulation as much as possible, the emulator's developers have moved onto other PlayStation 4 exclusives, which the emulator is running better and better with each new release.</p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After an<a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/"> initial delay</a> that pushed the game out of the first half of 2025, Grimlore Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow-dropped</a> Titan Quest II in early access this summer and had a strong launch with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">300K copies sold in less than three days</a>. Now that the game has been out for a few months, Grimlore Games is preparing to release the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/508466096994518144">first major content update</a> for Titan Quest II, which will be in players' hands "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>The update will be Chapter 2 of the game's story and take players further into the Northern Beaches. You'll have to work to uncover the truth of Nemesis' plans while she continues to hunt you, and you try to find ways to become more than just a mortal if you want to be capable of defeating a god.</p>



<p>The new World Quests in the game will see you aid a crew of travelers who find themselves shipwrecked, which also turns into your own quest to find buried treasure. The update will also include a new chapter boss, Skylla, new enemies to defeat, and further refinements and tweaks to the game.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's no specific release date for when Chapter 2 will be available, nor are there more specific details on what'll be included, but Grimlore Games does have a roadmap for its early access plans that players can view to know what's coming next.</p>
