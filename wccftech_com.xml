			<p>We've known that a new <strong>Mass Effect</strong> (which we'll call <strong>Mass Effect 5</strong> in this story for the sake of simplicity) was coming ever since <strong>late 2020</strong>. At that year's edition of The Game Awards, developer <strong>BioWare</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-teaser-trailer-direct-sequel-to-me-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a brief trailer showing an aged <strong>Liara T'soni</strong></a> and subtly hinting at a direct sequel to the original trilogy, skipping the latest franchise installment, <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017's Andromeda</a></strong>.</p>



<p>More than five years later, <strong>we've still got very little to go on</strong>. Another brief teaser <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-n7-day-tease-mass-effect-andromeda-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published on N7 Day 2023</a>, but BioWare was still very much focused on releasing <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard first</strong>. Immediately after that game launched, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that it would start working in earnest on Mass Effect 5</a>, rather than making any DLCs for The Veilguard. </p>



<p>Last year, we finally got a little more during N7 Day, when franchise Executive Producer <strong>Mike Gamble</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans that the studio had 'a lot of universe to cover, a lot of features to build, and a lot of romances to figure out'</a>. In the blog post, <strong>there was also a secret message</strong> that the community decoded in a few hours; it was a new artwork that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mass-effect-game-to-feature-krogan-civil-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongly hinted at a Krogan civil war</a></strong> as one of the themes of Mass Effect 5.</p>



<p>Even after all these teases, though, there's a lot we don't know. For example, is it going to be a linear game or an open world game? <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Press Box PR</a>, former Bethesda developer <strong>Bruce Nesmith</strong>, who was the Lead Designer on <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong>, expressed the hope to see the latter, as he believes fans have long been pining for an open world game set in BioWare's sci-fi IP.</p>



<p><em>I would hope that they would try to just take their lore and make a modern game of it. One of the knocks on Mass Effect that I would have is that they always felt like they were a generation behind. I know, they had very cool characters, they had great stories, but the gameplay always felt dusty and old. It just wasn’t there. If they can take the things that they were so good at and do it in a more modern sense, I think that they'd have a fantastic game.</em></p>



<p><em>I think taking lessons from Baldur's Gate 3 would fit Mass Effect really well. They already had that kind of style in their games and Larian Studios had the advantage of having produced the Divinity and Divinity 2 games. They were able to use that engine for it. But I think they should probably try to make a more Bethesda-style game, to be honest. I think Mass Effect players are dying for an open world science fiction game that has that kind of flavor to it. A big open world content heavy game? I think Mass Effect players would be going nuts for that. But I’m a former Bethesda guy so I’m probably going to say that about a lot of things.</em></p>



<p>Truth be told, though, <strong>it doesn't seem like a great idea</strong>. On paper, it could be amazing, but <strong>history has shown that BioWare doesn't really do well with open world design</strong>. Mass Effect: Andromeda, for example, featured open world elements but is by far the weakest game of the series in terms of reception. Even <strong>Dragon Age: Inquisition</strong>, which won several GOTY awards and remains the most recent successful release of the Canadian studio, was criticized for its open world zones. Indeed, the following franchise entry, The Veilguard, returned to more linear exploration.</p>



<p>So, don't bet too much on Mass Effect 5 being an open world game. Then again, neither are two clearly Mass Effect-inspired upcoming games: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-gamescom-qa-mass-effect-suicide-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Owlcat's The Expanse</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-qa-compared-to-mass-effect-were-trying-to-make-the-choices-a-lot-more-morally-ambiguous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archetype's EXODUS</a></strong> have both chosen the same structure as the original Mass Effect trilogy rather than a full open world design. Besides, even Bethesda itself <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-dev-space-inherently-boring-planets-is-where-bethesda-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled with making a great sci-fi open world game taking place across many planets</a>, as shown with <strong>Starfield</strong>. It's clearly not an easy proposition by any means.</p>

			<p>With the understanding across the tech industry being that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">"<em>no one can escape memory shortages</em>,</a></strong>" with price increases for devices already directly impacted by the shortages and rising cost of RAM, the question of popular consoles, like the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, getting a price increase seems inevitable and <a href="https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/">more like <strong>a question of 'when,' instead of 'if.</strong>'</a> </p>



<p>So far, Nintendo has been cautious on the topic of price increases for the Nintendo Switch 2. When tariffs were the major factor potentially impacting the price of the console, Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong> made it clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">the price of the console could be increased</a>, but those comments were always just warnings to prepare players for a potential circumstance, rather than something that would happen.</p>



<p>In response to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">rising costs of memory and RAM shortages</a>, Furukawa has taken the same approach. Last month, Furukawa said that Nintendo <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/">"<em></em><em>must monitor the situation closely</em>,"</a></strong> not saying that prices would increase, and that, at least for now, players can expect the price of the console to remain where it is.</p>



<p>As part of the Q&amp;A section from Nintendo's recent financial report, Furukawa reiterated that sentiment, and added that he doesn't want to be "<em><strong>overly influenced</strong></em><strong>" </strong>by what could potentially just be a short-term phase for the industry. Furukawa also said (via machine translation), "<em>Price changes will be determined comprehensively, taking into account not only profitability but also the adoption of the platform, sales trends and market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>The Switch 2 sold <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-17-million-first-switch-best-selling-console/">17.37 million units in 2025</a>,</strong> marking an incredible launch year for the hybrid console. Even with rising memory costs, if Nintendo can keep selling Switch 2 units at a good pace, that increases the likelihood that it will be able to offset any profitability losses from manufacturing the console through software sales.</p>



<p>Of course, it could end up being that memory costs reach such a degree that Nintendo can no longer eat the offset the cost through software alone, and needs to cut its losses as much as it can by increasing the cost of the console, but at least for now, it seems like we can expect the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 to remain where it is.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong>, the studio behind the biggest flop and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">worst-reviewed game of 2025</a>, <strong>MindsEye</strong>, is still chipping away at fixing and improving the game that was the butt of its fair share of jokes last year. The game's latest update, <strong>Update 7</strong>, is "<em>a big step forward</em>" for both the game and the studio, according to <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, chief executive and chief technical officer at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p>The new update focuses on improvements to "<em>campaign flow, making objectives easier to follow, and continuing to refine AI behavior</em>," the patch notes on the <a href="https://support.mindseye.game/hc/en-gb/articles/41491756760205-Update-7">game's official website reads</a>. The tangible effects of that statement include more objective markers and viewpoint locations in certain missions, changes to mission design, like removing an "<em>unfair</em>" failure condition in one mission and increasing a character's health in others for a more balanced experience.</p>



<p>Gerhard also confirmed that the studio is working on new content for the game, but it feels like that might be putting the cart before the horse, since Build a Rocket Boy has to get MindsEye to a more playable, acceptable state before it can get players excited about new content.</p>



<p>"<em>Update 7 is <strong>a big step forward for MindsEye, and our studio</strong>,</em>" Gerhard said in a press release. "<em>I want to thank everyone who's been playing and sharing feedback, and our dedicated team who have worked incredibly hard to continue to delight our community. We've listened, we've moved quickly, and we're continuing to refine performance, make continuous improvements, and deliver substantial combat and gameplay enhancements.</em> <strong><em>New content is in</em> <em>development</em></strong><em>, and we're committed to steady, meaningful progress. Our core focus remains on delivering the MindsEye experience we always envisioned and the one our players deserve</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even before MindsEye launched last year, there was reason to suspect things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two of the studio's chief executives left the company,</a> just two weeks before the game was due to come out. Prior to those departures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">early previews of the game had been very negative</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game getting out in the wild early, without a day-one patch</a>, fueled many of the memes that came out of the game.</p>



<p>Not that those meme creators needed the unpatched version to harp on the game. Even after its day-one patch, the game was in such poor shape that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation offered players refunds</a></strong>, and the studio said it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a> with how the game's launch had gone. </p>



<p>Following the poor launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">the studio suffered <strong>mass layoffs</strong>,</a> while founder and<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, blamed internal and external "<em>saboteurs</em>"</a> for the game's poor state. Developers at Build a Rocket Boy, however, lay the game and the studio's issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">at the feet of Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the management team</a>, with an open letter calling out Benzies for his poor management and behaviour. </p>



<p>Shortly after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC revealed more about the studio's internal issues,</a> which, once again, pointed to Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the studio's leadership as the source of the problems. Most recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">a report from last month pointed to Build a Rocket Boy and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ending their publishing deal,</a> with Build a Rocket Boy said to be the one choosing to end the deal so it could have more control over it and MindsEye's future.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to fix MindsEye and deliver a game truly worth experiencing, then that'll be one of the greatest comebacks in video game history. But it'll take a lot more than just a bunch of bug fixing to get there. For all its technical faults at launch, underneath the bugs, <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> was always a world-class RPG. MindsEye didn't get a <strong>37</strong> on Metacritic just because it was broken on release. Even when it was working, players still called out its flawed gameplay, design, and narrative.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to redeem the game, that redemption won't come without significant changes. It may even be an entirely different game by that point, if Build a Rocket Boy is able to get there.</p>
