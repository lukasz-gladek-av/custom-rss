			<p>Patch 8.0 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> today for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, adding several features and new content. The main addition is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siege Mode</a>, a new PvE mode that expands on the existing Operations mode to include endless enemy waves that can challenge even the strongest teams. When players are overwhelmed, they can call for reinforcements. They'll engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring a different strategy. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing the resources needed to summon either elite Space Marines or the formidable Dreadnought, which can drastically shift the balance of power on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Compared to the build previously available for testing on the Public Test Server, Saber Interactive has reworked the wave timer limit so that, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can become very short on higher waves, there is now a timer for the entire session. Each time players beat a wave, the timer increases.</p>
<p>The developers of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 have also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves, meaning that enemies will become stronger more quickly after the 15th wave. These changes will ensure players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Additionally, the timer may be entirely removed in the future. Moreover, an option has been introduced to disable bot spawning in Private Mode.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 also received some major technical improvements for the PC version. There's now an experimental ray traced ambient occlusion feature (RTAO) that can be toggled on in the graphics settings, and NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is now fully supported, delivering better visuals with the latest transformer model and faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

<p>There are also many other balance tweaks and additions in the patch. Last but not least, Saber said they are preparing a significant update to the customization system, which will let players reuse chapter champion armor parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping, and technical restrictions). This will be in a future update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 7 million units sold, and the developers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3.</p>
