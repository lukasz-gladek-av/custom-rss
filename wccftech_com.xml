			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1986748540744519784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by LinkedIn researcher extraordinaire Timur222, an Executive Producer who worked at Free Range Games until last week (she was unfortunately just laid off, as so many game developers nowadays) has practically confirmed that The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will be getting a sequel. On her LinkedIn profile, she wrote: </p>



<p><em>As Executive Producer and Studio Executive at Free Range Games, I lead large-scale creative and technical initiatives that drive the development of AAA titles across global teams. My work includes overseeing the post-production lifecycle of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria franchise (and sequel) and a new unannounced IP with a $100 million budget and a 130-person distributed team. I partner closely with executive leadership to define production strategy, strengthen operational efficiency, and align project milestones with studio growth objectives. Beyond production oversight. I play a key role in building a culture of trust and accountability, mentoring producers, and advancing sustainable remote collaboration models that enhance delivery consistency and team cohesion.</em></p>



<p>It seems like the independent developer based in Sausalito, California, has two big projects on the works: a sequel to 2023's survival crafting game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which has clearly done well enough to warrant another entry, and an even bigger unannounced project with a nine-digit budget.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as covered a couple of weeks ago, Free Range Games is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durins-folk-dlc-adds-20-hours-new-content-the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a>, which will introduce around twenty hours of new content to The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, not to mention new features such as recruitable NPCs with specific skills.</p>



<p>The DLC will add an area known as Durin's Tower, trading camps near Moria’s gates, and the recruiting camp at Dimmer Dale. New gameplay elements include recruiting dwarves with specific skills. In Durin's Folk, players will also manage delvings (mining bases) with buildings. The DLC will go live on November 18 on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p>It's certainly good news for Tolkien fans who love videogames, especially following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second cancellation of Amazon's MMO</a>. According to a recent rumor, there may be yet another project based on The Lord of the Rings: an action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly created as a rival to Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
