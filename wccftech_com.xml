			<p>Pearl Abyss has unveiled a brand-new gameplay video from their upcoming open-world action-adventure game, Crimson Desert. This game is not to be confused with the MMORPG Black Desert Online. The video showcases the intense boss fight players will have against Hexe Marie. If you want to see what you'll be up against when fighting Hexe Marie, you can check it out in the combat video below, which is just under seven and a half minutes, showing you all of the frightening moves you'll have to contend with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert â€“ Hexe Marie Boss Battle Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrQgbLuIzq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many boss fight videos have been posted on the official Crimson Desert YouTube channel, including videos of <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/">some early gameplay</a> that showcases the environments and exploration that players can expect to experience for themselves.</p>
<p>The battle with Hexe Marie is a little bit different from the other boss fights that have been showcased by Pearl Abyss, as Hexe Marie is a two-phase fight. Not only do players have to fight off against Hexe Marie, but they also have to kill the waves of her summoned minions, which leads to an incredibly intense fight.</p>
<p>Kliff can use ice arrows and explosive arrows to take out the hordes of minions that she summons. While this is just one option, there are many different ways for the player to experiment in battle to create their own strategies to overcome the target.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, Crimson Desert takes place in the huge continent of Pywel and tells the tale of Kliff and his comrades as they go on an extensive journey to fulfill their mission while finding secrets and uncovering new mysteries about their lived-in home world. While the game doesn't have a release date yet, it's set to release simultaneously on PC and consoles when the time comes.</p>
<p>In addition to the fight and the gameplay elements that are being shown in this video, Pearl Abyss has also drawn attention to some of the changes they've made since the first public hands-on demo of the game at Gamescom 2024. This includes updates to the user interface and the target lock system in particular, both of which are essential tools to the player.</p>
