			<p><strong>PlatinumGames</strong> fans may have a lot to look forward to, if the latest rumour is indeed correct. Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bayonetta/comments/1rg4sx7/unconfirmed_rumor_new_bayonetta_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a>, but originating from a Chinese games forum, it's been claimed that Platinum has <strong>three titles</strong> in the works. A <strong>new UE5-based Bayonetta game</strong>, a <strong>remake of the first Bayonetta game</strong>, and a remake of <strong>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</strong>.</p>



<p>It's definitely a lot for one rumour, and it's also coming through a translation layer, both of which should be indications that you should, like all rumours, take it with a <strong>grain of salt</strong>. What at least makes this rumour worth pointing out is that this is a source that has accurately reported information about <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong> ahead of its release.</p>



<p>So that lends it a shred of credibility, but it's just a shred all the same. All we're saying is don't get your hopes up too much, and at the same time, PlatinumGames has to be working on something now that Ninja Gaiden 4 is out the door and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-two-masters-dlc-release-date/">first bit of DLC is arriving next week.</a></p>



<p>Basically, the notable points of the rumour begin with there being a new Bayonetta game in the works, that is being made with Unreal Engine 5, which we likely won't see until sometime in <strong>2028</strong>. The source also claims that this game will have a budget that's on-par with <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong>. That's what we supposedly have to look forward to in the long term.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we'll be treated to remakes of the first Bayonetta game and Metal Gear Rising; Revengeance, both of which the rumour claims are also being made in UE5. They'll supposedly be announced sometime in 2026, with a release set for <strong>2027.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there are elements to this rumour that can definitely raise a suspicious eyebrow or two. In particular the notion that the new Bayonetta game will get the same scale of funding that a company like <strong>Square Enix</strong> can put behind a major<strong> Final Fantasy</strong> game. </p>



<p>But at the same time, PlatinumGames has to be working on something now that Ninja Gaiden 4 is out the door, and that could very well be a new entry in the Bayonetta series, especially if we go back to the fact that series creator <a href="https://wccftech.com/bayonetta-series-continue-kamiya/"><strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> shared that the series would likely continue without him at PlatinumGames.</a></p>



<p>And with <strong>Konami</strong> putting in the work to finally make the full <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> library playable on modern consoles with the<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/"> <strong>Metal Gear Solid Collection</strong></a> titles, who's to say that Konami wouldn't continue to exhaust its remake/remastering options for new MGS content by getting PlatinumGames to bring back the most action-packed Metal Gear game? That's probably an easier sell to players than trying to make a new MGS game without <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong>.</p>



<p>Still, take this all with a grain of salt, especially because the more credible bits of news we've heard with regard to what PlatinumGames could actually be working on next are the recent confirmations that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-continue-game-breaks-10m-units-sold/"><strong>NieR: Automata</strong> will continue,</a> which came alongside the news that the game had sold over <strong>10 million copies</strong>, and a job posting from <a href="https://wccftech.com/platinumgames-appears-to-be-hiring-for-an-online-action-game-despite-babylons-fall-spectacular-failure/">August 2025</a> that pointed to PlatinumGames hiring for an online action game.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have some official word on what PlatinumGames is making sooner rather than later. </p>
