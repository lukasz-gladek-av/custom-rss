			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display has been bashed a few times already since the console's release earlier this month, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest analysis from Monitor Unboxed</a> is perhaps even more damning. We already knew of the nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-existent HDR capabilities</a> and of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variable Refresh Rate issues</a>, but Monitor Unboxed, which regularly reviews PC displays, has now measured the screen's response time, and the results are really disappointing.</p>
<p>While the channel couldn't perform testing with their usual tools for monitors, they manually conducted a series of 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure the response time of the Nintendo Switch 2 display set to 60Hz (as there are no current games that support the maximum 120Hz). The test's average was 33 milliseconds, which makes the screen far slower than typical PC monitors that range between 6 and 20 milliseconds. What's even more surprising, though, is that the display is around 50% slower even than the original Nintendo Switch, which measured 21 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Monitor Unboxed postulates that one of the reasons behind this underwhelming measurement could be the lack of Overdrive technology, which is pretty much mandatory on most displays nowadays but would require higher voltage, which, in turn, would affect the device's overall battery life, a critical feature of a handheld console. This is especially important for the Nintendo Switch 2 since it already comes with a larger display (7.9 inches versus 6.2), a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p), and higher brightness (430 nits versus 310 nits) compared to the original Nintendo Switch, all of which impact the battery life.</p>
<p>Because the display's response time is approximately twice the 16.7 ms frame interval at 60 Hz, it cannot fully update before the next refresh. This results in persistent blur trails and poor motion clarity, as seen in the <a href="https://www.testufo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blur Busters UFO test</a> performed in the video. Furthermore, Monitor Unboxed reckons that the 120 Hz capability will not significantly improve motion since the panel cannot keep up with the faster refresh cycles anyway.</p>
<p>The only real solution to this issue will be an OLED Nintendo Switch 2 display, which will inevitably offer far superior response times (and, therefore, motion clarity), not to mention greatly superior contrast, which will also improve the console's mediocre HDR representation. Meanwhile, pretty much the only upside to the current LCD screen (other than the aforementioned improvements) compared to the original Switch is its far better wide color gamut support, which covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color space, up from the 79% of the previous console.</p>
<p>Despite all these shortcomings, the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling like hotcakes</a>, proving that most of Nintendo's user base doesn't really care about such topics.</p>

			<p>It's game over for Hytale, the long-awaited Minecraft-style sandbox game, and its studio, Hypixel. The news was <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> this week on the game's official website, where Director Aaron Donaghey wrote:</p>
<p><em>Game development is brutally hard - especially when you’re trying to build something original that speaks to a creative, passionate community. Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</em></p>
<p>The game was going to be set in a procedurally generated fantasy world featuring RPG-style combat and dungeons. Of course, as you'd expect in a Minecraft-inspired game, there would also be block-based construction and mods. Hytale would have been published by Riot Games, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Hypixel Studios in April 2020. In the cancellation letter, Hypixel thanked Riot for their support of the personnel following this transition:</p>
<p><em>We’re also deeply grateful to Riot - not just for the years of support and the opportunities they gave us, but for the care they’re showing our team during this transition. They supported us in going out into the world to see if there were investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward. And now, as we begin winding things down, they’re ensuring our team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next. It’s not just thoughtful - it’s human. And it shows a genuine effort to take care of the people behind the work.</em></p>
<p>The original Hypixel server in Minecraft is not affected and will remain operational.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/">Little Nightmares Showcase</a> today, which the company announced was happening just last week, and it revealed a lot more than what players originally expected.</p>
<p>The expectation was that it would be a showcase focused on Little Nightmares III, with new gameplay and a release date revealed, which did happen. Bandai and Supermassive Games announced that Little Nightmares III will arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on <strong>October 10, 2025.</strong> We also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2baUKpm5k">10-minute look at gameplay</a> from a Carnevale level in the game, and the confirmation that it'll also release on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was the announcement of several new Little Nightmares projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Showcase Event" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa85Ns7uegc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, a remaster of the original game, Little Nightmares: Enhanced Edition, was announced, though in a bit of an odd way.</p>
<p>The remaster will arrive on all platforms on October 10, same as Little Nightmares III. Players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC will be able to play the game at a 4K resolution at 60 FPS, with improved graphics, ray-traced reflections, faster loading times, revised checkpoints, and new assistance mechanics.</p>
<p>But if you want to experience the original game with all of that right now, you can, by pre-ordering a digital version of Little Nightmares III. To be clear, this enhanced edition remaster <strong>will not be out</strong> for players to buy separately for $39.99 until October. But pre-order LN3, and you'll get access to it "<em>immediately</em>," as part of your pre-order purchase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - Comparative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6bX6GUEqFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the one hand, it's not a bad deal to get the new version of the original and the next game in the series at no extra cost when you pre-order the third game. The Enhanced Edition of the first game is available for pre-ordering any edition of LN3, from the standard to the premium collectors edition. On the other hand, the enhanced edition Tarsier did for <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-ii-tease-gamescom/">Little Nightmares II</a> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/little-nightmares-ii-enhanced-edition-out-today-on-ps5/">free</a> for those who already owned the game, which is not the case with the enhanced edition of the first Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been mixed online, though it'll be interesting to see if fans attempt to push Bandai Namco to make this new enhanced edition available now for players who want to get it without pre-ordering the third game.</p>
<p>The next major news of the showcase was a Little Nightmares VR game called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes. Very little about this game was revealed, with Bandai only showing a short teaser trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes – Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CvZB0nFaoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other new projects revealed were a new audio podcast, called The Sounds of Little Nightmares. A comic series, called Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, and a novel, called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Little Nightmares Descent to Nowhere - Comic Book Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FK30jqgA_oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, five Little Nightmares projects were revealed, on top of the news we already expected with the release date for Little Nightmares III. There was even a small teaser for a sixth project for the series that looked like it could potentially be a stop-motion film or TV adaptation. We can't say for sure, because the teaser was inserted partway through the showcase, and not discussed again. Hopefully, we'll hear more about it soon.</p>
