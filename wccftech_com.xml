			<p>One of the final events for Summer Game Fest 2025 was solely focused on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-will-join-geoff-keighley-to-host-a-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-during-summer-game-fest/">'game premiere</a>' that featured a panel hosted by Geoff Keighley, with the panel featuring Hideo Kojima, Shioli Kutsuna, Troy Baker, and Woodkid.</p>
<p>The panel discussed multiple aspects of the coming game, with Woodkid digging into aspects of writing music for the game, while Baker and Kutsuna spoke about the characters they play in the game and working with Kojima as actors, in between short clips of cutscenes from the game being debuted.</p>
<p>But the highlight of the show was the live demo, during which a member of the Kojima Productions development team played bits of the game's early hours on a PlayStation 5 Pro while Kojima narrated what was going on.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is almost here, with the game set to release on June 26, 2025, so the panel was consistently cautious about not revealing too much. That said, a live gameplay demo is something that we rarely see in today's era of digital presentations, compared to when E3 was in full swing. Even though we've already seen a lot of Kojima Productions' next game, the live demo was a welcome showcase of what's to come later this month when it launches on PS5.</p>
<p>This game premiere was also the kick-off event for what will be a worldwide touring show, which will head to Australia, Japan, France, England, Korea, Taiwan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Italy, between now and November 2025.</p>
<p>Full details and dates on the tour <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-world-strand-tour-2?dm_i=74N0,2ARDF,2EYVRT,6HFOC,1#m-scroll-target">are still to come,</a> and it'll be interesting to see if this panel is any indication as to what those attending the show in a few months can expect.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> took almost two years to launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but it seems like the long wait was well worth it, judging by the quality of the port.</p>
<p>New videos shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheXboxTester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Xbox Tester</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FuzionXboxTesting"> Fuzion Xbox Testing</a> provide a quick look at the Xbox Series X|S ports of the latest main entry in the long-running JRPG series by Square Enix, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version of the game is comparable to the PlayStation 5 version in pretty much every way, delivering the same image quality and performance in the two available display modes. Sadly, Square Enix did not take advantage of the late port to update AMD FSR from the old version used in the PlayStation 5 release, but that was expected.</p>

<p>While Final Fantasy XVI running on Xbox Series X as it does on PlayStation 5 is not really surprising, considering how similar the two systems are, seeing the game run on Xbox Series S is way more interesting. Despite some predictable limitations, such as lower resolution output and 30 FPS lock for its single display mode, the game seems to run rather well, keeping the framerate locked to 30 FPS consistently. Seeing how even on PlayStation 5 the game often drops way below 60 FPS in many scenarios in Performance Mode, it's undeniable that seeing Final Fantasy XVI run well on Xbox Series S, everything considered.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's launch on Xbox consoles will be followed soon by the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade.</p>
