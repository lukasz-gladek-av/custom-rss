			<p>Katsushiro Harada, a General Manager at Bandai Namco and the man everyone identifies the Tekken series with, is leaving the company at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Truth be told, we already had an inkling earlier this year, when Harada shared on his LinkedIn page that he was 'open to work' and interested in roles such as Executive Producer, Executive Game Director, Vice President, Business Development, Business Development Executive, and Marketing. </p>



<p>When Tekken fans panicked, he <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied on X</a> not to worry about it, that he just wanted to 'meet more people' and 'expand his horizons in the future'. Now, though, there's no uncertainty <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403720328897671168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his LinkedIn message</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. [...] I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything.</em></p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada has been involved with the Tekken franchise since the beginning of his nearly 32-year career at Bandai Namco. For the first two installments, he was credited as the voice actor for characters Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu; however, he was promoted to Game Director starting with Tekken 3 in 1997.  As he mentioned in the message, he also worked on other games, like SoulCalibur IV, Ace Combat Infinity, and Pokkén Tournament. More recently, he was also listed as a producer for games published by Bandai Namco, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/man-of-medan-rusted-seaworthy-ghost-ship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Arise</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, his final major project was Tekken 8, which received widespread critical acclaim (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earning a 9/10 on Wccftech</a>) and sold exceptionally well. The publisher would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-has-sold-2-million-units-in-one-month-says-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> that the game sold two million units in its launch month and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-hits-3-million-sold-year-after-launch-milestone-faster-than-tekken-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached three million units</a> one year after its release, outselling its predecessor in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>As a final parting gift for fans, Harada released an hour-long TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), something he always wanted to do but never got the time for. It is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SoundCloud</a>.</p>



<p>Harada will appear as a guest at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, having been invited by Bandai Namco. As for what's next for him, he said he'll let the fans know at a later date.</p>
