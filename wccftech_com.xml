			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> has been one of the most popular games of 2025 so far, and has already introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-release-date-update/">several famous Marvel characters</a> to its roster, with more on the horizon. But if you were wondering if NetEase would ever go beyond the limits of the vast list of characters in the Marvel universe, that option seems significantly more likely after recent comments from the game's director, Guangguang.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals">MP1st</a>, when asked if making an original character was something NetEase was even allowed to do, Guangguang confirmed that NetEase does in fact have Marvel and Disney's approval to make an original character for the game. As to whether NetEase will take advantage of that free reign, Guangguang simply said to "<em>Stay tuned</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, we are allowed to introduce original characters in Marvel Rivals</em>," Guangguang said in response to the question of whether NetEase could even go that route.</p>



<p>Guangguang doesn't confirm or deny that they're looking to make an original character, but it's exciting for players and Marvel fans to know that the option is open to the studio. Though, as interesting as it would be to see NetEase create their own Marvel character, it's worth wondering if that is even worth the time and investment with a game like Marvel Rivals, that leans so heavily on NetEase taking well-known existing characters from the Marvel universe and putting their own artistic spin on their design and gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>NetEase puts its own stamp on the Marvel franchise with its sharp designs for each character. It doesn't necessarily need to go the extra step and create a wholly original character, but it's nice to know that the option is there for the team if they ever decide to use it. And who knows, there could be one waiting in the wings to be announced with the game's next major update.</p>



<p>As Guangguang said, we'll have to wait and see what NetEase does next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CI Games says Lords of the Fallen 2 will be their “Empire Strikes Back” Moment, and a “Darker” Game Than the 2023 Reboot]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-says-lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-their-%E2%80%9Cempire-strikes-back%E2%80%9D-moment-and-a-%E2%80%9Cdarker%E2%80%9D-game-than-the-2023-reboot.1273032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The very first Lords of the Fallen release came in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">2014</a>, and while it was able to find an audience, it ultimately didn't make a huge splash. Despite a myriad of issues, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">2023 reboot</a> fared much better, so much that CI Games has already announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/">sequel in the works</a> for 2026. After spending a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">significant amount of time fixing the 2023 release</a>, the studio is confident that its sequel, titled Lords of the Fallen 2, will be the studio's "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/lords-of-the-fallen-2-ci-games-empire-strikes-back-sequel-darker-title">MP1st</a>, creative portfolio strategist at CI Games, David Valjalo, likened Lords of the Fallen 2 to the famed Star Wars sequel back when the original trilogy was all we knew, or for those who may not have grown up with Star Wars the way Valjalo's generation did, he instead likened it to the studio's Dark Knight moment, the famous sequel in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.</p>



<p>"<em>We're right on track and in the thick of it now</em>," Valjalo said. "<em>The sequel is looking spectacular. I have the privilege of seeing all the juicy behind the scenes bits and pieces - art, animation, combat, - and each day there's something that just stops me in my tracks. It's bloody, bold, brave...it's a true sequel. It improves on the previous game but carries its spirit forward. It's also a darker game, tonally, with a really unique setting and even higher stakes than the last game, if you can believe that. It's our Empire Strikes Back. Or for Gen Z I suppose it's their Dark Knight</em>."</p>



<p>Strong words from a studio that took two years to release an overhauled "<em>2.0</em>" version of their last game that launched with a bevy of issues, so many that our reviewer called it "<em>one of the most frustrating Souslikes ever released</em>." CI Games also recently permanently reduced the price of the 2023 title, and every game in its catalogue, as part of what it called its <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-permanent-price-cut-ci-games/">"<em>player first</em>" commitment</a> that also couldn't help but read like an apology for the fact that they released a product below their standards two-years prior.</p>



<p>If it does hit its 2026 target release window, then perhaps by 2028 it'll be the studio's 'Empire Strikes Back' for the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Destiny: Rising is a new mobile title from developer and publisher NetEase, licensed by Bungie, and it's due out in just 10 days from the time of this writing. It was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October 2024</a>, and since then the hype around it for mobile gaming and Destiny fans has built to the point where now, days before release, NetEase confirms that over 10 million players have pre-registered for Destiny: Rising.</p>



<p>NetEase has also debuted a new trailer for Destiny: Rising, featuring Gwynn the Reaper, a new character who will be playable in Destiny: Rising when it arrives in a little more than a week's time.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pre-registration milestone doesn't just mean a moment of celebration for NetEase, as it's also a boon for the millions of players ready to jump into the fight on August 28. NetEase set rewards that players would receive the more people pre-registered, with 10 million being the final goal to be reached to unlock an exotic ornament.</p>



<p>While these pre-registration numbers are good news for NetEase, it can't help but seem like mixed news for Bungie, because it feels like the most significant Destiny release players are excited for is a game that they didn't have very much to do with.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bungie's in hot water trying to figure out how to re-introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">Marathon</a> to players following its plagiarism scandal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion for Destiny 2 seems to have come and gone without much fanfare.</p>



<p>We'll see if the rest of the year can potentially get a bit better for Bungie. In the meantime, NetEase is prepared to enjoy having two of the biggest games of the year in their portfolio between <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> and Destiny: Rising.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rewilders-the-lost-spring-new-action-roguelite-bafta-winning-herobeat-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bafta-winning-developer-herobeat-studios-announces-next-title-action-roguelite-rewilders-the-lost-spring.1272975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217470/Rewilders_The_Lost_Spring/">Rewilders: The Lost Spring</a> is a new action-roguelite game from the BAFTA-winning developer, Herobeat Studios, the team behind 2022's heart-wrenching indie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">Endling - Extinction Is Forever</a>.</p>



<p>Only the studio's second project and its first self-published title, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, will be heading to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch at some point in the future, as a release date or even a release window for the title was not announced. </p>



<p>According to a press release, Rewilders will feature "<em>some themes with Endling on the story and narrative</em>," but the gameplay is significantly different as Herobeat calls Rewilders a "<em>creature collection</em>" game with <em>"metroidvania-like progression</em>" that's also a "<em>Soulslite</em>," on top of the other descriptors already put to the game as an "<em>action roguelite</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring puts you in the shoes of Abi, who is returning to their home planet after surviving a terrible event that poisoned the surface of their home. You'll collect creatures called Hântu, and bring them along on your missions into the various corrupted biomes you'll attempt to heal.</p>



<p>Levelling up, feeding, and bringing different Hântu along with you on each excursion can help shape your strategic approach to each run, while planting and growing different resources back at your sky base helps unlock permanent upgrades, as is the roguelite tradition.</p>



<p>Even though the narrative will share some themes with Herobeat's debut game, it's good and interesting to see the talented team flex its skills with a new gameplay approach. Hopefully, we'll hear more on Rewilders: The Lost Spring, soon.</p>
