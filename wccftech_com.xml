			<p>We've seen Amazon's TV series adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's original comic book series, The Boys, appear in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-0-season-4-reloaded-the-boys/">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir operators in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a>, Homelander getting added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-gameplay-trailer-release-date/">Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC character</a>, but the series has yet to get its own dedicated video game - until now, that is. Sony Pictures VR and Brazilian studio ARVORE have announced The Boys: Trigger Warning, a VR game coming to PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 in 2026.</p>



<p>The reveal trailer below makes the game feel like a horror title of sorts, with Homelander as the scary monster you're running away from. Which is not entirely off the mark, considering that the show goes to great lengths to make it clear that its version of the world would be a horrifying one to live in, and that people like Homelander are, in fact, monsters.</p>



<p>You step into the shoes of a new original character that is somehow forced into becoming a Supe when a family outing goes awry, and you're exposed to one of the many skeletons buried in Vought's closet.</p>



<p>From there, you join the Boys and plot your revenge on Vought, with cast members from the show, including Laz Alonso as MM (Mother's Milk), Colby Minifie as Homelander's right-hand woman, Ashley Barrett, and P.J. Byrne as Adam Bourke.</p>



<p>Jensen Ackles will also make an appearance in the game as what is described as "<em>a twisted interpretation of Soldier Boy, created exclusively for the game</em>," in a press release. As if Soldier Boy, or any of the super-powered characters in The Boys weren't already twisted enough.</p>

<p>"<em>From day one, we wanted to build an adaptation hand-in-hand with the people who defined this universe</em>," said Ricardo Justus, ARVORE founder and studio head, in a press release. "<em>Working with the show's writers and cast allowed us to bring the edge, humor, and brutality that made the series iconic, delivered with the spark of magic only ARVORE can create</em>."</p>



<p>VR players will recognize ARVORE as the studio behind the Pixel Ripped 1978, 1989, and 1995 games, as well as the studio behind the interactive short The Line and Clawball.</p>

<p>"<em>We're thrilled to work with ARVORE to bring The Boys: Trigger Warning to life in VR</em>," added Lance Sloane, senior vice president of virtual reality at Sony Pictures Entertainment<em> </em>in a press release. "<em>Having the show's creators involved in shaping the experience allows us to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling, and we're grateful to collaborate with our friends at Meta and PlayStation to deliver it to fans</em>."</p>



<p>The fact that the very first video game to be dedicated to The Boys is a VR game is an interesting choice, to say the least. Virtual reality is definitely still growing in popularity, but it's also still quite niche. This does at least explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-video-game-could-happen-but-maybe-not-how-you-expect/1100-6535645/">why Eric Kripke claimed a video game based on The Boys was happening, but that it wouldn't be a "<em>Xbox or PlayStation</em>" game</a>. It seems that no one told Kripke about the PS VR2 version, though.</p>



<p>It'll also be curious to see how many more members of the cast are featured in Trigger Warning. Homelander makes an appearance in the trailer, though with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-teaser-voice-not-right/">Anthony Starr not participating in Mortal Kombat 1's rendition of the character,</a> it's probably a safe bet that Starr won't voice Homelander here. </p>



<p>Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, and Karen Fukuhara are also absent from the list of confirmed cast members for Trigger Warning, though for at least three of those actors, that could be because their characters don't appear in this original story set within the world of The Boys. We know from the screenshots above that Karl Urban's Billy Butcher does make an appearance, so the fact that Urban isn't mentioned as having already signed on for the game probably means someone else will be voicing Billy.</p>



<p>We'll see if ARVORE can capture what made The Boys such a popular TV show in VR form when it arrives on PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 at some point in 2026.</p>

			<p>The flight simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-detailed-pc-requirements-ideal-spec-recommends-64gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has been released today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in September</a>. On the surface, it's only the umpteenth game published by Xbox Game Studios on the platform after the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, and more, with the (once) brand-defining IP Halo <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on the way next year</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an XDA Developers interview</a> with Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise head Jorg Neumann, we learned that it might have been this game that started it all. Neumann had first discussed the possibility internally around two and a half years ago and initially received a no for an answer, but eventually Microsoft came around, kicking off, in Neumann's own words, the avalanche of Xbox games on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p><em>It was my idea, actually. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/microsoft-flight-simulator-leaving-jet-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>, we came out on PC first in August 2020. One year later, we shipped it on Xbox, and we found millions and millions of new fans on Xbox that had never seen the flight sim because they're just not PC gamers. A lot of them thought it was great, and a lot of them stayed. In 2020, it was already 120 GB when we launched as a download. When we were in 2023, I looked at the install numbers, and it was 300 GB. Then we had our content roadmap, and there was so much new stuff that we were doing that we would be over a terabyte. I said, "We need to do something," so we decided to make Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and had the concept of a thin client. Our client is now 8 GB, and instead of putting everyone on your hard drive and making that download huge, we put everything in the cloud.</em></p>



<p><em>That made it possible to go to other platforms, so I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation. It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our President, who then came back to me and said, "Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested." I think that really kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Neumann also adds that the studio worked hard to optimize the game for the PlayStation 5 console and the DualSense controller. Indeed, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 supports the following features on PS5:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adaptive triggers that respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air &nbsp;</li>



<li>Gyro controls to control pitch and roll while flying &nbsp;</li>



<li>Lightbar support to provide visual caution / warning cues &nbsp;</li>



<li>The ability to customize the touchpad to handle a variety of tasks
<ul>
<li>By default, users can control an aircraft’s throttle by swiping across its surface &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The built-in controller speaker plays audio from air traffic control </li>
</ul>



<p>As for his Xbox-to-PlayStation multiplatform claim, there is certainly a grain of truth there in that it might have been the first time Microsoft seriously sat down and considered the possibility of porting one of its games (in this case, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024) to the rival console. However, given the downward trajectory of Xbox console sales and Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-unrealistic-financial-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandate to the Xbox division to increase profits</a> after the expensive acquisitions of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, going multiplatform was really only a matter of time.</p>
