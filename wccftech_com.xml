			<p>Having the most powerful console is a message that no longer works in the current console market, according to the creator of Xbox, as it was a story that only worked in the past for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/?callback=in&amp;code=MZY2ZJDMZDUTOWJKMY0ZYMRHLWE4YZUTZDU1ZWE2ZMQ5YMMZ&amp;state=f568e241a61f4d22b9243c504e3ba67e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer,</a> the creator of the original Microsoft console Seamus Blackley commented on how having the most powerful console back in the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 generation was important, but not so much nowadays, as in that console generation, we were still in the <em>"nascent stages of graphics,"</em> and taking a hit in the cost of goods of the cogs was critical to position the system against the Japanese consoles, one-up them in this regard, and bet on the games being better.</p>
<p>Despite the narrative that having the most powerful console may have helped, the reason to buy any console has always been about the content, and the Xbox creator thinks this hasn't changed at all. What has changed is that this battle for the content has moved away from any sort of technical achievement and is now centered on creating a sort of experience that gets people to want it, regardless of what sorts of visuals it can push. The Nintendo Switch is the prime example of this, as with its content, Nintendo managed to get people to purchase a console released in 2017 powered by underclocked 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>The Xbox creator's statements don't come as a surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on the gaming industry. With Microsoft pushing its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">multiplatform strategy</a>, bringing former Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, and some developers suggesting <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony may follow suit</a>, the importance of content over hardware is becoming increasingly clear, and with future home consoles unlikely to offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-smaller-performance-gains-higher-prices/">massive leaps in visual fidelity without significant price increases that could limit their appeal</a>, making compelling content is set to become more crucial than ever, regardless of the platform.</p>

			<p>Gears of War E-Day may not be too far from release, judging by how long it has already been in development.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/VGTGamingNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGT Gaming News</a>, the game's Senior Level Designer revealed on LinkedIn that the new entry in the popular series has been in active development for five years and two months already. As such, its release may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Gears of War E-Day was announced last year during Microsoft's usual summer showcase, but very little has been said about the game since its reveal. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/">job ad</a> discovered shortly after the game's announcement suggests that the game could be headed to PlayStation 5 at some point, which has become less surprising since the ad has been discovered, as it has been highlighted multiple times by Xbox execs, including Phil Spencer, that<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> there are no red lines</a> regarding bringing Xbox games to other consoles and any game could be considered for a console multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Gears of War E-Day is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X|S. A final release date, or the launch on any other platform besides those that have been announced, has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>

			<p>In June 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Tony Hawk himself that a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remaster/remake had been in development before developer Vicarious Visions got merged into Activision Blizzard. Following that news, fans assumed they wouldn't get a new version of those games, but it seems like good news is coming relatively soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to insider extas1s</a>, a remaster is not only in preparation but will also be shadow-dropped at the next Xbox Game Showcase in June.</p>
<p><em>A professional skater who is already featured in Tony Hawk 1 + 2‚ÄîI'm talking about Tyshawn Jones, an Adidas athlete‚Äîhas confirmed on the Breakfast Club podcast that a new remastered Tony Hawk game is coming soon. So far, so good, and everything's on point. This was mentioned by the guy on the podcast, and it leads us to something we've been waiting for. I‚Äôm talking about a codename at Microsoft, Project Chicago, which is none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4. We already have the 1 + 2 remaster, and now the 3 + 4 remaster is on the way, as this guy said it‚Äôs going to drop soon.</em></p>
<p><em>What I can pretty much confirm for you right now from this video is that it's a video game set to be released in 2025. And I know you might be thinking, "Okay, √Ålvaro, everyone says things are coming out soon," but hear me out‚Äîthis one is actually scheduled for June 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available right after the Xbox summer showcase, which means on the Sunday showcase, they‚Äôre going to do a surprise drop. That surprise drop is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster. Of course, it‚Äôll be available on day one in Game Pass, and you can also buy it on Steam and PlayStation 5. As for Nintendo Switch 2, I can't make any promises because I don't know, but this Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 is dropping as a surprise at the showcase.</em></p>
<p><em>I was just waiting on some statements from people like Tyshawn Jones to back this up. For those of you who follow the channel, I had the name 'Project Chicago,' but I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what it was. Now, I‚Äôve been able to piece things together, and we‚Äôll remember this soon‚Äîwell, maybe not that soon, it depends on how you see it.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft is making it a habit of shadow-dropping stuff. They did it twice at the January Developer Direct with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. It's a solid marketing tactic, although, of course, rumors such as this one kind of take away a bit of the fun of a surprise release. Still, I'm sure Tony Hawk fans wouldn't mind if it turned out to be true.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-rumored-to-sell-video-games-unit-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pok√©mon Go creator Niantic is reportedly in talks to sell its video games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-%E2%80%98pok%C3%A9mon-go%E2%80%99-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit.1112859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, which cites 'several people familiar with the discussions'. According to the report, a deal could be announced in the coming weeks, but there's still no guarantee it will be finalized.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based developer started in 2010 as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within Google. However, it went independent in 2015 following Google's restructuring into Alphabet, Inc.</p>
<p>Niantic made its business in the augmented reality game segment for mobile devices. After their debut title, Ingress, they adapted the location-based technology to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-go-review-the-new-king-of-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pok√©mon Go</a>, arguably one of the biggest financial successes of the last decade. By the end of 2016, the year that saw the game's original launch, Pok√©mon Go had already been downloaded over 500 million times. By 2020, the game had grossed over $6 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>However, following Pok√©mon Go, Niantic was unable to replicate that success, even when using other big intellectual properties. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-without-cute-creatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a> launched in 2019 but never really took off and went offline less than three years later. NBA All-World was even more short-lived, lasting only a few months (between January and June 2023). Some hyped games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-world-of-heroes-is-niantics-next-ar-mobile-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MARVEL World of Heroes</a>, were never even released. Others, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter NOW</a> and Pikmin Bloom, were released but never really became successful. The latter game, for example, only made $44 million in revenue in the first two and a half years of its live service.</p>
<p>That's probably why Niantic is interested in selling off its video games unit to Scopely, which operates big mobile games like Monopoly Go!, Marvel Strike Force, Star Trek Fleet Command, and WWE Champions, among others. Scopely was acquired in 2023 by the Savvy Games Group, which is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), for $4.9 billion.</p>
