			<p>Today, Serbian developer GFA Games announced that the upcoming massively multiplayer online first-person shooter game Pioner will be playable next week from June 9 to 16 as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>The demo will offer access to the full prologue of the game, the central player hub, the Wanderer Pass and five unique quests. Players will also be able to take part in multiplayer activities, including a cooperative raid.</p>
<p>We've been covering Pioner for several years now and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers twice. At long last, the game will be released later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later date. Even if you can't play next week, GFA Games confirmed that an Open Beta will take place later this Summer.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of Pioner from the latest official fact sheet:</p>
<p>Pioner is a post-apocalyptic MMO shooter set on the mysterious Soviet-era island of Tartarus, offering a vast open world spanning over 50 square kilometers. Blending intense PvE and PvP action with player-driven storytelling, the game features faction missions, hidden dungeons, and dynamic environments. Realism takes center stage, replacing traditional health bars and levels with immersive mechanics. High-risk zones like the "Shadowlands" push PvP to the extreme, allowing for chaotic, high-reward battles where alliances are key — or optional.</p>
