			<p>Mafia: The Old Country receives its biggest update since launch today. The 'Free Ride' update introduces many new features and content, including Classic difficulty (which requires careful management of both health and ammunition), new horse and car races, new replayable combat challenges, an optional first-person driving perspective, and a Photo Mode. </p>



<p>Those who'd like to enhance the cinematic flair of their experience in Mafia: The Old Country can now activate Cinema Siciliano, which transforms the game's look into a black-and-white masterpiece inspired by vintage Italian films. Lastly, the Free Ride update also introduces new vehicles, guns, knives, outfits, and charms for players to acquire.</p>

<p>Mafia: The Old Country launched in early August to solid reviews from critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I rated it 8 out of 10 and called it a fine Sicilian Mafia story:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Publisher 2K later boasted of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's sales</a>, revealing that it has been outperforming expectations. A couple of months ago, one of the main actresses from the game, Carina Conti, let slip that she heard the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-greenlit-mafia-the-old-country-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have already greenlighted a new game</a>. This remains unconfirmed for the time being, but the parent company has hinted that the new approach of a shorter, more linear cinematic game has been successful, thus suggesting that developer Hangar 13 will continue down this path in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, we'll keep you updated should there be any new leaks or rumors of a sequel.</p>
