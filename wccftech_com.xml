			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 2020 launch, to the point where players can't wait for what CD Projekt RED has coming next in the sequel currently codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-evolve-much-like-the-witcher-games-in-cdprs-plans/">Project Orion</a>.</p>
<p>According to the creator behind the Cyberpunk series the games are based on, Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt RED will have a whole new city for players to explore, on top of the infamous Night City that players have already spent hours digging into.</p>
<p>Pondsmith revealed the second city during Digital Dragons 2025, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/">VGC</a>) saying, "<em>I'm not as involved directly, but I see the scripts. Last week I was wandering around talking to different department and seeing what they had, like 'this is new Cyberware, what do you think?' I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place...because there's another city that we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that, but there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work, it doesn't feel like Blade Runner</em>," he continued. "<em>It feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'yeah, I can see this working</em>."</p>
<p>It's exciting to consider that we'll have all of Night City, and then a whole new city, potentially even around the same size, to explore in Project Orion/whatever the final official title of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will be. But it'll be a long time before we see it, since CD Projekt RED still has to get through<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-new-saga-pre-production-witcher-remake-cyberpunk-sequel-concept/"> The Witcher 4</a> before it heads back to Cyberpunk.</p>
