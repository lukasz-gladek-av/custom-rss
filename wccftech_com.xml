			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios announced the release of a new premium DLC and free update for the PC/Mac version of the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (consoles will have to wait a couple of weeks as usual).</p>
<p>The premium DLC is called Fallen Banners and introduces two new dungeons to the game: Lep Seclusa and Exiled Redoubt. In Lep Seclusa, the Moth Priests who inhabit the location are under siege, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is determined to seize the power of the Elder Scroll they guard. The Elder Scrolls Online players must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary from an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the scroll's power to change the face of Cyrodiil forever.</p>
<p>In Exiled Redoubt, soldiers of the Alliance War (regardless of their faction) are disappearing, and all traces lead to the namesake Imperial fortress. In this case, players will team up with Battlemage Lucilla to infiltrate this mysterious stronghold and put an end to the plans of a once noble Imperial House before the chaos spreads beyond its stone walls and across Tamriel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players who succeed in emerging victorious Lep Seclusa and the Exile Redoubt will also have the chance to loot and unlock a host of special rewards, including new collectibles, item sets, and Achievements. These include the Tactician's Gold Grate Skin, which can be earned by completing both dungeons on Veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Fallen Banners is currently available to active ESO Plus subscribers. However, there's also a free update, the game's 45th. ZeniMax Online Studios has introduced a visual overhaul to the Starter Zones (Bleakrock Isle, Bal Foyen, Stros M'kai, Betnikh, and Khenarthi's Roost), including improved lighting, improved ground and water textures, updated structures, and the addition of more clutter or props.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Update 45 adds much more, though, between various balance changes, the first stages of console add-on support (which is scheduled to go live in its entirety later this year), and new player response options when talking to story NPCs, in an effort to improve the roleplaying factor in dialogue. For the full patch notes, head over <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/674341/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-3-5-update-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, earlier this year, ZeniMax <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls Online would switch from yearly Chapters to seasonal content. The studio has already scheduled an ESO Direct for April 10 where more information about what's coming this year will be unveiled.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's Xbox next-generation plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld that will reportedly launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">WindowsCentral</a>, it has been revealed that the internal successor to the Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit. As of now, Xbox next generation hardware plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X console that will launch in 2027, alongside a gaming handheld and multiple new controller options which will have direct-to-cloud connectivity and allow users to switch them between different devices. As previously rumored, next-generation consoles will be closer to PCs than ever before and will make it much easier for developers to port games from PC. Backward compatibility will also be available.</p>
<p>While the handheld system that will be part of Xbox next generation plans is still two years away from release, we will get a first taste of a portable experience later this year with an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Keenan that is in the works with a PC gaming OEM. This handheld, according to WindowsCentral's report, will look markedly Xbox with the typical guide button and design sensibilities, and will likely run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as one of its main focuses.</p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft started releasing their former exclusives to other consoles, many have wondered if there are real Xbox next-generation plans. Judging from this report, it definitely looks like the company is not going to leave the hardware market anytime soon. If the new systems will indeed launch in 2027, it won't take long to see how they will deliver the largest technical leap <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">teased</a> a while back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-will-be-used-in-ps5-pro-games-next-year-reveals-sonys-mark-cerny/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> that AMD FSR 4 had been co-developed with Sony as part of the wider machine learning Project Amethyst collaboration, PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect Mark Cerny revealed today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with Digital Foundry</a> that AMD's latest upscaling technology will be introduced to the most powerful console currently on the market in 2026.</p>
<p>This year, Sony plans to focus on helping developers implement the current version of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), but they are already working on the future implementation of AMD FSR 4, or rather, its equivalent tailored for the PS5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4's upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR; it should take the same inputs and produce essentially the same outputs. Doing that implementation is rather ambitious and time consuming, which is why you haven't already seen this new upscaler on PS5 Pro.</em></p>
<p><em>RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in AMD FSR 4. I’m definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability.</em></p>
<p>When questioned about whether the console could handle the increased computational cost of AMD FSR 4, Cerny expressed confidence that the PS5 Pro's 300 8-bit TOPS would make it work. Later in the Q&amp;A, the programmer and game designer returned to discuss both short-term and long-term objectives that are part of Project Amethyst (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a few months ago</a>):</p>
<p><em>The shorter-term goal is to co-develop neural network architectures and training strategies for game graphics. The longer-term goal is to work together to create a more ideal hardware architecture for machine learning, something capable of processing the neural networks needed for game graphics at high speed. PS5 Pro was a wonderful learning experience for us here at SIE, and of course, AMD has an incredible amount of knowledge from its multi-generation RDNA roadmap. Again, it just makes sense to combine those expertises. [...] AMD FSR 4 and this next evolution of PSSR are a paradigm for our future. Going forward, we expect to have our own implementations of each of the algorithms developed through the collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Closing up, he added there might be quite a few tweaks because technical targets for console and PC games are quite different. For example, 60FPS is still believed to be the golden standard for consoles, while PC games aim much higher nowadays.</p>
<p>With FSR 4, AMD definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed the gap with NVIDIA</a>, although the latest DLSS 4 transformer model and the GeForce RTX 50's Multi Frame Generation keep the Green Team ahead. Still, NVIDIA will have to continue investing in advancements, something that users should be thankful for.</p>
