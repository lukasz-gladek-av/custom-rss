			<p>CD Projekt RED did a veritable press tour for The Witcher IV reveal after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer's debut at The Game Awards 2024</a>. After talking about Ciri as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protagonist</a>, revealing her new voice <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>, and confirming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwent</a>, the developers stopped by for an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel Skill Up</a>. Here, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba discussed the game's scope, which is said to be similar to The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p><em> I'll give you guys an anecdote first before I answer the question. I remember when we were thinking about how many hours you would need to, let's say, finish The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. When we threw the numbers, we were like, maybe 5 or 10 hours for Heart of Stone and maybe 10 or 15 hours for Blood and Wine, and we ended up with 30 hours. Of course, empirically, we have so much knowledge regarding the structure of The Witcher 1, 2, 3, the structure of Cyberpunk 2077 and all the expansions, so we use this data. But we look at the scale a little differently. We don't want to be servants to the numbers. </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the map of The Witcher IV is definitely more or less the same when it comes to the size.</em> <em>The amount of quests is also more or less the same, but again, the game is going to be big, but also, the ambition of the entire team is huge. First and foremost, we want to deliver a super compelling experience. So, again, quality over quantity. But definitely, what we can promise is that, yes, this game is going to be pretty big. It's going to be comparable to everything we've done so far, but I cannot tell you if it will be 90%, 85%, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>For the record, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is definitely a huge game. The main story alone can take over 50 hours, and with all the side content, it goes easily above a hundred hours, even if you don't want to complete every single hunt and Easter egg. Still, Kalemba emphasized the studio's focus on quality.</p>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated addendum, the Game Director of The Witcher IV also stressed that this is not the beginning of the game's marketing campaign. It was simply a reveal of the title and the new protagonist. The game entered full production earlier this year, so there's still a long wait ahead for fans - probably a couple of years, if not more.</p>

			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster project mod is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements to the PlayStation 4 exclusive which has become fully playable on PC this year thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator.</p>
<p>The 0.8 version of the mod introduces plenty of improvements over the previous release, such as more point lights, more parallax occlusion mapping, some reflectance map changes, and more. The new features introduced by the new version of the mod are explained in great detail by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, creator of the mod, in the video below. The mod can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

<p>Having a playable PC version of Bloodborne has been a dream for soulslike fans for a very long time, and it has finally become a reality earlier this year, as mentioned above, thanks to the fast improvement of the ShadPS4 emulator over the past few months. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but things continue to improve steadily, and a recent update of the emulator addressed some of the most common issues with the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/">RAM usage spikes, excessive VRAM usage, and frequent crashing</a>. The reduction in VRAM usage is actually a rather significant improvement, as this should allow those with older GPUs to run the game better.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that has made Bloodborne playable on PC can be found on its official website.</p>

			<p>Today has been a day of announcements for Japanese publisher Nihon Falcom, who has revealed an updated version of Ys X as well as the release window and platforms for the previously announced Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, a remake of the first entry in the sprawling Trails series.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the updated version of the tenth entry in the series, which was released only a few months ago in the West. This new version of the game will feature plenty of new features, including a new location, Aland Island, located to the north of Obelia Gulf, where Adol and Karja will meet another mysterious Mana user, learn new Mana Actions, and more. Together with the new story content, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature new bosses, Mana Ride races, and arena battles that will put players' skills to the test. The game has only been announced for Japan as of now and will launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Besides announcing Ys X: Proud Nordics, Falcom revealed today that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which was revealed for Nintendo Switch earlier this year, will also launch on PC and PlayStation 5 during Fall 2025. The game will be published in the West by GungHo Online Entertainment, complete with English and Japanese voice-overs and English, Japanese, French, and German subtitles. A new trailer showcasing the overhauled visuals and combat system over the original was also released today, and you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd9j_NWZGG8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement of more platforms and a release window for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is very welcome, the announcement of Ys X: Proud Nordics so close to the Western release of the original version of the game is far less so, even though it is a completely enjoyable experience, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">review</a>. Hopefully, players won't need to purchase the game again to enjoy the new content, which sounds rather substantial.</p>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 major patch is now live on PC and Xbox consoles, bringing performance and optimization improvements, A-Life 2.0 enhancements, and more.</p>
<p>The massive 1.1 patch, which is a whopping 110 GB big, addresses over 1800 issues, including many of the issues that prevented the game's A-Life system from working properly in Offline, out of the player's visualization range. Plenty of AI "anomalies" were also fixed, and some balance adjustments were made, such as increased rewards for several missions, tweaked damage for PSY fields, and more.</p>
<p>The new STALKER 2 major patch also brings performance and optimization improvements. Largely populated areas of the map should run better in the new version of the game, and performance drops should no longer be an issue in a variety of scenarios and for those running the game on any RTX 3000 series card with AND FSR frame generation. You can check out the massive list of fixes introduced by the new patch by heading over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World, which has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-already-profitable-says-gsc-investor-and-it-might-be-adapted-to-netflix/">become profitable and could be adapted for a TV show</a>, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2%E2%80%99s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us.1065147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana (former NPD) Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3ldljjx7lak2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in a BlueSky post that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed PlayStation 2's lifetime console sales in the United States.</p>
<p>It's undoubtedly a huge milestone. To this date, the PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling console of all time, with around 160 million units sold, although that's a global figure. In the United States, the PlayStation 2 has sold 53 million units, which means the Nintendo Switch is now slightly over that number. There's actually another console that sold even more: the Nintendo DS, with its 57 million units. However, the DS was a handheld-only console, whereas the Switch is a hybrid console, making it directly comparable with the PS2.</p>
<p>Globally, the Nintendo Switch is still a bit far from the PS2. Around three months ago, we learned that the hybrid hardware had sold 146 million units, and its sales have been slowing down over the past year or so. With the Switch 2 about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it's unlikely the original will be able to gather enough momentum to push past the PlayStation 2 and sit on the throne of all-time console sales.</p>
<p>Even so, it remains a smashing success for Nintendo, and it wasn't at all a given. Looking at Nintendo's history, they've gone from successful consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which sold 61.91 million and 49.1 million units, respectively) to much less fortunate projects, like the Nintendo 64 (32 million units) and the GameCube (21.74 million consoles). The Wii returned Nintendo to its glory days and broke the milestone of a hundred million consoles sold, partly thanks to the motion control fad. But then the Wii U was another big flop, selling only 13.5 million units, the lowest ever for Nintendo.</p>
<p>It's hard to gauge what will happen with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, although the fact that it's rumored to carry over the same concepts as the Switch makes fans hopeful it will be another success story. Analysts are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish</a> about it, that's for sure.</p>
