			<p>While Nintendo seems content to wait some more before announcing the Nintendo Switch 2, accessories manufacturers aren't pleased about the system still being kept under wraps, and some have started revealing more about the highly anticipated console.</p>
<p>Accessories manufacturer Genki is showcasing its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories lineup at CES 2025, and reputable French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerama</a> had the chance to check out a mock-up of the system reportedly based on a real system the manufacturer owns and how the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers work. The new mock-up also confirms a bigger size over the original console and a second USB-C port on the top of the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">VIDEO — La Nintendo Switch 2 en avant-première au <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a>.</p>
<p>L'accessoiriste Genki indique posséder la vraie console et expose une maquette 3D + des accessoires.</p>
<p>Les détails ici : <a href="https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1">https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1</a> <a href="https://t.co/IJ6taQggIQ">pic.twitter.com/IJ6taQggIQ</a></p>
<p>— Numerama (@Numerama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the report from Numerama, Genki decided to go all-in with the early Nintendo Switch 2 reveal by adding a short video on its <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> showcasing the full unit and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/">dock</a>. While there's no way to verify if everything is indeed based on the real system or on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">other mock-ups</a>, there's a solid chance the video is showing the real console, given how pretty much everything about it is leaking online.</p>
<p>Genki isn't the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessories manufacturer showing its upcoming products during CES 2025, and Numerama spoke with some of them, who all seem to agree that the system will launch in April. According to some of these manufacturers, it is possible to even purchase the console already on the black market, which, as Numerama highlights, sounds like a bold claim considering nothing has leaked regarding software.</p>
<p>With new leaks and rumors sprouting like mushrooms almost daily, the only thing that is left is for Nintendo to finally announce the Nintendo Switch 2. When the reveal will happen not even these chatty manufacturers know, but with all these daily leaks, it shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds will soon get a second Open Beta test (the first one <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took place</a> in late October) ahead of the full release in late February.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shared the news in a brief new video, where he also introduced the differences fans will find in this new test compared to the previous one. The main addition is that&nbsp;players will be able to hunt the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Other than that, the beta will still feature Character Creation, Story Trial, and the quest to slay Doshaguma. Character creation data will carry over from the previous beta, so if you've played before, you will find your character waiting. Even more interestingly, all this character creation data from the beta tests can be transferred into the full game once purchased. However, no game progress will transfer.</p>
<p>Folks who participated in either of the Open Beta tests will receive special items to be redeemed in the full game: a decorative charm for your weapons or Seikret and an item pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tsujimoto also revealed that CAPCOM is working hard at improving Monster Hunter Wilds in various ways based on feedback from the earlier Open Beta test. However, these tweaks and fixes won't be ready for the second test, which will take place on all platforms between February 6 and 9 (starting and ending at 7 PM Pacific Time) and again between February 13 and 16.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to Monster Hunter World (which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-has-shipped-over-20-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game CAPCOM has ever made</a>, having sold nearly 21 million units on its own and 27 when factoring in the Iceborne expansion), the hype surrounding Monster Hunter Wilds is just as massive as the biggest monsters featured in the game.</p>
<p>In our testing, the anticipation is likely to be fulfilled by the final product, which is out on February 28. In his Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>

			<p>Alongside the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs</a>, CES 2025 also marked the debut of the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a>, a new suite of neural rendering technologies that promises to empower game developers to deliver the next visual leap in graphics. The NVIDIA RTX Kit suite has vast applications, from accelerating ray tracing with AI to portraying much more realistic digital humans to rendering scenes that feature massive amounts of geometry.</p>
<p>Let's begin with what's arguably going to be the biggest innovation. With the Blackwell architecture, NVIDIA is introducing the so-called RTX Neural Shaders. These are small neural networks that are meant to be injected into programmable shaders for various beneficial effects. With the upcoming RTX Neural Shaders SDK, game developers can train their game data and shader code on an RTX AI PC accelerated with NVIDIA Tensor Cores. During the training phase, the neural game data is compared to the output of the traditional data and refined over multiple cycles.</p>
<p>There are currently three main applications for RTX Neural Shaders, all of which we&nbsp;<span>previously covered from NVIDIA's research papers: RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-neural-compression-technique-unlocks-16x-texture-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Texture Compression</a>, RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-real-time-neural-materials-models-up-to-24x-shading-speedup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Materials</a>, and RTX <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a></span>. RTX Neural Texture Compression is invaluable for easily compressing thousands of textures in less than a minute while also saving up to 7x more VRAM compared to traditional block-compressed textures, with no purported downside to quality. In the new tech demo, RTX NTC textures only occupy 80MB, whereas regular block-compressed textures require 520MB VRAM.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-NTC-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>RTX Neural Materials uses AI to compress complex shader code typically reserved for offline materials, delivering up to five times quicker material processing and enabling higher quality assets to be available in games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Materials-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, AI is used in RTX Neural Radiance Cache to infer an infinite number of bounces after the initial one to two bounces, thus improving multi-bounce indirect lighting and performance. NRC has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtxgi-2-0-available-next-frontier-ray-traced-visuals-neural-radiance-cache-spatial-hash-radiance-cache-dynamic-diffuse-global-illumination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for a while</a> as part of the RTX GI SDK and will soon be introduced to RTX Remix and Portal with RTX.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Radiance-Cache-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The RTX Neural Shaders and RTX Neural Texture Compression SDKs will be added to the NVIDIA RTX Kit later this month. Microsoft also <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/enabling-neural-rendering-in-directx-cooperative-vector-support-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that DirectX will soon add support for Cooperative Vectors, providing accelerated performance for GeForce RTX GPUs when using RTX Neural Shaders. Bryan Langley, partner group program manager of Silicon, Media, and Graphics at Microsoft, stated:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft is excited to partner with NVIDIA to catalyze this next generation of graphics programming by bringing industry-wide support for neural shading technology. DirectX will soon support Cooperative Vectors, which will unlock the power of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA GeForce RTX hardware and enable game developers to fully accelerate neural shaders on Windows.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Mega-Geometry-Off-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The NVIDIA RTX Kit also includes RTX Mega Geometry, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut in Remedy's Alan Wake 2</a> with a free update later this year. The CES 2025 demo video provided a preview of the technology, which aims to improve the ray tracing load in scenes with vast amounts of geometry, like in games powered by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. According to NVIDIA, RTX Mega Geometry accelerates BVH building, enabling ray tracing of up to a hundred times more triangles than the current standard. It will be available later this month in the RTX Kit, and soon through the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine branch.</p>

<p>RTX Neural Faces is the tool in the NVIDIA RTX Kit that takes a regular rasterized face with 3D pose data as input and infers a more natural face through a real-time gen AI model. The generated face is trained from thousands of offline generated images of that face at every angle, under different lighting, emotion, and occlusion conditions. The training pipeline can use real photographs or AI-generated images. The trained model is then optimized using NVIDIA TensorRT to infer the face in real-time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Standard-Face-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This is paired with the RTX Character Rendering SDK for hair and skin. With the new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA added Linear-Swept Spheres (LSS), a GPU-accelerated primitive that reduces the amount of geometry required to render strands of hair. LSS uses spheres instead of triangles to match hair shapes more accurately. LSS enables ray-traced hair to be rendered with better performance and a smaller memory footprint. RTX Skin and Hair algorithms using the RTX Character Rendering SDK, which will be available later this month, just like the NVIDIA RTX Kit. The Hair algorithm will debut in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a free update coming soon. The Skin algorithm will be available through RTX Remix, too.</p>

<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA also promised a big update to its Audio2Face technology. Truth be told, we weren't exceedingly impressed with its implementation in GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a> game; the AI didn't do a great job of delivering decent facial animations based on audio inputs. The brief new demo video looks a lot more expressive, though. According to NVIDIA, a new Audio2Face real-time diffusion-based architecture has been implemented to deliver more accurate and detailed lip synchronization, vivid emotions, and natural non-verbal responses.</p>
