			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">It's been over two years since <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> confirmed</a> that it would be making <strong>The Division 3</strong>, and that series creator<strong> Julian Gerighty</strong> would be at the forefront of the project. Since then, Ubisoft has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">major updates and expansions for The Division 2</a>, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, we even got a major reveal of what the company has planned for the franchise, with a new survival extraction game called The Division 2: Survivors and an upcoming mobile MMO title called The Division Resurgence.</p>



<p>As for The Division 3? Ubisoft did not mention it at the time, but during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> when Gerighty was showcasing and discussing The Division 2: Survivors, he also answered a question regarding The Division 3.</p>



<p>While he couldn't say much beyond the fact that the game is still coming and a confirmation that it is in production, he does set the expectation bar quite high for what players can look forward to.</p>



<p>"<em>So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Gerighty isn't saying too much, and he quickly moves on to continue talking about Survivors and Resurgence, since those are the two projects that he was technically supposed to be talking about. But as you'll see from the first few comments under the interview, players were more pleased to just have a few new words on The Division 3. </p>



<p>Hopefully, these aren't the last words we hear on the game before 2026 is done. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong> will officially be seven years old when we get to March 12, 2026, and while Ubisoft Massive has done a great job in maintaining the third-person shooter and updating it with new content, for two, arguably three of those last seven years, all players have wanted to see is a third mainline entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>We likely won't get it in 2026, but hopefully, we'll know to expect it for 2027.</p>

			<p><strong>Hooded Horse</strong>, a publisher that made a name for itself when it picked up <a href="https://wccftech.com/manor-lords-indie-hit-160k-concurrent-steam/">Manor Lords</a> and has since been known to have a keen eye for strategy and city-building games, has drawn its line in the sand on GenAI tech. In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku,</a> Hooded Horse's chief executive officer, <strong>Tim Bender</strong>, made it clear that the publisher will not sign studios that use GenAI.</p>



<p>The studio has even gone so far as to add a <strong>"<em>no f***ing AI assets"</em></strong> line into its contracts, banning any studios that work with it from using generative AI technology in the process of developing their game. "<em>If I sound frustrated, it's because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult</em>," said Bender.</p>



<p>"<em>I f***ing hate GenAI art, and it has made my life more difficult in many ways,</em>" Bender continued. "<em>Suddenly it infests s**t in a way it shouldn't. It is not written into our contracts if we're publishing the game, 'no f***ing AI assets.'"</em></p>



<p>It's a strong stance for the publisher to take, though not a surprising one when you consider the amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">backlash studios like Larian</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a> have received with their admittance of using GenAI tech, and even non-gaming companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/dell-pulls-back-ai-first-push-after-admitting-customers-arent-interested/">Dell admitting that consumers are "<em>not buying based on AI</em>,"</a> signifying that people do not want to hear that AI and GenAI is at the forefront of new products.</p>



<p>That said, Bender goes on to say that simply including the ban on GenAI in the contract and drawing its line in the sand is what's easy. Actually ensuring that developers follow through with the ban is a different story. </p>



<p>"<em>We've gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don't use any GenAI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, 'Okay, well, maybe what I'll do is for this place, I'll put it as a placeholder,' right? Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they'll think, 'It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.' But if that gets done, of course, there's a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something</em>. <em>Because of that, we're constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it's cancerous</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>It's clear that GenAI is going to continue to be a controversial topic in the video game industry when it comes to its use in game development. Some studios, like the aforementioned Embark, will continue to use it without shame or fear, especially when you consider that Embark's latest release,<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"> ARC Raiders</a></strong>, is arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">one of the biggest recent commercial successes in games</a>.</p>



<p>But for Hooded Horse, it's not so much a question of using GenAI being bad PR; it's that the team firmly does not believe in the technology and takes an ethical stance against it. "<em>When it comes to GenAI, it's not a PR issue, it's an ethics issue,</em>" Bender added. "<em>The reality is, there's so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won't allow it in the game, and if it's ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out, and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It's a shame that it's even necessary, and it's a very frustrating thing to have to worry about</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Hooded Horse is just one indie publisher in a sea of publishers. We can't say if another company will take the same approach, but as conversation and controversy around GenAI continue to rise, it wouldn't be a surprise if we start seeing more companies draw their own line in the sand on GenAI.</p>
