			<p>A few hours ago, Rockstar Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the second GTA VI delay. Originally slated to launch in Fall 2025, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was moved to May 26, 2026</a> on May 2, 2025. However, the studio has now requested more time to polish the game, which will launch on November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came just before Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two, announced its Q2 2026 financial results. Predictably, investors questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter during the earnings call; the executive stated that this new GTA VI delay will allow Rockstar not only to surpass but also to exceed the incredibly high expectations of fans. Furthermore, Zelnick highlighted that the developer and publisher had never regretted delaying their games before, whereas some other players in the industry had decided not to delay their games and suffered as a result. Here's the exact quote:</p>



<p><em>The drivers are the desire to deliver as perfect an entertainment experience as we possibly can and to try to live up to consumers’ extraordinary expectations and then exceed those expectations. It is always painful when we move a date. We have done so occasionally in the past, and we have never regretted it in retrospect. I would like to point out that we have some competitors that, in the event where more polish was required and it required slipping a date, they chose not to slip the date, and they did so at their peril.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Rockstar previously delayed key games. Grand Theft Auto IV and V were both delayed once, and Red Dead Redemption 2 got delayed twice. We also know that Rockstar doesn't settle for anything short of extraordinary, and with the sequel to GTA V, the bar is even higher considering that it's the second best-selling premium game of all time after Minecraft.</p>



<p>While the GTA VI delay was clearly the big news of the day, the earnings call also saw questions about other recent releases, such as Gearbox's Borderlands 4. Zelnick admitted that Borderlands 4, despite a strong critical reception, was selling a bit less than expected, and attributed that to the widely reported PC optimization 'challenges' at launch. Still, the executive expressed confidence that over time, the game's performance would be 'very solid' and in line with the original estimates. On the other hand, Mafia: The Old Country was reported as having better than anticipated sales, which probably means we'll get another game in that vein (narrative-focused, relatively short, budget-priced).</p>

			<p>EA and Battlefield Studios didn't just deliver a solid multiplayer experience that players know the Battlefield series for in Battlefield 6. Battlefield Studios has also come up with its response to Call of Duty: Warzone with a new free-to-play battle royale mode called Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<p>After years of battle royale modes being extremely popular, there's a lot that should already be second-nature to anyone jumping into Battlefield REDSEC, like keeping track of your ammo, making sure to find armor, and staying with your squad to have the best chance of staying alive.</p>



<p>All of those general tips apply to Battlefield REDSEC, but like any new battle royale worth its salt, it's not just doing the same thing everyone else does without its own unique twists. That's why there are more than a few tips and tricks this guide will go over to help give you an edge when jumping into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-tips-and-tricks-guide">Battlefield REDSEC Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-beware-of-the-circle">Beware of the Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The always-encroaching circle, which is usually a kind of toxic gas in battle royale games, is a staple of the genre, and it's obvious that you should be aware of it and not let yourself get caught in it. That said, many clever battle royale players have discovered ways in which to use the circle's constant encroachment to their advantage, deliberately moving into it to get into a better position on the map, and potentially flank an opposing squad.</p>



<p>You can't do that in REDSEC because you'll just die instead. The circle is absolutely lethal, and you'll die the moment you find yourself caught in it. If you want to use the circle to reposition in your battle royale, then you can find that in Warzone or Apex Legends, but not in REDSEC.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-avoid-contracts">Don't Avoid Contracts</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your goal in REDSEC, like in any battle royale, is to be the last one standing. Surviving to the end is always the number one priority, but you won't survive if you don't take any risks. Completing contracts is a risk, because they push you into different parts of the map and potentially right into another squad's lap, but they're a risk you have to take.</p>



<p>Completing contracts gets you better gear, with rewards that can be vital to your survival without having to run across the map and scavenge for them. You always want to be improving your loadout, and completing contracts is a quick way to do that while also completing challenges for the battle pass and earning XP. You can also, of course, scavenge for gear while completing contracts as you go from one point to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-pistol">Upgrade Your Pistol</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You won't keep your pistol with you for very long once you drop into a match, but if you plan to start with a hot-drop (choosing to land in a very popular POI with other players all around) you'll probably need to take out at least one of the enemy players in front of you with your pistol.</p>



<p>So it's worth your time to take a few minutes in the menu before you jump into a match and upgrade your pistol with a few attachments. Having a pistol with stats as good as possible could be the difference between winning an opening fight and having to redeploy right away.</p>



<h3 id="h-shakedown-enemies-before-finishing-them-off">Shakedown Enemies Before Finishing Them Off</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a tip that definitely won't always apply, because it requires you to have the space and time to do it. But if you have those things, then once you've downed an enemy, don't just immediately finish them off.</p>



<p>Stand over them before killing them, and you'll be prompted to 'Shakedown' the enemy player. Doing so will reveal where the rest of that player's team is in the moment, helping you finish off the rest of the squad. Of course, if you've already taken everyone else out, this doesn't apply, but it is a key tactic to remember at the beginning of a firefight, and could be the difference between winning and losing.</p>



<h3 id="h-play-your-role">Play Your Role</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The goal in REDSEC is, first and foremost, to be the last squad standing. So it's understandable if your impulse is to go as an Assault or an Engineer, to take advantage of assault rifles or SMGs, weapon classes that'll help you win firefights in most cases. </p>



<p>That's completely fine, but if you're loading up for a match and you see that everyone else on your squad has the same idea of playing as either Assault to help with infantry fights, or Engineer to help with vehicle takedowns and maintenance, and no one is going Support or Recon, the smart thing to do is to step up and be the one to play either Support or Recon.</p>



<p>Of course, the gear you find on the ground will help determine how effective you can be while playing as any particular class, but that doesn't mean you should all go as one or two classes. Having a diverse squad is another layer of being prepared for anything and everything when you jump into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-waste-your-tanks">Don't Waste Your Tanks</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps more valuable than any tier of weapon you can find on the ground in Fort Lyndon when jumping into REDSEC is a Vehicle Card, specifically a tank card. Now, using vehicles in REDSEC is not the same as using them in the regular multiplayer modes in Battlefield 6. They have limited ammo and fuel, so you won't be able to use one for an entire REDSEC match.</p>



<p>So do yourself a favor. If you're lucky enough to get a vehicle card for a tank, don't use it until you're near the very end of the game. Make it your trump card to win the match at the end, and make the most of it.</p>
