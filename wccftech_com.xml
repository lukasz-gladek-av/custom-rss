			<p>On top of Windows Central's claim that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters/remakes would arrive "<em>eventually</em>,"</a> its executive editor, Jez Corden, also added more to the rumour mill on what Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones developer MachineGames has on the go. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">According to the report</a>, the studio is working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game, while also having Wolfenstein 3 "<em>on the cards</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, this time it's not just Windows Central claiming that Wolfenstein 3 is in development. Shortly after the initial Windows Central report, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku published its own</a>, corroborating what Windows Central claimed and, based on conversations it had with its own sources, went as far as to <strong>confirm that Wolfenstein 3 is in fact currently in development.</strong> </p>



<p>It's not shocking to hear that a new Wolfenstein game is coming from MachineGames. <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">Back in September 2025,</a> when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">NoClip</a> released a documentary on the making of the first two games, studio head <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> said, "<em>We have always <strong>seen this as a trilogy</strong></em>. <em>That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one</em>. <em>I think that's important to say, because⁠—at least I hope⁠—we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. <strong>We have a story to tell.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>If that's not a comment meant to prime players for a coming sequel, then there's no telling what is. Gustafsson would have made that comment, fully aware of when the documentary was to be released, with full knowledge of what the studio had coming. Today's reports add further fuel to the fire that we are indeed going to get a third, and seemingly closing chapter of BJ Blazkowicz's story.</p>



<p>The last Wolfenstein game was 2019's Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which focused on Blazkowicz's daughters instead of BJ himself. If a new game in the series arrives this year, it'll have been a seven-year gap since the last game in the series and a nine-year gap since the last game to feature BJ as the protagonist. </p>



<p>Along with a new game seemingly in the works, there's also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">a TV show adaptation of Wolfenstein coming from Amazon</a>, which could likely be revealed at the same time as the third game.</p>



<p>As for the multiplayer game Corden mentions, there's not much else to go on besides the quick description that it is meant to be a "<em>Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title</em>," though if Wolfenstein 3 is going to be ready in time for the coming TV show, then that may be the project the studio is closer to completing. While the idea of a new multiplayer game from MachineGames is exciting, fans of the studio would much rather the team focus on BJ Blazkowicz before anything else.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more official news to share from the studio itself soon.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has revealed a new line of DualSense controllers and PS5 side plates with its new Hyperpop Collection, which features three colourways and is arguably the boldest collection of new colours and designs that PlayStation has done with DualSense controllers and PS5 accessories since the console launched back in 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-new-faceplates-june-2022/">We've had some great solo-colour controllers and face plates</a>, but nothing so far that has tried to be a bit different outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">some limited runs of controllers featuring </a>designs <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-new-limited-edition-ps5-consoles-controllers/">based on individual games</a>. For anyone who remembers the kinds of designs and special editions we'd get back in the PS3 and PS4 days, these latest designs pale in comparison to how creative Sony and PlayStation used to get, but it's still encouraging to see them start branching out from just introducing new colours for controllers.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, we’re sharing the first look at the Hyperpop Collection, featuring three new striking designs for DualSense wireless controllers and PS5 console covers. With glossy blacks shifting into vivid neons, each finish introduces an all-new aesthetic into your gaming setup</em>," the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">reveal post on the PlayStation Blog</a> reads. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HYPERPOP Collection | PS5 &amp; PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2eYfvciS_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three colours are called <strong>Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue.</strong> "<em></em><em>We’re cranking the volume all the way up with a collection that doesn’t just stand out, it takes over the room</em>," added <strong>Leo Cardoso</strong>, one of the members of Sony's design team who worked on the new collection. "<em>Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>A seamless gradient wraps around the front and back of the DualSense, finished in a high-gloss coat that makes the colors POP more than ever</em>," added <strong>Sae Kobayashi</strong>, another member of the design team. "<em></em><em>The console covers are also getting the same glow-up, featuring a subtle hint of transparency.</em>"</p>



<p>Again, it's nice to see PlayStation do more than just solid colours, though the switch to a glossy finish is quite concerning, particularly for the controllers. You may be able to install the face plates with gloves and leave them untouched, but the controllers will start getting ruined the moment you pick them up. Unless you start wearing thin gloves whenever you play your PS5.</p>



<p>The DualSense controllers and face plates will be available beginning on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> with the controllers listed at<strong> $84.99 USD/¥12,480 (including tax)/€84.99/£74.99</strong>, and the face plates listed at <strong>$74.99 USD/¥11,480(including tax)/€74.99/£64.99</strong>. </p>

			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>
