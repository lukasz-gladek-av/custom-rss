			<p>A limited Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition has been leaked in pictures<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1936165435164045812#m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> via X user Zuby_Tech</a> and might be very close to launch, at least <a href="https://www.gamesandwich.com/news/source-meta-will-announce-an-xbox-quest-3s-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Game Sandwich</a>, which reckons the branded VR device will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, June 24.</p>
<p>The report says the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will include a black and green headset with matching accessories, an Elite Strap, an Xbox wireless controller and a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Internally, it will have the same 128 GB standard system memory as the Meta Quest 3S. Pricing will be set at $399.</p>
<p>Meta officially&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-opens-up-quest-os-to-third-party-hardware-makers-asus-to-make-high-performance-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> its operating system to third-party hardware makers in April 2024. Back then, ASUS announced that it would craft a high-performance ROG VR headset, although we haven't received any further details. Alongside that announcement, Meta revealed it would release a limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been taking steps to bring Meta Quest users to the Xbox platform for a while. In late 2023, Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3-launches-on-october-10-with-asgards-wrath-2-bundled-xbox-cloud-gaming-coming-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became available on the VR headset</a>, allowing Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream games to their Meta Quest and experience them as if viewing a massive 2D screen. Games are streamed at 1080p (FullHD) resolution and 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>It's all part of Microsoft's grand plan to bring Xbox to virtually every device that has a screen and could run a game, including TVs, smartphones, and VR devices. Granted, it's unlikely that the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition could move the needle in any major way, but it is yet another in a series of initiatives that go in the same direction.</p>

			<p>FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, has just launched on PC and consoles. So far, users don't appear very happy with it - the game didn't even break 2K concurrent users <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=4777282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, and reviews are 'Mixed', with only 65% of users giving a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Remedy plans to improve the game in many ways, though. Update 1.2 just went live, focusing on making progression faster and more rewarding. Changes made to the economy improve how players earn and spend in-game currencies. The Requisition store now separates gear from cosmetics, and job progression has been restructured to enable players to access full Jobs (all three zones) more quickly.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning. The Finnish studio also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a more detailed letter acknowledging the game's shortcomings and providing an inkling of its following areas of focus for improvement.</p>
<p>Remedy admitted that the initial hours do not provide a great experience, partly due to a lack of proper onboarding and partly to a lack of clarity regarding what to do in the Jobs and how to do the work effectively. Additionally, the sense of power isnâ€™t great in the game's early stages, as starting (tier 1) weapons feel weak and unlocking higher-tier weapons requires excessive grinding.</p>
<p>However, the team reckons that players who stick around with FBC: Firebreak, unlock more powerful tier 3 weapons and perks, and play at higher threat levels and full three-zone job runs, are enjoying themselves more.</p>
<p>The game currently throws players in the middle of the action with little guidance on the game's systems, the player's actions in Jobs, and status effects. So, Remedy is looking at&nbsp;communicating the synergies between Crisis Kits more clearly and providing players with much better information on how to complete Jobs effectively.</p>
<p>This includes improving the readability of harmful conditions, such as being on fire, and the flashing blue effect, which indicates whether you have entered or exited the range of your crewmates to have Resonance and a shared shield. Objective markers are also unclear and do not provide sufficient guidance on what to do. Remedy is evaluating all this and has already gathered some ideas for improvement, but will need some time to plan and implement the changes properly.</p>
