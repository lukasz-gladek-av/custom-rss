			<p>CI Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted the first gameplay trailer of Lords of the Fallen II</a> at The Game Awards 2025, confirming the 2026 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned earlier this year</a>. </p>



<p>The trailer showcased some of the improvements confirmed for this sequel, including the introduction of a brand new dismemberment feature, which enables players to neutralize their opponents in a more decisive and expedient manner. This feature is complemented by the addition of novel executions, which further refine the combat experience. The press release also promised an even greater diversity of enemy types and boss battles of such remarkable intricacy that they will challenge even the most hardcore player, whether engaging in solo play, shared progression co-op, or optional PvP multiplayer.</p>



<p>However, there are also some philosophical changes in Lords of the Fallen II. CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski discussed those, as well as his more active role in the development of the sequel, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000284433052758033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Many of you asked why the game initially had body type A/B. Hexworks started early 2020 as an autonomous studio owned by CI Games. Early on, political correctness and filtering meant not every decision reached me on time. I got a lot more involved from late 2024 and now act as Head of Studio alongside my CEO role. Things are very different now and the studio got fully integrated. We reverted a lot of wrong decisions and will continue improving. Lords of the Fallen II is being built on real player feedback, and it’s crystal clear in the last two trailers.</em></p>



<p>Later in the X thread, a follower asked whether the game would feature attractive female characters and revealing armors, and the executive <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000294076826997103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied affirmatively</a>. In another response, he confirmed that enemy placement, one of the most common complaints levied against the predecessor, would be improved in the new title.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Lords of the Fallen II trailer, publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have also released a new update for Lords of the Fallen (2023). Enemies and bosses in particular received 'extensive behaviour updates' throughout the game, increasing the level of challenge. Several boss weapons also feature brand new signature attack animations. Lastly, Veteran Mode's bosses have been further empowered with faster transitions, highly aggressive behavior, and new attack patterns.</p>

			<p>Although it was only a CGI trailer featuring no gameplay, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the reveal of Larian Studios' Divinity</strong></a> was undoubtedly among the highlights of this year's The Game Awards, and for good reason, as the game is set to be even bigger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>It is not only the promise of a much bigger game that has got fans excited about Larian's next game. In true studio fashion, the reveal trailer held nothing back regarding dark and mature themes, and not to shock players, but to treat them with a level of intellectual respect, according to a studio representative.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on X, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Publishing director Michael Douse</a></strong> commented on the trailer's emphasis on dark themes, saying that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect"</em> came up a lot during planning. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It isn't about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The phrase "treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect" came up a lot in planning. It is about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This commitment to intellectual respect isn't surprising, considering how Larian has approached player agency in the past. Playing the "evil" or morally complex path in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong></a> is often designed to be just as interesting and nuanced as the selfless hero route. It is great to hear that the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't changed the studio's approach in creating three-dimensional worlds and stories that don't need to be sanitized to appeal to a wider range of players.</p>



<p>Divinity will mark Larian Studios' return to the franchise after Divinity: Original Sin 2, which launched in 2017 on PC and consoles. Despite the studio's long history with the franchise, the new game will mark <em>"the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before,"</em> and the <em>"Divinity we’ve always wanted to make,"</em> according to Larian CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Performance Improvements of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 Finally Address The Most Critical Issues]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, we have seen various performance improvements promised in patch notes, only to find that these improvements were so minor that they made no difference. Given <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">the long-standing performance issues in Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong>, there is obvious skepticism surrounding the <em>"over 100 performance improvements" </em>arriving <a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><strong>tomorrow with Title Update 4. </strong></a>Fortunately, fresh comparison videos released directly by CAPCOM confirm that these optimization steps are significant.</p>



<p>The two comparison videos, which can be watched below, compare performance between Title Update 3 and Title Update 4 in three fights against Arkveld, Xu Wu, and Lagiacrus on the recommended system configurations listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/"><strong>Steam</strong></a>:</p>



<p><strong>First Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>



<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *AMD FSR: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Second Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-10400</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (VRAM 8GB)</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *NVIDIA DLSS: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p>On both system configurations, all three scenarios see noticeable performance improvements. In the fight against Arkveld, the first configuration increases from an average of roughly 40 FPS in Title Update 3 to approximately 50 FPS in Title Update 4, with the second configuration experiencing similar performance improvements. Although the improvements in average FPS are promising already, performance stability also seems to have been improved, which should make the experience more enjoyable for all PC players.</p>

<p>The performance improvements of Title Update 4 are only the beginning, as Monster Hunter Wilds is set to get more enhancements in January and February, when the game's final Title Update will launch on all formats, coinciding with the game's first anniversary.  Hopefully, all the performance improvements and additional content will be enough for lapsed players to return, which is something <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>the producer wishes for</strong></a> and the game definitely deserves, as I highlighted in my launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a></strong>.</p>
