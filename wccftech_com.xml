			<p>Ubisoft announced it has acquired the MOBA game March of Giants from Amazon, with the Montreal-based team becoming a part of Ubisoft when the deal closes on its expected date of December 16, 2025. Though the MOBA will be officially owned by Ubisoft, as part of the deal, Amazon will still provide marketing support for the game on Twitch.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release, where Ubisoft says it "<em>sees March of Giants as an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game</em>."</p>



<p>The March of Giants team is led by creative director Xavier Marquis and senior production leader Alexandre Parizeau, two developers who have previously worked at Ubisoft in their careers. Marquis was the original creative director of Rainbow Six Siege, and Parizeau was the former managing director of the Ubisoft Toronto studio.</p>

<p>"<em>Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle</em>," Marquis said in a press release. "<em>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level</em>."</p>



<p>Parizeau added, "<em>My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs</em>."</p>



<p>For Amazon's part, Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch, and games at Amazon, added, "<em>We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants. We're confident that under Ubisoft's leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences</em>."</p>



<p>This acquisition comes shortly after Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">laid off 14,000+ workers this past October</a>, with a significant portion of those cuts impacting the teams at Amazon Game Studios. As a result of the cuts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">New World: Aeternum's development was shuttered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">an MMO Lord of the Rings game was cancelled for a second time</a>. </p>



<p>Though Amazon recently revealed two upcoming Tomb Raider games at The Game Awards, this sale to Ubisoft is the latest sign of the company narrowing its focus in the video game industry and seemingly prioritizing game development only with established IPs and adaptations of video games, since the company doesn't seem inclined to slow down production on adaptations like<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/"> Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>



<p>That said, Amazon's loss seems like a win for Ubisoft. Regarding the acquisition, chief executive officer Yves Guillemot said, "<em>March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP</em>."</p>

			<p>GSC Game World is expanding STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl with new free content tomorrow on all platforms, as revealed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the PlayStation Blog</a> by the Ukrainian studio. Players can look forward to the following additions:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 quests that can take hours to complete</li>



<li>7 locations to explore</li>



<li>6 characters with their own backgrounds and stories</li>



<li>A unique weapon</li>



<li>A hub to create</li>
</ul>



<p>This new questline begins, as is often the case in STALKER 2 missions, with strange occurrences near the Malachite in the west of the map. Research groups sent by scientists reported a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. Stalkers who listened to it suffered from headaches, nosebleeds, and even hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed all of this first-hand. Although he was good at scientific research, he did not know enough about radio signals to figure out what was happening. This is where Banzai, a radio enthusiast who also joined the investigation, steps in. However, something must have gone wrong.</p>



<p>After logging into STALKER 2 once the patch has gone live, players will be able to hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Should they choose to investigate, the developers recommend paying close attention to the Red Forest region on the map. Ultimately, it will be up to their intuition, rationality, and choices to reveal how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the bullet point list, those who have already finished the game will find that some familiar locations are now resettled by fellow Stalkers. The locations include Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p>



<p>The new weapon is the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players. It includes a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope, and its trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p>



<p>Lastly, depending on the choices made in the new questline, STALKER 2 players can also unlock a new hub in the Burnt Forest region. Players can look forward to amenities such as the technician, trader, medic, and guide NPCs, a bed to rest, and access to their stash.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> GSC Game World about the PlayStation 5 launch that took place last month. Among other things, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got confirmation</a> that the first official DLC will launch next year. On the other hand, there's no news yet on the multiplayer mode promised before the original release.</p>
