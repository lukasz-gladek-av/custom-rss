			<p>Valve has issued a cease and desist order to the team behind the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mod, Classic Offensive, after having previously approved the mod 8 years prior.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement published to the mod team's official <a href="https://x.com/csco_dev/status/1920189873488642332">X</a> account, the Classic Offensive team warns mod creators that they "<em>should reconsider how they see Valve: a company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.</em>"</p>
<p>Valve gave the project the green light in 2017, according to a <a href="https://classic-offensive.net/#/timeline">timeline</a> the Classic Offensive mod team has created on their website. After years of little to no communication from Valve, in January 2025, the Classic Offensive app was rejected by Valve with the only explanation being "<em>we found that your app is not a good fit for Steam</em>."</p>
<p>After that, the team worked to try and find out what Valve meant by Classic Offensive not being a good fit, reaching out to Valve to no avail. The cease and desist order came through just hours before the team intended to update the mod through ModDB.</p>
<p>"<em>As we prepared to update via ModDB instead,</em>" the Classic Offensive team's statement reads, "<em>we received a cease and desist notification from Valve's socials just hours before launch. In follow-up communications, they clarified that releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on their intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The statement goes on to call out the narrowing conditions for what mods based on Valve's games are allowed and how, in the view of the Classic Offensive team, the company's current interpretations of what's allowed go against the culture around modding that Valve has benefited from for years and Valve's approval of the project in 2017.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for the mod team and those who were looking forward to Classic Offensive that Valve has seemingly changed its mind about what it wants to allow at the last minute, and it also puts into question other mods, particularly the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cs-legacy-a-fan-made-standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-is-in-the-works/">CS: GO Legacy project</a>.</p>

			<p>The Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes that can be downloaded online don't bring any significant improvement, a recent analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at some of the mods available for the remaster of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, starting with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion BSA Uncompressor</a>. The mod, which showed promise because it eliminated a CPU task, was developed for the original Oblivion, but it also works in the remaster, as it ships with the original Oblivion assets. The installation procedure isn't very simple, requiring the user to manually uncompress files as well, but the efforts should be worth it, as it's been claimed it does improve performance.</p>
<p>However, all the effort required to install this mod isn't really worth it for Oblivion Remastered. In their test, Digital Foundry highlighted how, while there's a minimal variance at the beginning of a session, the differences eventually become equal. The difference between the five-minute-long benchmark runs set around the Imperial City was less than 2%, and it doesn't eliminate the issue, as it doesn't address the variance that makes the experience feel choppy.</p>
<p>Besides checking out if the Oblivion BSA Uncompressor indeed solves stuttering issues in Oblivion Remastered, the tech experts also looked at the many engine configuration tweaked files that are usually shared after an Unreal Engine game launches. Looking at the most popular tweaked engine configuration file available from Nexus Mods, the tech experts highlighted how many of the changes don't actually mean anything for a shipped game, such as turning off logging, and how the tweaked file effectly does nothing for performance.</p>

<p>With Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes not really doing anything, it will be up to Virtuos to fix the game's performance, which is one of the biggest issues of the remaster.

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country will challenge rising game prices with an unexpectedly low price tag when it launches in three months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series developed by Hangar 13 will <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/mafia-the-old-country-launching-august-8-2025-debuts-official-gameplay-trailer-and-developer-insights-video">launch</a>, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/">rumored</a>, on August 8th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's Standard Edition, as mentioned above, will challenge the trend of rising prices by launching for only $49.99. The Deluxe Edition, which will include a variety of bonus items - the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories, and the Gatto Nero Pack featuring the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car - as well as digital bonus materials like a digital artbook and original score, will also be reasonably priced at $59.99. The pre-order bonus Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories, and "Lupara" Charm will be available for both editions of the game.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the official release date for Mafia: The Old Country, publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOIg2lFVsJE">a new trailer</a> for the game, which provides a good look at the gameplay, which does away with the open-world mechanics of previous entries in the series in favor of a more linear, story-driven experience. The developers will provide more information on the game later today during a PAX East panel. Once available, both the trailer and the panel can be watched below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass">The Game Business</a> looked back on how Microsoft's decision to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on Xbox Game Pass panned out, and the results are, well, mixed. On the one hand, the decision does seem to have paid off for Xbox overall. On the other hand, it doesn't look like it really did anything for Call of Duty as a game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched, according to player numbers that The Game Business pulled from Ampere Analysis, 33.7 million people were playing Black Ops 6. That's a big, 13 million increase on the previous year's abysmal Modern Warfare 3, and a smaller, but still significant 2.5 million increase from the last strong Call of Duty release with 2022's Modern Warfare 2.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 drove a large spike in Game Pass subscriptions, it had more people playing Call of Duty on Xbox devices and platforms, and even though PlayStation's market share still towers over Xbox's, Call of Duty coming to Game Pass was able to keep team green in the game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and the spike in Game Pass subscribers Call of Duty brought in has definitely helped the service, with an 11% increase in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024's first quarter, according to Circana. Players stuck around to enjoy the rest of what Game Pass has to offer, which is better for Microsoft and the entire Xbox ecosystem.</p>
<p>Those same players who joined Game Pass to play Call of Duty have seemingly not kept playing Call of Duty. The number of players on Call of Duty who were playing on Xbox when Black Ops 6 launched dropped 10%, and the Call of Duty player base has seen a sharp decline compared to the decrease following the launch of previous Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is still a massive game with over 20 million active players, but that player base is currently 20.6 million, according to Ampere Analysis, which sits slightly below the 20.8 million it was back in 2023.</p>
<p>More players than the series' last major release were playing Black Ops 6 when it launched, and months later, Call of Duty has fewer active players than it did two years prior. Adding Call of Duty to Game Pass helped Xbox boost subscribers, but hasn't helped its marquee series substantially grow.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is an Xbox first-party title, so what's good for Xbox is theoretically good for Call of Duty. But Call of Duty is arguably Xbox's most important series now, and it's not exactly the best sign for Xbox that adding its most important series to its core subscription service only helped one of those things grow.</p>
