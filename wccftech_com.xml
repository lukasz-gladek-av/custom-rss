			<p>Just a few days <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the original rumor</a>, Electronic Arts (EA) confirmed yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it is indeed getting a $55 billion buyout</a> from a Consortium of investors that includes PIF, Saudi Arabia's sovereign investment fund, Silver Lake (an American global private equity firm), and Affinity Partners, an American investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of current United States president Donald Trump.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has started to settle, though, the first reports from reputable sources suggest that there might be massive layoffs on the way at EA, and it's not just history suggesting that after what happened with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. According to a paywalled report <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the Financial Times</a>, the investors from the aforementioned Consortium are planning to use the latest AI advancements to cut EA's operating costs and manage its substantial debt, suggesting a potential shift towards incorporating AI in games and therefore reducing manpower, both when it comes to development teams and acting talent.</p>



<p>Speaking about that debt, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg's report</a> reveals that this deal is partly funded by $20 billion in debt sourced by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This is the most significant debt commitment ever registered for a buyout. Moreover, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonschreier_ea-agrees-to-55-billion-sale-in-largest-activity-7378438808637243392-QqT5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a LinkedIn post from Bloomberg's Schreier</a>, they will be put on the books of EA:</p>



<p><em>That will mean a significant amount of cost-cutting. I would expect mass layoffs, more aggressive monetization, and many other measures. The interest alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per year. For context: this is nearly four times as much debt as the Toys R Us LBO, and I think everyone knows how that went.</em></p>



<p>This is very worrying, especially for EA employees. One studio that might be targeted in case of mandated cost-cutting measures is BioWare, which did not deliver a financially successful game with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Canadian developer already suffered some layoffs and, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had fewer than a hundred employees left</a>. Hopefully, they will get one last chance with the next Mass Effect game.</p>



<p>Former CEO and co-founder of analyst firm SuperData, Joost van Dreunen, also chimed in on the massive $55 billion deal, the second biggest in gaming history (after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard) and the biggest buyout of all time, topping the $48.4 billion buyout of TXU Energy in 2007. <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his SuperJoost Playlist Substack newsletter</a>, the games analyst focused specifically on PIF. The Saudi Arabian private investment fund already owned roughly 10% of EA's shares, which made their part of the transaction less onerous. Even so, the analyst says their strategy is to 'throw staggering amounts of money at establishing market dominance', and given that they have nearly infinite investment resources, it may well succeed. </p>



<p>Van Dreunen also posits that private companies are generally better insulated than public companies when it comes to market pressure, so the new owners of Electronic Arts could technically forego short-term profits in favor of the long-term view. However, PIF is not the only one in the Consortium - Silver Lake and Affinity Partners may hold a different mindset.</p>

			<p>When CAPCOM announced that Resident Evil Requiem would also be released on the Nintendo Switch 2, several fans expressed doubts about how the game would run on the console, which is notoriously less powerful than all its current generation counterparts. However, some off-screen footage from last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game running quite smoothly</a> on Nintendo's latest gaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Japanese website Famitsu</a> during the Japanese gaming convention, CAPCOM's Game Director Koshi Nakanishi admitted that even the developers were surprised at first to see Resident Evil Requiem running that well on Nintendo Switch 2. Nakanishi credited much of the result to the RE Engine.</p>



<p><em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly. We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, elsewhere in the Famitsu interview, Game Producer Masato Kumazawa said that the TGS 2025 demo stations offered Nintendo Switch 2 and laptop PCs as options. Indeed, if Resident Evil Requiem runs smoothly on the Nintendo Switch 2, we expect it to do the same on a wide range of computers, though CAPCOM hasn't shared the official PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We do know that the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC</a>. Presumably, other upscalers will be supported as well, like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Intel XeSS, but they haven't been officially confirmed yet.</p>

			<p>Techland's latest mainline installment in its Dying Light series, Dying Light: The Beast, is finally here, and players can leap into the infected-ridden resort town and forest area of Castor Woods with returning protagonist Kyle Crane back at the helm.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and it was my first time diving into the series, which means that everything that was old hat for series veterans was brand new to me.</p>



<p>It also means there were a few things I would've appreciated knowing about Dying Light: The Beast before jumping in, which is why this guide will aim to give you five things to know about diving into Techland's latest zombie-riddled adventure.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-starter-guide-5-things-to-know-about-leaping-into-castor-woods">Dying Light: The Beast Starter Guide - 5 Things to Know About Leaping Into Castor Woods</h2>



<h3 id="h-don-t-go-out-at-night-at-least-not-right-away">Don't go out at night - at least not right away</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>A key part of the Dying Light series is its day-and-night cycle, and the terrors that you can face when the sun goes down, compared to when it's high in the sky. Going out at night is a core part of the Dying Light experience, and the tense moments you experience while being chased by one or multiple Volatile's on your way to a safe zone are where some of the best gameplay moments come from.</p>



<p>But they can also be the source of the most frustrating, if you're not prepared. That's why once you've reached the Town Hall and you're let loose in Old Town in Castor Woods, do yourself a favour and spend some time avoiding the night. Take advantage of not having to deal with Volatile's during the day and unlock the safe zones in Old Town before you start exploring the area at night.</p>



<p>Getting killed by Volatile's and losing a bunch of XP early on while you're trying to level up and gain some key skills, like being able to jump kick zombies isn't how you want to spend your early hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-craft-your-bow-and-keep-it-upgraded">Craft your bow and keep it upgraded</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first ranged weapon you'll get in the game is the Hunting Bow, and getting it crafted and in your inventory is something you'll want to do as soon as possible. It'll be on the first workbench you find in the game, which is Techland basically signposting it to you as something to get in your inventory right away, but you probably won't have the materials for it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's an easy fix, as the required materials aren't too difficult to scavenge. Once you have it in your inventory, it's also worth keeping it upgraded as much as possible. Particularly when you're taking on human enemies throughout the game, your bow is key to ensuring stealth-focused scenarios go well.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-bandage-flashlight-and-throwing-knife-blueprints">Upgrade your bandage, flashlight, and throwing knife blueprints</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll be upgrading your gear and swapping out weapons over the course of Dying Light: The Beast, but the upgrades you'll want to really prioritize are your blueprint upgrades. Specifically the blueprints for your bandages, UV flashlight, and throwing knives.</p>



<p>Upgrading the blueprints for each item makes them more effective, and in the case of throwing knives, lets you craft more of them without using as many resources.</p>



<p>These three items are the ones you will likely use more than any other during your time in Castor Woods, and upgrading their blueprints as quickly as you can will have you set up for the endgame well before you get there.</p>



<h3 id="h-mash-that-survivor-sense-at-all-times">Mash that Survivor Sense at all times</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Areas like this can look devoid of resources, until your Survivor Sense reveals otherwise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Survivor Sense ability can be occasionally helpful for keeping track of enemies nearby, human and zombie alike, but what it's really key for is telling you where resources are near you. You'll want to keep mashing the survivor sense as much as you can, because you're otherwise liable to miss scores of resources that you'll need for upgrading your gear and for crafting the resources you need while out in the wilds of Castor Woods.</p>



<h3 id="h-you-don-t-need-to-fight-everyone-and-everything">You don't need to fight everyone and everything</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>Particularly, if you're like me, you might feel like you need to wipe every zombie you see off the board when you see them. Absolutely not the case - it's good to keep your aggression meter up so that you can launch into Beast mode quickly when you do get into a big fight, so picking off a few zombies here and there isn't a bad idea.</p>



<p>But you absolutely don't need to fight every zombie you come across, and you're better off not trying to. Besides the fact that your weapons will deteriorate faster, you'll more than likely find yourself getting overwhelmed with all the noise you're making, and then you're back in the position of losing XP for no good reason.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you're a Dying Light veteran, than most of this was probably old hat for you, but if you were like me and are playing The Beast without having checked out the previous games, than these tips will help you start off your journey through Castor Woods on the right foot.</p>
