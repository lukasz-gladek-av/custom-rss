			<p>The rumored new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> Digital Edition hardware revision, featuring a smaller SSD than the current models, is real and likely to launch very soon in Europe, judging from recent developments.</p>



<p>The CFI-2100 hardware revision leaked earlier this month, identical to the current Digital Edition save for the installed 825 GB SSD in place of the current 1 TB drive, is now listed on <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Playstation-CFI-2100-Playstation%C2%AE5-Edizione-Digitale/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">France</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Germany</a>. While the system is out of stock on Amazon France, it can be purchased from Amazon Italy and Germany, although with a delivery date ranging from October 23 in Germany and between November 11 and March 31, 2026 in Italy, suggesting that it has yet to officially launch.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, a very reliable leaker revealed that the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">PlayStation 5 Digital Edition CFI-2100 hardware revision was close to release in Europe</a> earlier this month. However, the new system was initially discovered a few months earlier thanks to certification documents filed in Japan, which detailed how the latest revision had been created to optimize production costs, which is achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than every other PS5 Digital Edition released to date, among other things. Considering the CFI-2100 is launching at the same price as the older versions of the systems sporting a 1TB SSD, it would be a good idea for anyone looking into purchasing a PlayStation 5 in the near future to get any of the older versions of the Digital Edition while they are still available.</p>



<p>Besides launching new Playstation 5 hardware revision, Sony is also continuing to improve the system's firmware. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">A new update is rolling out today</a>, introducing new features such as a new DualSense pairing option which allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices at the same, and a Power Saver mode.</p>

			<p>We know that RGG Studio is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> and a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter</a> title, and it's a fair assumption that there's a new Like a Dragon game on the horizon. As far as what else the studio might be working on, we have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/">RGG Summit </a>to look forward to next week, but it seems like someone at SEGA or RGG Studio jumped the gun, accidentally revealing the next Yakuza game, as the RGG website showed a brief mention of Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>



<p>The mention was spotted on the <a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">studio's official site</a> and posted to <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605">X (formerly Twitter)</a> before being shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/">Reddit</a>, and though it was quickly taken down, it remained cached in Google, and could be seen by searching "龍が如く 極 3" site:http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are both remakes of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, so it follows that Yakuza Kiwami 3 would be a remake of Yakuza 3. If this slip-up is indeed real, then on top of expecting more looks at Stranger Than Heaven, Virtua Fighter, and the next Like a Dragon game, we can add an official Kiwami 3 reveal to the list for next week's RGG Summit and Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Last year, RGG Studio's series director for Yakuza, Masayoshi Yokoyama, hinted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-entry-auditions-kiwami-3-not-next-someday/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 might happen "<em>someday</em>."</a> It seems like 'someday' is coming sooner than we might've thought.</p>
