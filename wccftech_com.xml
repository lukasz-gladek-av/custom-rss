			<p>If you're getting stuck into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard and want to know who you can romance ahead of time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know. In total, there are six characters you can romance, and a lot of the time, being able to bump up your relationship with them involves completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/">certain quests</a>, picking specific dialog options, and the like. It functions the same way it does in most games, where you can romance a companion. This guide will tell you about each character you can romance and some of the best ways to win their favor.</p>
<h2>All Romance Options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As stated above, there are&nbsp;<strong>six characters</strong> that you can romance. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harding</li>
<li>Neve</li>
<li>Bellara</li>
<li>Davrin</li>
<li>Emmrich</li>
<li>Taash</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to romance the characters, you'll want to make sure that you are checking the&nbsp;<strong>Lighthouse</strong> frequently. This is a hub that shows which characters you can interact with, and this will give you an opportunity to have conversations with them, which can also lead to progress in your bond with them. As you progress your relationship with the companion, you'll also be given the option to take on their personal quests. If you complete them, it also has the option to provide additional context and conversations where you are able to flirt with them.</p>
<p>Should you be undecided on who to romance, you are given the option to flirt with all of the companions for a time until you reach a point in a relationship with one of them where they ask for commitment. Then, it's up to you to decide your next move.</p>
<p>In addition to having conversations with the companions, completing any quest will boost your relationship with the companions that are in your party. If you're trying to romance someone specific, it's generally recommended that you keep them in your party throughout the game to be able to boost their relationship as you go. While quests provide approval boosts with your companions, completing faction-specific quests can also grant approval boosts to the companions in those specific factions.</p>
<p>As an example, if you're fighting off Venatori enemies in Dock Town, this will increase your relationship with Neve but will not increase your relationship with the other companions available.</p>
<p>It's also possible for specific companions to romance each other. It's uncertain at the moment whether it's based on who you pick or if it's just guaranteed to end up that way, but there is the possibility of seeing some of your friends romance each other.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about all of the romance options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Who will you be romancing first?</p>

			<p>Two days ago, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the closure of two PlayStation Studios: Firewalk, maker of Concord (reported to have cost over $200 million and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> mere days after its launch), and Neon Koi, which would have attempted to bring some of Sony's prized IPs to mobile.</p>
<p>Now, the CWA (Communications Workers of America) has released a rather scathing statement accusing Sony of furthering its gaming monopoly with the layoffs. They also plan to share their concerns with antitrust regulators. Here's the relevant excerpt from the statement:</p>
<p><em>This devastating news comes on the heels of record layoffs across the video game industry. These decisions by highly insulated video game CEOs are creating perilous working conditions for video game workers by eliminating their job stability. Last month, former Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President Chris Deering suggested that laid-off game workers should “go to the beach for a year,” further demonstrating the lack of respect executives have for their workforce amid layoffs.</em></p>
<p><em>Alongside these layoffs, Sony’s decision to dissolve studios outside their walled garden of PlayStation-exclusive content rather than making games that have to compete in the highly diverse and competitive mobile game market should be a cautionary warning sign of Sony’s interest in furthering its monopoly position in the video game industry. CWA plans to raise the anti-competitive impacts of Sony’s increasing monopoly and monopsony power with the appropriate antitrust regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders.</em></p>
<p>The CWA previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a labor neutrality agreement with Microsoft and favorably <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-x-microsoft-deal-backed-by-cwa-in-ftc-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hailed</a> the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (which, however, came with its own heavy cost in layoffs).</p>
<p>Sony is about to launch a new console, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, on the market. We've recently interviewed two game developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Five</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>) to hear their impressions on the hardware.</p>
<p>Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Hideaki Nishino, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Studio Business Group. In the conversation, Nishino discussed Sony's vision for the PS5 Pro:</p>
<p><em>We have done Pro in the last generation. We learned a lot from there. When we were selling PS4 Pro, in addition to the PS4, 20% of customers actually got the PS4 Pro. It was high-end, premium tier. There are potential users acquiring those kind of units. Interestingly enough, it was not just about highly engaged users; actually, new users came to PlayStation to get PS4 Pro as well.</em></p>
<p><em>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launched — it was another five-year project for us. There was a conversation around whether we wanted to do another Pro or not. But the main thing was, there are technologies we can grow up in three years or five years. The innovation and technology advancement is quicker in the modern world. Phones are updating every year, PCs are updating every year. I don’t think we’d go every year updates, but there are things we can package together to bring the greatest things into game console segment range. That’s the vision.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7 for $699/£699/€799.</p>
