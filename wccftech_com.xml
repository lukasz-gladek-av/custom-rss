			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to feature a 60 FPS mode, despite indications found in recent footage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of their weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the new game footage that was featured in a recent Creator's Voice video, comparing it to footage captured on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, highlighting the differences between the two versions of the game. Despite a blurrier image, heavier dithering on hair, and shallower depth of field, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game holds up quite well.</p>
<p>What Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to offer on Nintendo Switch 2, as opposed to PlayStation 5, is a 60 FPS mode. In the Creator's Voice video, the iconic scene with Cloud jumping off the train right before beginning the mission to destroy Reactor No.1 runs at 60 FPS, which suggested the Nintendo Switch 2 version would offer a 60 FPS option, but in their analysis, Digital Foundry highlighted how the quality of Cloud's hair in the shot is even higher than in the same sequence on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, so the footage was not taken from the Switch 2 version, but likely from the PC version.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Creator's Voice video, Final Fantasy VII Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">hinted</a> that the entire remake trilogy could be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this intention could suggest that the yet-to-be-announced third part of the trilogy may not make the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> as, while the engine could solve some of the visual issues we have seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we currently have no indication that the engine can run well on the system, or that visuals could be cut down significantly to make the game run on the system and still look reasonably good.&nbsp; With the developer's desire to have part 3 out as soon as possible, which would be difficult to accomplish with an engine change, this statement could have provided an indication of the next game's technical direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-director-is-working-really-hard-to-make-it-great-game-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Quest XII has been missing in action for a long time. Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-development-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new installment in the revered Japanese roleplaying game series in early 2020. In May 2021, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-is-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-story-is-already-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology would power it and that the story was already finished. A few months later, it was discovered that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate would be co-developed by Orca, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, however, there have been no further news or even leaks about this game. At Comic-Con Napoli, franchise creator Yuji Horii finally broke the silence <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, revealing that he and the team are 'working really hard' to make the game great.</p>
<p><em>Yes, indeed, I can't say anything, I apologise. I am making it, putting lots of work into it. I can only say that the next work will be great too, working really hard. Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say.</em></p>
<p>He also appeared to hint that Dragon Quest XII could be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a>.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well.</em></p>
<p>However, we shouldn't take that as an actual announcement, not only because it would come from Square Enix, but also because Horii has already kind of fallen into a bit of a translation issue at Comic-Con Napoli where it was reported that he had practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a Chrono Trigger remake. In contrast, he had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed interest</a> in such a project.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the creator of Dragon Quest also expressed his thoughts on the genre as a whole, although he did not comment on the recent success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><em>The characteristic of an RPG is its story, I believe, not an open world, but you can enjoy its story. In a way, RPGs are for hardcore players. Depending on how you make the story, it makes it easy to play. While enjoying the story, you also become stronger. So I think RPGs enable you to enjoy these two elements.</em></p>

			<p>Some of the issues found in the PC version of DOOM: The Dark Ages will require a driver fix, and thus won't be fixed with any patch that may launch once the game releases to the public later this week.</p>
<p>Following the game's early access release for all who pre-ordered it, developer id Software shared a new FAQ, including a list of known issues on all platforms. The list of PC issues is rather substantial, and includes issues like crashing issues when playing on an RTX 50 series GPU with G-Sync or V-Sync enabled and Multi Frame Generation, game locking issues when resizing the window manually while using AMD FSR frame generation, game launching in the background if alt-tabbing on an NVIDIA GPU, OBS capturing issues and others. Some of these issues, as mentioned above, require some driver fixes and may take some more time to get fixed.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of DOOM: The Dark Ages known PC issues and their fixes or workarounds below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 50 series GPU and enable G-Sync (supported display required) or V-Sync plus Multi Frame Generation through NVIDIA Control Panel you can crash the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until a driver fix is available, the workaround for this issue is to either disable one of these options in the NVIDIA control panel or if you want both enabled, set them in-game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 40 or 50 series GPU and enable Multi Frame Generation or FrameGen, V-Sync still shows as enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a minor cosmetic issue – the game disables V-Sync under the hood in these cases.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA GPUs may find that Alt-Tabbing while launching the game can cause the game to launch in the background and not be accessible.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a known driver issue. Until a fix is available in a driver update, to avert this issue, avoid Alt-Tabbing during game launch. If encountered, it can be resolved by restarting your PC.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA 50 series GPUs may experience TDRs or system hangs when starting gameplay recording using Shadowplay with MultiFrameGen set to 3x or 4x.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, either do not use the noted MFG settings or record gameplay with a different application.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If capturing with OBS, game visuals may freeze when Alt-tabbing from Fullscreen</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until there is an update from OBS, the workaround for the issue is to capture in Windowed or Borderless mode.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: The game can lock up when manually resizing the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not manually resize the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users who unplug a 2nd monitor during gameplay may notice that the game has frozen.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not unplug any monitors while playing the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Players running the game with the MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner overlays enabled may experience stability issues.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not run the game with either application running in the background.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: In rare cases, players running DOOM: The Dark Ages on a supported PC spec at appropriate settings, who have the latest GPU drivers installed and also have an intel CPU model number that starts with the number 13 or 14 can run into persistent crashing.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: In such cases, you may have a corrupted CPU. Please contact intel Customer Support at&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fcontact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages also has some known issues on consoles as well. Some of these issues are already being investigated and will potentially be fixed in future updates. You can find the full list <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/509579946274851061">here</a>.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S for all those who pre-ordered the game. It will become available for everyone else on May 15th.
