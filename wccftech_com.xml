            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A short video clip from the single-player campaign for the next mainline entry in the Battlefield series has been pulled from the files of the latest Battlefield Labs update, with dataminer <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">Temporyal discovering and posting the clip to X</a>.</p>
<p>The footage is clearly still a work-in-progress which Temporyal points out, and they also clarify that this is not a clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/">gameplay from a playtest</a> or the<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-showcased-in-new-leaked-video/"> Battlefield Labs test</a> like we've seen with other leaks, but just a video file, which also explains why the footage lacks the watermarks that usually accompany your screen if you've ever participated in a closed playtest.</p>
<p>According to Temporyal, the clip "<em>shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan</em>." Temporyal <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">also reveals that, based on their findings</a>, the campaign will be eight missions long, nine including a prologue, taking players to locations like Tajikistan, Egypt, the USA, and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release for the next Battlefield game, and we don't even know what it's officially called. According to EA, we should know at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">one of those two things soon</a>, with a summer reveal currently set to happen at some unknown point in time from now until September, to be generous.</p>
<p>For all we've seen of the next Battlefield game through leaked footage like this, there's still a lot to be revealed. These leaks are useful to get a sense of what's to come, but they're never the full picture, and there's a lot riding on this next Battlefield game. It's no secret that EA is in need of a big win.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA canceled its Black Panther game,</a> shutting down the studio it had created to make that specific game and laying everyone off. It canceled another incubation project at Respawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off more staff across Respawn</a> and other parts of the company. And at the beginning of the year, EA<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> laid off developers at BioWare</a> following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and its disappointing sales, which reached only half of what EA's top brass had expected.</p>
<p>A report recently dug into everything that happened with The Veilguard's development, and how mismanagement by those <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">same leaders at EA plagued the game from the beginning of its development journey</a>.</p>
<p>Add all the layoffs, internal issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">the sunsetting of hybrid work and a return-to-office call</a>, and game cancellations together, and add to that the fact that the latest entry in the company's biggest sports series <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/electronic-arts-says-dragon-age-and-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-as-it-revises-its-financial-outlook-downward/">underperformed last year</a>, and it doesn't paint a picture of a company that's all flowers and rainbows.</p>
<p>EA needs Battlefield to do well to potentially be a turning point for the company. When the full reveal comes this summer, depending on players reactions to the game, we'll see which way things are beginning to turn.</p>

			<p>A new Lies of P patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing bug fixes as well as some major changes that make it easier to access the Overture DLC from the second playthrough.</p>
<p>The 1.9.0.0 patch changes how the Overture DLC is accessed from the second playthrough. Instead of essentially having to play through the vast majority of the game again, players can now access the DLC campaign from Chapter 5 at the "Path of the Pilgrim." The patch also introduces some difficulty changes, reducing monster difficulty in repeat playthroughs and adjusting stats for certain regular monsters in the first playthrough of the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Besides making these changes, the Lies of P new patch addresses a variety of bugs, including issues that prevented benefit items from being properly delivered, some progression blockers, and more. The full patch notes can be found<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776?l=english"> here.</a></p>
<p>The difficulty changes introduced by the Lies of P 1.9.0.0 patch are personally quite welcome, as I found the difficulty of regular enemies a bit overtuned during my first playthrough of the Overture DLC. Thankfully, it was easy to look past balancing issues, as the expansion is just as good as the main campaign, if not even more, for those interested in the game's setting and lore who wanted to learn more about it, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p>Lies of P is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>
