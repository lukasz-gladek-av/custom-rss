			<p><strong>Hello Games</strong> has just released <strong>Remnant</strong>, another free update for <strong>No Man's Sky</strong>. The patch (6.2) introduces gravity manipulation mechanics, extensive vehicle customization, and industrial waste processing facilities.</p>



<p>The headline feature of Remnant is arguably the <strong>Gravitino Coi</strong>l, a new Multi-Tool upgrade <strong>that fundamentally changes how players interact with the game world</strong>. This device allows travelers to magnetize, carry, and launch objects, creating entirely new gameplay possibilities through physics manipulation.</p>



<p><strong>No Man's Sky players are now able to grab and fling various items scattered across planets</strong>, including golden artifacts discovered in planetary ruins. However, the developers believe the tool's most creative application is actually in combat, where <strong>it enables players to capture and throw Sentinel Drones</strong>, effectively turning enemies into projectile weapons against each other, which sounds very fun indeed. Additionally, combat supplies dropped by defeated enemies can now be consumed directly, and the Gravitino Coil interacts with Sphere Creator objects that players have placed in their bases.</p>



<p>The patch introduces <strong>extensive customization options to the off-road Colossus vehicle</strong>. Players can now equip custom modules and technologies, including superelastic wheels, tracked treads, and specialized off-road gear designed to handle any terrain type. Visual customization has also expanded with new paint finishes that can be layered alongside traditional color choices. However, <strong>the most striking addition is the Mechanical Legs upgrade: arachnid-like spider legs that provide hydraulic crawling</strong>. No Man's Sky players can earn the Mechanical Legs by completing the new Remnant expedition, which <strong>features a cross-country hauling experience</strong> where players register for waste transportation missions. </p>



<p><strong>New industrial facilities have appeared in scrap worlds</strong>, offering players the opportunity to extract materials and earn rewards by collecting waste. The system revolves around gathering radioactive crates, explosive canisters, and toxic barrels, though all of them require careful handling due to their hazardous nature. Specialized processing units enable the safe containment and disposal of these dangerous materials, turning environmental cleanup into a potentially profitable venture. </p>



<p>Beyond gameplay additions, cloud rendering has seen significant technical improvements, including enhanced lighting, improved edge stability, and performance optimizations. These changes are particularly noticeable during dawn and dusk sequences.</p>

<p>Hello Games is very excited about what's coming this year, especially since <strong>it marks the tenth anniversary of No Man's Sky's original launch</strong>. The game stumbled at first, as we all know, but recovered miraculously well. At this point, every update (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-adds-expedition-encourages-players-spacewalk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they come in every two to three months</a>) is just gravy.</p>

			<p>For the second year in a row, <strong>Xbox</strong> has revealed the games awarded with its signature stamp of excellence in the <strong>Xbox Excellence Awards</strong>. The awards list 20 titles in four categories, though several of them are repeats, which means only <strong>55</strong> individual titles have made the cut this year. Of those 55, included are titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, Battlefield 6, Helldivers 2, </strong>and <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong,</strong> all of which made the cut as some of the best-selling games on the Xbox platform in 2025.</p>



<p>The games are listed alphabetically in the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/11/xbox-excellence-awards-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the winners, so we don't know which title actually ranked first in any of the categories, which are: Store Rating, Player Engagement, Daily Active Users, and Units Sold.</p>



<p>Interestingly, no individual title made it in all four categories. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> and <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> were the only titles to make three out of four lists, with any other repeats only making it on two out of four lists. While Borderlands 4 missed out on the Store Rating list, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 missed out on the Player Engagement list.</p>



<p>On the Units Sold list, other notable inclusions besides the aforementioned titles are Borderlands 4, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</strong> You can check out the full chart below.</p>

			<p>We have another film adaptation of a video game to look forward to, and it's once again another <strong>PlayStation</strong> franchise to add to the list of adaptations under the belt of <strong>Sony </strong>and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>. This time, it's <strong>Fast &amp; Furious</strong> director <strong>Justin Lin</strong> taking on an adaptation of <strong>Arrowhead Games' Helldivers</strong>, with Dune's Duncan Idaho, <strong>Jason Momoa,</strong> starring in the film.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, which adds that the film will premiere next year, on <strong>November 10, 2027,</strong> with Lin's <strong>Perfect Storm Entertainment</strong> and PlayStation Productions producing the film.</p>



<p>Other adaptations, whether they're set to be a TV series or a film, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO's The Last of Us</a></strong> or the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-movie-is-already-a-new-hit-franchise-says-sony/">Uncharted</a> </strong>movie, are easy to imagine with regard to their plot. We didn't have to wonder what kind of story <strong>Craig Mazin</strong> would try to tell with his Last of Us show. The same goes for Uncharted, because we knew it would be another treasure-hunting romp featuring Nathan Drake.</p>



<p>The same can't be said for this upcoming Helldivers movie; Lin could take the Starship Troopers-esque world Arrowhead has built and take it in several directions. What we can at least expect is that the film will stay true to the mixture of violence and comedy that Helldivers is known for, and, considering Lin's directing background, plenty of over-the-top action.</p>



<p>Lin hasn't directed every film in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but he has several under his belt. After directing <strong>Tokyo Drift</strong> in 2006, he directed Fast &amp; Furious in 2009,<strong> Fast Five</strong> in 2011, and <strong>Fast &amp; Furious 6</strong> in 2013. After that, he returned to the series to direct <strong>F9</strong> in 2021. With how grand the scale of action is when playing <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, Lin seems like the perfect choice to lead a film adaptation.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa, on the other hand, is a bigger question mark. It'll be interesting to see how he slots into this film, though his work in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">The Minecraft Movie</a></strong> suggests that he's more than up for a silly, video game-inspired adventure, and that he can be part of a movie hitting some serious numbers at the box office.</p>
