			<p>Today, Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1892272985962402180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new major <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hades II</a> update called Warsong. The patch introduces the game's final confrontation, allowing protagonist Melinoë to fight all the way to the top of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits there. There's a new Olympian (the God of War) to meet, who has many blessings to bestow upon Melinoë; and the new (and final) animal companion that will help her in battle.</p>
<p>The developers introduced several powerful new boons and improved many existing ones. The Altar of Ashes has been overhauled, though, featuring updated effects and brand new artwork. Resource gathering has been revamped, too. Players can gather any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each tool; resource appearance rates have been adjusted as well.</p>
<p>Menu screens will feature new and enhanced animations. More importantly, the story has been greatly expanded thanks to over 2,000 new voice lines, including new dialogue events for many characters.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, Psyche can no longer be found as a location reward; bones can now be found earlier instead. All Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style health bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of the player's spells. Any damage resistance effects the player has will no longer affect any armor they have. Furthermore, the requirements for certain key events have been adjusted; as a result, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p>
<p>The Warsong update also adds new foes, locations, and Chaos Trials (the Trial of Thunder, a Zeus-themed Trial set in Erebus; the Trial of Glory: a Hera-themed Trial set on Olympus; the Trial of the Fall: a Demeter-themed Trial set in the Mourning Fields; the Trial of Slaughter: an Ares-themed Trial set in Ephyra; the Trial of Destiny: a Chaos-themed Trial set on Olympus; and the Trial of Strife: an Eris-themed Trial set in Thessaly) to Hades II.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games confirmed that plans are already underway for the third big update, and the 1.0 launch, while still some time away, is getting closer.</p>

			<p>Techland has announced that starting today, the Tower Raid roguelite co-op mode that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been tested since mid-2024</a> is now available permanently in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. This is part of the franchise's 10th anniversary celebrations and roadmap, which we dived into during <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-10th-anniversary-qa-with-franchise-director-tymon-smektala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent interview with Techland's Tymon Smektala</a>.</p>
<p>In Tower Raid, Dying Light 2 players won't be playing as the game's regular protagonist, Aiden Caldwell. They will instead choose from four different characters, each belonging to a specific class archetype: Tank, Brawler, Ranger or Specialist. Each comes with their own unique set of skills. Players who really want a challenge may choose to go with a smaller squad than four, or even solo if they want to test themselves against the zombies.</p>
<p>There are three difficulty modes available: Quick, Normal and Elite. This choice affects the length of the session. Each run features a new mix of floors and challenges, ensuring a dynamic experience at every attempt at climbing the Tower.</p>
<p>The developers are also introducing a new progression system that was engineered to reward persistence through runs. With each failure, players unlock new skills and equipment to improve their chances on the challenging run. In the Tower Raid hub, players will also find Sola, a trader offering unique rewards such as the Office Day Outfit, the Kuai Dagger and the Silenced Pistol.</p>

<p>While this is a full release of Tower Raid in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Techland said it's actively seeking player feedback through the franchise's official social media channels (Facebook, X, Instagram), Discord and Reddit communities to further refine the gameplay experience. In addition, a special survey will be released in a few days to gather further insights from players.</p>
<p>As we learned in the aforementioned interview, the Polish developer still has big plans to update this game despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Summer launch window for the spin-off Dying Light: The Beast. Throughout 2025, Dying Light 2 is getting coop gameplay and matchmaking improvements, Community Map support improvements, new Tower Raid characters, new firearms and melee weapons, a new weapon class, further Prologue improvements, and graphical/technical improvements.</p>
