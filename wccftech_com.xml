			<p>Project Titan, the codename for the next game from Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, appears to have been cancelled. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lwgzeh/titan_project_of_striking_distance_from_the/">Reddit</a>, a senior technical artist at Striking Distance Studios, which was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield as a subsidiary under Krafton, listed Project Titan as a cancelled game that they worked on. They listed their tasks on the project as character, weapon, and prop setup and rigging, which were also tasks they did when working on The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>When Striking Distance Studios (SDS) was first announced as a new team with Schofield leading the way, there were a lot of reasons to be excited about the new studio. It was a team of veteran developers, all coming together to leverage what was at the time the next generation of consoles, and though we didn't know it for sure at the time, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-to-glen-schofield-about-striking-distance-cinematic-narrative-experience-set-in-pubg/">Wccftech spoke to Schofield</a> about the "<em>cinematic narrative experience</em>" they were creating at SDS, we could only hope that the team was making a game akin to Dead Space.</p>



<p>Fans of horror games, like myself, got their wish when The Callisto Protocol was revealed. It was billed as a 'spiritual successor' to Dead Space, and with Schofield directly behind the project, it felt like there was potential for a new series of horror games. </p>



<p>Obviously, that is not how things panned out. The Callisto Protocol seemed to have a myriad of issues even in development, as Schofield publicly discussed what appeared to be a pretty<a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/"> awful period of crunch that the team went through.</a> Then, when it arrived, it did so to middling reviews across the board, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">including from us here at Wccftech</a>.</p>



<p>It didn't help that EA released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">stunning remake of the game that</a>, for all intents and purposes, launched Schofield's career to a new level a month after The Callisto Protocol failed to impress, but the success of EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is hardly what stopped The Callisto Protocol from taking off. Schofield later revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-was-released-too-early-admits-glen-schofield/">the game was launched too early,</a> and that part of the crunch issues the team suffered came from Krafton not giving the team approximately three to four more months to complete their work on the game that they thought they were going to have.</p>



<p>SDS suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-layoffs-future-projects/">multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">layoffs</a>, and Schofield ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">left the studio</a> less than a year after the game's launch and subsequent failure. Last year, we learned that the team was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">working on a new game, </a>which was presumably the now-cancelled Project Titan. It's unfortunate that a team with such high hopes has had such a tragic journey. Hopefully, there's a better chapter to come for the team with their next project, and the next time we hear about Striking Distance Studios isn't to find out that they've been shut down.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FBI Seizes Popular Nintendo Switch ROM Site]]></title>

			<p>The FBI has seized and taken down one of the more prominent Nintendo Switch ROM sites, Nsw2u. First reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site was seized earlier this week on Thursday, though according to some of the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/new/">Switch Piracy Reddit page</a>, the site remained up for a few hours before being entirely taken down. If you try to visit the website now, you'll be met with a splash screen from the FBI notifying that the site has been seized "<em>in accordance with a seizure warrant</em>."</p>



<p>The splash screen also includes a logo from the FIOD Tax Administration, a Dutch agency that was involved in investigating the site and having it taken down. Nintendo has not commented on the takedown, but it's clear that this is a part of the company's more aggressive effort to combat piracy on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices. </p>



<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">ability to brick Switch 2 devices</a> is something that's been widely reported by now, another sign of just how serious Nintendo is about players using their devices in what the company deems to be an "<em>unauthorized</em>" way, even if they are being fought<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/"> by regional government agencies</a>. After all, it didn't take very much for players to be able to jailbreak Switch devices at launch. All it took to open the door to a jailbroken Switch was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip,</a> before Nintendo had released revised models of the console to nullify the popular method. </p>



<p>That didn't stop players from jailbreaking the device, however, and the battle against piracy is one Nintendo continues to fight. </p>
