			<p>Like the first two entries in the trilogy,<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong> <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em> will be powered by Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>. While this choice was somewhat expected, especially to get the game out in a reasonable amount of time, some have been disappointed by this confirmation, fearing that the third and final installment of the series will be less advanced than other games powered by <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the trilogy's director <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>, this will not be true. Quite the contrary, actually: <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong> will be a better game precisely because it uses <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-is-progressing-very-smoothly-we-ask-director-naoki-hamaguchi-why-the-team-chose-not-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> commented on how the confirmation of the game using <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> became a hot topic of discussion. <em>"But I think most people aren’t necessarily familiar with the actual differences between Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5,"</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>"Around the time we began developing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Unreal Engine 5 was just entering its pre-launch phase. What makes Unreal Engine 5 groundbreaking compared to Unreal Engine 4 are two features: Lumen, its lighting system, and Nanite, which allows you to portray dense graphical detail,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said in regards to the perception that a higher version number means something is more advanced. While these represent the current trends in graphics pipelines, tying the game's development to the <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> roadmap may have risked slowing down the creation of the game.</p>



<p>As such, <em>"we decided early on in development of FFVII Rebirth to stick with Unreal Engine 4. We’re using a graphics pipeline built in-house, which also makes optimization and porting to various hardware more straightforward,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said.</p>



<p>Having such an established pipeline following the development of <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em></strong>, <em>"rather than rebuilding our pipeline from scratch in Unreal Engine 5, it’s far more efficient for us to use Unreal Engine 4,"</em> the series director said. <em>"With all of this in mind, we judged that continuing with Unreal Engine 4 would definitely lead to a better third installment for our customers."</em> </p>



<p>Considering how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> built upon pretty much every visual and gameplay feature of its predecessor, it's not surprising to learn that the development team is using the same approach for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong>. The experience with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> is definitely going to help the studio with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong> versions of the game as well, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-30-fps-switch-2/"><strong>target 30 FPS whenever possible.</strong></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-smashes-previous-franchise-records-steam/</link>
            <guid>1448149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> is officially out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. Following a great reception from critics, the next crucial test to see if <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s latest game in the survival horror franchise is another success is the commercial one. It'll take some time to know for sure, but the very first indicator we have for any game, Steam player concurrency, is already looking good.</p>



<p>In just a few hours, Resident Evil Requiem has already crushed all previous all-time concurrency peaks from Resident Evil games. Right now, it stands at<strong> 267K players</strong> <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3764200/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, and the figure is likely to rise further throughout this weekend, as people have more time to dive into the adventures of Grace and Leon.</p>



<p>For comparison, the second game in this chart is 2023's <strong>Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong>, which reached <strong>168K</strong> players. 2021's <strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> barely surpassed a hundred thousand (<strong>106K</strong> to be exact) simultaneous players, and 2019's <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> registered <strong>74K players</strong> at its height. That said, one might easily spot a pattern here: the newer games generally did better. The only exception to this was 2020's <strong>Resident Evil 3</strong>, which did worse than its predecessor, stopping at <strong>60K</strong> concurrent players on Steam. However, it was just one year after Resident Evil 2, and the game received significant criticism for its cuts (which <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-last-escape-mod-restore-cut-content-add-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a modder is now trying to restore on PC</a></strong>). For the record, 2017's <strong>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</strong> only reached <strong>20K</strong> concurrent players.</p>



<p>The main reason is that <strong>Steam's player base has massively increased since 2017</strong>. As we outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when Valve's platform hit its latest concurrency record (42 million users) last month</a>, <strong>there was a 139% increase</strong> from 2017's <strong>17 million</strong> concurrent users. Even with this caveat, though, the hype for Resident Evil Requiem is very real. Here's an overview of our extensive coverage of the game:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The bidding war on <strong>Warner Bros. Discovery</strong> is suddenly over: a few hours ago, <strong>Netflix</strong> <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially dropped out with a joint statement by its co-CEOs</a> (<strong>Ted Sarandos</strong> and <strong>Greg Peters</strong>), who clearly explained that matching the latest price offered by competitor <strong>Paramount Skydance</strong> would have meant the deal was no longer financially attractive for the streaming giant. They added:</p>



<p><em>We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.</em></p>



<p>Just a couple of hours before this statement from Netflix's top executives, <strong>the Warner Bros. Discovery board had declared Paramount's latest offer "the superior bid"</strong>, giving Netflix four days to match it or abandon the negotiations. They quickly chose the latter.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-timeline-of-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war">The timeline of the Warner Bros. Discovery bidding war</h2>



<p>Let's rewind the clock. Warner Bros. Discovery, formed in 2022 through the merger of AT&amp;T and Discovery, <strong>officially went up for sale in the latter half of 2025</strong>. In October, the board <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it was already reviewing interest from multiple parties</a>.</p>



<p>Just around five weeks later, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix announced a deal with the WBD board to acquire the Studio and Streaming assets for $72 billion (with a total evaluation of $82.7 billion)</a></strong>. Three days later, though, Paramount Skydance <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its own $108.4 billion all-cash "hostile" offer</a></strong>. <span>The WBD board&nbsp;<strong>initially recommended that shareholders reject the offer and accept Netflix's</strong>, but Paramount Skydance did not relent.</span></p>



<p>On February 10, 2026, Paramount upgraded its offer to include several key provisions:</p>



<ul>
<li>An agreement to <strong>cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee</strong> WBD would owe Netflix for walking away from their deal </li>



<li>A commitment to <strong>backstop a debt refinancing</strong> that would cut WBD's costs by <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> </li>



<li>A <strong>ticking fee of $650 million in cash per quarter</strong> if the deal was not completed by the end of 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>That started turning the WBD board's heads away from Netflix, but the final bid was made on Tuesday, February 24, <strong>upping the offer to $31 per share in cash</strong>. For comparison, Netflix's offer was $27.75 per share. This means Paramount will acquire the entire WBD (whereas Netflix wouldn't have purchased the linear cable networks) for <strong>$111 billion</strong>, making it objectively the superior offer.</p>



<p>It's hard to say how that will affect Warner Bros. Discovery's gaming division (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-teases-return-to-biggest-franchises-in-2027-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that major releases are expected either next year or the following year). However, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we do know that Netflix did not factor WB Games into their offer at all</a></strong>, considering it to be "relatively" minor; on the other hand, Paramount does own <strong>Skydance Interactive,</strong> which has released several VR games, and <strong>Skydance New Media</strong>, <strong>Amy Hennig</strong>'s studio working on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-once-again-now-arriving-mid-late-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-will-get-to-make-a-star-wars-game-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">untitled Star Wars game</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping they have a solid plan already in place for Warner Bros. Games.</p>

Solving this is mandatory, as it contains an item essential to advancing the story. Without it, Grace won't be able to escape the hellish care center.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-clue">The Clue</h2>



<p>When you first enter the office, you will notice a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">notepad</strong> sitting on a table. This notepad holds the key to the puzzle, but the indentations from the previous writing are currently invisible, and you need a specific item to show the solution.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-pencil">Where to Find the Pencil</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Chairmans-Office-Pencil-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Without the pencil, you will never discover the puzzle box's combination</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reveal the code, you need to find a writing utensil. Proceed to the smaller <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">office in the back</strong> connected to the main room.</p>



<p>There is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy</strong> lurkinghere. If you have enough ammo, defeat it to search in peace. If you are low on health or ammo, you can avoid the enemy, quickly grab the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pencil</strong> from the desk, and retreat back to the main room.</p>

<p>Once you have the Pencil in your inventory, return to the main office. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Use the Pencil</strong> with the blank notepad. Grace will shade over the paper, revealing the hidden <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Safe/Puzzle Box combination</strong>. Input the revealed code into the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Puzzle Box</strong> located in the same room and it will finally open.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-reward">The Reward</h2>



<p>Inside the box, you will find the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Moon Quartz</strong>. This is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">three critical items</strong> required to escape the Rhodes Hill Care Center. However, as you will need to collect two more, and your inventory's space is likely limited, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">store it inside the box</strong> found near the care center's main hall before continuing your search.</p>

While this choice is often down to <strong>personal preference</strong>, the distinct gameplay styles of Grace and Leon mean that <strong>one perspective usually outshines the other</strong>, depending on who you are controlling.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-camera-settings">Best Camera Settings</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Camera-Options-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can change between first-person and third-person camera at any time</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you want the most polished experience, I recommend <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">First-Person for Grace</strong> to maximize the horror atmosphere and <strong>Third-Person for Leon</strong> to master the combat, which are the exact same recommendations the game provides at the very beginning. </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">You can change your camera options for each individual character from the Camera tab in the Options menu at any time during gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-grace-why-first-person-works-best">Grace: Why First-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Grace-First-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>First-person camera is the most immersive in Grace's segments</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For Grace’s segments, which lean heavily into atmosphere and exploration, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">first-person is the optimal way to experience the game</strong> for a few reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Grace's segments, the camera often shifts to first-person during cutscenes. If you are playing in third-person, these transitions can feel abrupt and immersion-breaking. Staying in first-person ensures a seamless flow between gameplay and certain story beats.</li>



<li>A minor but noteworthy difference occurs during frantic escape sequences: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace can trip in third-person, but not in first-person.</strong> While this doesn't happen constantly, avoiding a stumble during a chase can be the difference between life and death in certain situations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-leon-why-third-person-works-best">Leon: Why Third-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Third-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Third-person camera works best for Leon mostly due to combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Leon’s segments in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, on the other hand, are built around intense combat against a high number of enemies, making <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">third-person the superior choice for his segments.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Leon often faces much larger groups of enemies than Grace. The wider field of view provided by the third-person camera is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">essential for keeping track of multiple threats</strong>, preventing you from being surrounded, and allowing you to respond quickly with a shotgun blast or a well-timed parry.</li>



<li>While first-person can be beneficial for precision aiming, Leon can find specific <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gun parts</strong> that allow him to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">aim down sights</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in first-person</strong> with weapons other than sniper rifles, even while the general camera remains in third-person. This gives you the accuracy of a shooter without sacrificing the spatial awareness needed to survive some of the sticky situations he finds himself in often during the game.</li>

			<p>Surviving the nightmare in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong></em> requires more than just solid shooting skills. Whether you are navigating claustrophobic halls as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace Ashcroft</strong> or engaging in intense combat sequences with Leon S. Kennedy, understanding some of the game's underlying systems is the difference between life and death, especially if this is your first entry in the series.</p>



<p>To help you understand and enjoy the game right from the get-go, we have put together the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">best tips for beginners</strong> based on a full playthrough of the game at the highest possible difficulty for a new game run: Standard (Classic).</p>

<h2 id="h-learn-when-and-how-to-fight">Learn When and How to Fight</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Stealth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Stealth is often the way to go in Resident Evil Requiem</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although just one part of the experience, <strong>combat</strong> remains one of the core elements in Resident Evil Requiem. While <strong>Leon has much better tools for handling multiple enemies&nbsp;at once</strong>, <strong>Grace is not built for combat</strong>. She is a fragile investigator, and her resources and weapon selection are far more limited. As such, for her, the best strategy is to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fight enemies only when absolutely necessary</strong>.</p>



<p>When forced into an encounter, <strong>always aim for headshots or leg shots</strong> to stagger your enemy. Once dazed, move in for a <strong>melee attack</strong> to knock them down. This buys you precious time to either finish them off efficiently with easier headshots or, more importantly, escape the room entirely.</p>



<p>One very important element to consider for both Leon and Grace is <strong>stealth attacks</strong>, which grant you the chance of taking out an unsuspecting enemy. While Leon can do this repeatedly with his <strong>hatchet,</strong> Grace requires a <strong>Hemolytic Injector</strong>, which can be found by exploring locations or by crafting (<strong>1 Scrap + 60 Blood</strong>), so keep this in mind if you're running low on ammo, but have some of these Injectors on hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-master-the-map">Master the Map</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-East-Raccon-City-Map-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using the map, you will never get truly lost, no matter where you are</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">level design</strong> in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">intricate</strong> as per the series' tradition, and it is easy to l<strong>ose your bearings</strong> in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center or the vaster Raccoon City. Thankfully, <strong>the map is your best friend.</strong></p>



<p>If you frequently feel lost, make sure to <strong>check your map frequently</strong>. <span>The game is generous with its&nbsp;<strong>map markers,</strong>&nbsp;and any locked door </span>you encounter, or item you leave behind, is automatically noted on your map. As such, if you ever find yourself lost,<strong>just open the map</strong> and look for rooms with a door outlined in red or any other icon: <strong>the solution is usually staring right at you.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-use-crafting-effectively">Use Crafting Effectively</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Crafting-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The crafting system has some nuances to understand to be used effectively</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>crafting system</strong> works differently for Leon and Grace. While the classic series' protagonist only needs to find <strong>items</strong> to craft additional ammo and healing items,  the FBI's inspector has to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Infected</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Scraps</strong> to craft items. </p>



<p>Already in the Rhodes Hill Care Center, Grace will find <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood Transfusion Bags</strong>, which allow her to recharge the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blood Collector</strong>. When using Blood Transfusion bags, make sure to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wait until the entire amount can be used</strong>. If you use a bag when your injector is nearly full, <strong>any surplus blood is permanently discarded</strong>. In a game where every drop counts for crafting healing items, ammo, and injectors, wasting blood is a mistake you should not make.</p>



<h2 id="h-learn-advanced-reloading">Learn Advanced Reloading</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Advanced-Reloading-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Reload Canceling is a very useful technique that can make battles more manageable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most useful expert techniques in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> that is not properly explained until later in the game is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Reload Canceling</strong>. </p>



<p>If you find yourself in a bind and can't afford to wait for a long reload animation to finish, you can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cancel the operation at any time by pressing L2</strong>. This allows you to immediately transition to a shooting stance or reposition more easily if an enemy gets too close during a reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-adjust-aim-assist">Don’t Be Afraid to Adjust Aim Assist</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Aim-Assist-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Aim Assist can make the experience more enjoyable if you are not skilled at shooters</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> features intense action,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> it is not a high-speed shooter</strong>. The focus of the game is the survival horror experience and its haunting atmosphere. </p>



<p>If you are not a veteran of the genre and find combat too challenging for you, do not hesitate to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adjust the Aim Assist settings</strong> in the options menu. </p>



<ul>
<li>With <strong>Aim Snap</strong>, your character will immediately lock onto the nearest enemy. </li>



<li>With <strong>Aim Follow</strong>, your character will keep aiming at the enemy even when they are moving, making it easier to shoot them repeatedly without having to readjust your aim manually. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The effect in both settings can be tweaked with the Aim Assist slider, which ranges from 1 to 10.</strong></p>



<p>As there's <strong>no real penalty</strong> for using any of the settings above, you should use the tools provided to make the experience more manageable while you learn the enemy patterns if you're having trouble.</p>

Mastering this mechanic is essential for survival, especially at high difficulties such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-setting-in-resident-evil-requiem-for-a-first-playthrough">Standard (Classic)</a></strong> difficulty, where enemies are relentless.</p>



<p>While the game introduces the mechanic early on, the tutorial doesn't tell you everything you need to know about it. Here is how to master the parry and save your skin in the most intense fights.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-the-basics-of-parrying" data-level="2">The Basics of Parrying</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-perfect-parry" data-level="2">The Perfect Parry</a></li><li><a href="#h-which-attacks-can-you-parry" data-level="2">Which Attacks Can You Parry?</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-the-basics-of-parrying">The Basics of Parrying</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Leon-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The core of Leon’s combat mechanics in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> lies in his hatchet. By holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong>, you can enter a defensive stance to deflect incoming blows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Every time you parry an attack, your hatchet will lose sharpness. If it goes blunt, you lose your primary defensive tool until it's sharpened by holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong> and pressing <strong>Square / X / Y</strong>. Sharpening takes some time, so make sure to do so while standing away from enemies.</li>



<li>Keeping <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">L2</strong> held down is the safest way to avoid taking direct health damage, but it is not the optimal way to play as it drains a lot of durability without providing any other advantage other than negating damage.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-perfect-parry">The Perfect Parry</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Perfect-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>To truly master Leon's combat, you should always aim for a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Parry</strong>. This is achieved by <strong>pressing L2 / LB / L at the exact moment the enemy attack connects.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Perfect Parry leaves an enemy staggered and wide open for a high-damage follow-up or a  finisher, if its health is low enough.</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is one of the <strong>best moves</strong> in Leon's kit, it is also the most <strong>risky</strong>. Don't attempt perfect parries against powerful enemies you have never fought before, especially in Standard (Classic) difficulty, as you risk receiving a lot of damage. Instead, <strong>take the time</strong> to learn enemy patterns so as to attempt perfect parries with the highest confidence</p>



<h2 id="h-which-attacks-can-you-parry">Which Attacks Can You Parry?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Which-Attacks-Can-Be-Parried-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The way the in-game tutorial frames the mechanic, you might think you can <strong>only parry enemies wielding weapons</strong> like debris, pipes or chainsaws. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">That is not the case</strong>!</p>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you can parry <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">barehanded attacks</strong> just as effectively as weapon strikes, and even nullify ranged attacks like thrown debris. Like for perfect parries, learn the enemy attacks to master this defensive mechanics and destroy the undead hordes coming at Leon as he makes his way through the Rhodes Hill Care Center and Raccoon City. Do note that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some attacks cannot be parried</strong>, so learning the enemy attack patterns remains paramount for using Leon's parry effectively.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown of the <strong>best difficulty settings</strong> to choose for your first run.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-standard-classic" data-level="2">Standard (Classic)</a></li><li><a href="#h-standard-modern" data-level="2">Standard (Modern)</a></li><li><a href="#h-casual-mode" data-level="2">Casual Mode</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-standard-classic">Standard (Classic)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Classic-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>If you're as much a zombie slayer as Leon, Standard (Classic) is your choice</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those who have been playing the series for a very long time, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Standard (Classic) is the way to go</strong>. This mode is designed for veterans who want to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem </em>at its best.</p>



<ul>
<li> Enemies are slightly stronger than in Standard (Modern), making every encounter feel more tense and dangerous.</li>



<li>Grace’s segments are more in line with classic entries in the series, requiring much tighter management of your limited supplies.</li>



<li>In this mode, Grace needs <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ink Ribbons to save at typewriters</strong>.</li>



<li>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are strictly limited, meaning death carries a considerable penalty.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-standard-modern">Standard (Modern)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Modern-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Standard (Modern) retains the series' intensity while providing a fai</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> amount of ease</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you are a complete newcomer to the franchise, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">I suggest trying out Standard (Modern) first</strong>. This mode provides a relatively smooth experience that doesn't completely gut the game's atmosphere.</p>



<ul>
<li>This mode lacks the Ink Ribbon requirement found in Classic, allowing for a smoother flow for those who don't want to manage save items.</li>



<li>High stakes are what the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em> series is all about, and while this difficulty mode is not as challenging as Standard (Classic), it does a good job keeping some of the high stakes of the experience intact. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode">Casual Mode</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Casual-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Casual Mode is your choice only if you want to blaze through the story</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The easiest difficulty, <strong>Casual Mode</strong>, should be played only by <strong>absolute newcomers or those who wish to blaze through the story.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Combat encounters in this mode are easy and generally lack the signature tension of the series.</li>



<li>Ultimately, playing in Casual Mode strips the game of its core elements, creating a dissonance between the story's tense narrative and a way too high ease of gameplay, which feels like a disservice to the game's design. However, if you start on Modern and find it too intense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">you can switch to Casual at any time after starting the game</strong>.</li>
