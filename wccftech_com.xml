			<p>Developer Sonka's psychological survival horror game Holstin just got a brand new trailer during the Future Games Show, along with the news that a new, 2-hour-long demo is available for players to try, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous demos that have been available on Steam, which focused on specific mechanics in Holstin, this new demo is just the first two hours of the game for players to try, and get the full opening experience.</p>
<p>Holstin is a Resident Evil, Silent Hill-inspired horror game that uses 2XD rendering, allowing the team to "<em>seamlessly shift between multiple perspectives in real-time, lit, fully 3D pixel environments,</em>" according to a press release. Set in 1990s Poland, in a lakeside town called Jeziorne-Kolonia, you&nbsp;play as Tomasz, one of the last remaining locals who hasn't yet turned into an ooze-riddled creature.</p>

<p>Holstin is currently planned to be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and PC, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonkagames/holstin">Kickstarter campaign</a> planned to launch later in 2025 to help the development team get the game over the finish line.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of indie horror games break through into the main gaming conversation in the last few years, with games like Signalis, Crow Country, and Mouthwashing becoming indie-darlings for horror fans, all of them leaning into pixel art and a slightly more retro-look-and-feel to enhance the scares they have waiting for players.</p>
<p>Holstin looks like it could be the next game on that list, if the horror is able to deliver when it launches in the hopefully near future.</p>

			<p>With its first gameplay reveal during this year's Day of the Devs, indie developer Something We Made finally showed off the sequel to their inaugural title TOEM: A Photo Adventure from 2021. This charming photography adventure brought an easygoing monochrome adventure to hundreds of fans and left us wanting more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>TOEM 2 opens with the same plucky character from the first title dropped into the world with little more than ambition and a trusty camera. While the first game focused on ascending the TOEM mountain, I didn't catch nary a whiff of the actual motivations and reasoning for the journey this time around. Instead, I was given free reign to meander around the idyllic village and solve a variety of problems for the townsfolk, from trying to retrieve a potion of liquid courage for a scaredy-cat knight to taking photos of three goats in order to permit a bridge troll to let me pass. In my twenty or so minutes of play, I was able to help solve the small-scale problems of four individuals and be rewarded with a stamp for my collection each time.</p>
<p>The camera remains the player's best tool in the world of TOEM 2 with players not only able to use their photography skills to solve the plights of the ordinary person, but also a variety of attachments to use as tools in your adventure. The very first unlockable upgrade I earned for my camera was a hammer upgrade that let me smash through select stone blocks that hindered my progression. Using the hammer is just like the other attachments from the first TOEM: simply point and shoot (or in this case, tap on the rocks). It took a moment to realize that there's a small minigame to using the hammer with players having to tap out morse code with short and long taps in order to break those rocks.</p>

<p>One puzzle I encountered was take a 3x3 cube of blocks and chisel away to make a matching sculpture to the quest giver. Rather than trying to memorize the layout or run back and forth between the source sculpture and what I was crafting, I stopped to take photos of each side of the cube and use those to remember the requested shape. The developers from Something We Made seemed surprised that this was a valid solution to their puzzle and it was nice to see the camera being used as a note taking device as well as the tool you'll use to take pictures of every animal around the landscape.</p>
<p>New to TOEM 2 is also the addition of jumping, and in true platformer style, I had to test it out by jumping around on top of any short wall I could find and try to scale up the world. I couldn't find any unintended out-of-bounds areas, but I was at least able to find some climbable areas that would lead to new hats for the playable character. With jumping now on the menu, I wouldn't be surprised if the Honk attachment gets phased out for TOEM 2.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's still a fair bit of time before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/">TOEM 2</a> is ready to be in players' hands. Developer Something We Made and publisher popagenda have penciled in this quaint photographical adventure for 2026 across a slew of unannounced consoles as well as PC.</p>
