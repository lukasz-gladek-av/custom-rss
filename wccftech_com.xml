			<p>Developer<a href="https://x.com/mundfish/status/1931103250662707397"> Mundfish</a> has announced that Atomic Heart II is in development, and is targeting a launch on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>According to Summer Game Fest creator and host Geoff Keighley, this is a spiritual successor to the first game, and will focus more on RPG elements than the first did.</p>
<p>There's no word from Mundfish as to when it'll be ready. Today's announcement was just a trailer showing off what looks like a vastly expanded experience compared to what the first had, and that the game was in development.</p>
<p>Atomic Heart II was also not the only announcement Mundfish had for Summer Game Fest, as it also revealed a new title called <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/">The Cube.</a></p>

<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo liked the first game, but didn't feel like it hit the mark that the games it is inspired by did.</p>
<p>"<em>Atomic Heart is a solid debut for a brand-new</em> <em>developer</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/">he wrote</a>. "<em>Mundfish succeeded in following the example of BioShock to deliver an engaging first-person shooter that is fun to play (minus a few quirks), runs extremely well, and looks great. That said, the story is a letdown and should have been fleshed out more, just like the side content."</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the sequel is able to step it up.</p>

			<p>Code Vein II, the second entry in the hardcore action role-playing game series published by Bandai Namco, has been announced today with a new trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest, provides a quick look at the game's dark setting, main characters, and the fearsome enemies they will have to face, which all feel in line with what we have seen in the original game released back in 2019. The trailer also confirmed the game will be launching in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdD6dEhhges?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In case you have never heard of the original Code Vein and want to get up to speed, you can learn more about it ahead of Code Vein II's release in 2026 by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>But despite its occasionally tedious locations, Code Vein does tap into the satisfaction that comes from exploration and conquest. With no real loading screens, you’ll want to keep pushing forward, testing your luck and hopefully pushing your sidekick off a skyscraper. The combat has a lot going on, even if most of the encounters start with the same type of ambush. Whether Code Vein can be remembered in the same way as Dragon's Dogma is yet to be seen, but its over the top edgy aesthetic and pretty decent combat make it fun enough to jump into.</em></p>

			<p>Mortal Shell 2 kicked off the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase today, with an action-packed trailer showcasing the return of the Soulslike from indie developer Cold Symmetry and publisher PlayStack.</p>
<p>This sequel builds on the first game and according to a press release "<em>significantly expands on the original with unrestricted, adrenaline-charged combat, deeper weapon design with extensive upgrade options, and an emphasis on free exploration</em>."</p>
<p>Mortal Shell 2 continues with the same core mechanic that separated the first game from other Soulslikes, where you possess the shell of another to gain access to new ways of fighting and new abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Shell II - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SLSLuYMhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Cold Symmetry expanded combat and storytelling compared to the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-shell-indie-soulslike-game-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Mortal Shell</a>. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto appreciated the different approach the first game had when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-shell-ps4-shells-crack-twice/">reviewed it</a>, saying:</p>
<p>"<em>Mortal Shell is an interesting case where the Souls formula can be put to good use in an action RPG that doesn't need excessive padding or leveling to tell its story. While its incredibly short by Soulslikes standards, the unique defensive approaches to combat and the synergy of weapons/shells give Mortal Shell its own niche in the growing genre. At half the price of a traditional AAA adventure, Mortal Shell is certainly worth an impulse purchase for established fans of the hardcore action RPG genre.</em>"</p>
<p>The sequel will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>
