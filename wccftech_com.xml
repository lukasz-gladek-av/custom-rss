			<p>Right before the beginning of this year's Tokyo Game Show, PlayStation State of Play returns tomorrow with over 30 minutes of updates on announced games and brand new reveals.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">confirmed on the Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the presentation will air tomorrow, September 24, at 2 pm PT / 5 pm ET / 11 pm CEST on &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>. During its 35 minutes of duration, the presentation will provide updates and reveals from developers around the world with new looks at anticipated third-party titles, indie titles. The presentation will also feature updates from some PlayStation Studios' developers, including an extended look at Saros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">the new game from Housemarque launching next year</a>.</p>



<p>In the past few years, a PlayStation Showcase or State of Play presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-confirmed-to-air-tomorrow-showing-20-games/">took place right before the beginning of the annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">rumors suggesting that 2025 wouldn't have been different</a>, today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">June 2025 PlayStation State of Play presentation was filled with a lot of great reveals</a>, such as Romeo is A Dead Man, the next game from Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture which is setting out to be another great action game with some peculiar vibes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">judging from the time I spent with the game during Gamescom</a>, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, whose new features such quality-of-life enhancements and voice acting will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gamescom-hands-on-preview-definitive-edition-in-the-making/">elevate an already great tactical role-playing game</a>, and MARVEL TOKON: Fighting Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">a new fighting game starring Marvel Comics characters from genre masters Arc System Works</a>, so there's a very good chance the new presentation will feature some nice surprise reveals alongside the announced new look at Saros and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/">rumored proper first look at Insomianc's Wolverine.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-%E2%80%9Cpush-the-boundaries%E2%80%9D-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience.1305303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Niantic Spatial is the geospatial AI tech company that spun off from Niantic after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">sold its games business and portfolio of titles</a>, including Pokémon GO, Monster Hunter Now, and Pikmin Bloom, to Scopley. Niantic Spatial seemed to be out of the videogames industry, until last night, during the Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand anniversary presentation, Niantic Spatial chief executive officer and Niantic founder John Hanke joined Hideo Kojima on stage to announce a partnership between the two entities to create what seems to be a Pokémon GO-like AR Death Stranding game.</p>



<p>The Beyond the Strand presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">featured several major announcements</a> from Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, like a teaser trailer for OD, which we now know is fully titled 'OD: Knock.' We got an update on PHYSINT with a look at the game's key art and heard from some of the actors included in the project. We heard a bit more from the team working on A24's Death Stranding film, and we got to see a trailer for Death Stranding Mosquito, the animated film based on the series, also in the works.</p>



<p>None of those were the things that closed out the show. This partnership with Niantic Spatial closed out the over two-hour presentation, as it seemed to embody the theme of the whole show, which was to look ahead into the future of entertainment and storytelling from Kojima Productions.</p>



<p>Essentially, Kojima Productions will leverage Niantic Spatial's geospatial AI tech to create an AR experience that works with your phone, and also, it seems, your <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-is-developing-dual-display-smart-glasses-to-put-messages-maps-and-more-right-in-front-of-your-eyes/">smart glasses</a>, to enable an entertainment experience wherever you go.</p>



<p>"<em>The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling,</em>" a press release for the announcement reads. "<em>For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke added, "<em>At Niantic Spatial, we're building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction. We are delighted to be working with Kojima Productions to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans</em>."</p>



<p>Overall it seems like an interesting idea for sure, and definitely not out of bounds for the kind of thing Hideo Kojima could envision and conceptualize. Whether it'll actually work as a game or as a software product that people will use and spend money on is a different matter, since we've currently no idea on how this experience is meant to come together.</p>



<p>"<em>To give just a wild example, it's like the real Death Stranding in the real world</em>," Hideo Kojima said on stage via a translator. "<em>And you could connect with people, or you could connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously, it was like, virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking more about connecting with the real environment.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-ananta-jurassic-world-evolution-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-confirmed-for-ananta-and-jurassic-world-evolution-3.1305273/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being added to a bunch of existing and upcoming PC games, including ANANTA, the free-to-play anime GTA-like open world game we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered</a> earlier today with the latest TGS 205 gameplay trailer. Naked Rain's ANANTA will launch with built-in support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and ray traced reflections to augment the visual quality. NVIDIA also shared a video previewing its technologies in action in the game.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Reikon's sci-fi first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">METAL EDEN</a> (the new game from the makers of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RUINER</a>) launched earlier this month with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Now, the NVIDIA app lets you override Super Resolution to use NVIDIA DLSS 4's latest transformer model, and you can also bump Frame Generation to Multi Frame Generation (x3 or x4). </p>



<p>Last week, the cooperative survival horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141730/Backrooms_Escape_Together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backrooms: Escape Together</a> (currently in early access) was updated with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction. The game already supported  DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Though the game's official launch date is set for Thursday, September 25, Silent Hill f launches today for users who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition. The game includes NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution support. In our review, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>At 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and the settings above, the game ran at an average of 116 FPS, 59 1% Low on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) in a benchmarking session held in Ebisugaoka at the start of the game, right after the first attack of one of the Fog Monsters, which are, all around, pretty decent results, considering the performance cost Lumen generally has. With the game running as expected on my system, tweaking the settings, especially the lighting setting, the rendering resolution, and the upscaler setting (TSR and FSR are available besides DLSS) should be more than enough for most users with a relatively modern machine to run the game smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater also launched with just NVIDIA DLSS SR, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-add-lumen-rt-dlss-4-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was rather easy to add</a> NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and Lumen RT. Perhaps the same will happen with Silent Hill f.</p>



<p>Next month, Frontier Development will launch Jurassic World Evolution 3, a new installment in the management and construction simulation game based on the popular movies. Jurassic World Evolution 3 will offer day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray traced effects.</p>
