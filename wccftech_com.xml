			<p>It is somewhat of a mystery how, more than eleven years after the first <strong>John Wick</strong> film, there is still no triple-A action game based on the beloved character interpreted by <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>. </p>



<p>2014's John Wick spawned not only sequels but a veritable universe for owner <strong>Lionsgate Studios</strong> to exploit, as seen recently with the <strong>Ballerina</strong> spin-off movie featuring <strong>Ana de Armas</strong>, the single-season prequel TV series, and two future spin-offs, in addition to the highly anticipated fifth mainline entry.</p>



<p>However, gamers were only treated to the indie turn-based strategy game John Wick Hex, a mix between X-COM and Superhot <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed by <strong>Mike Bithell</strong></a>. It was a great game in its own right, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in Wccftech's review</a>, but it was certainly far removed from the cinematic spectacle that we've come to associate with the films. Hex <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually delisted from all stores earlier this year</a>, so it's not even available for purchase any longer.</p>



<p>Back in November 2022, Lionsgate mentioned it was 'exploring' several pitches for a triple-A John Wick game. During the most recent investor call that followed their Q2 2026 report (a complete transcript is available <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LION/earnings/LION-Q2-2026-earnings_call-372593.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Yahoo Finance</a>), <strong>Chairman of the Motion Picture Group Adam Fogelson</strong> provided a small update on this, as well as a game adaptation of the <strong>Saw</strong> horror franchise:</p>



<p><em>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule. I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly unclear, based on the wording, whether the deals have already been signed between Lionsgate and some triple-A developer or not. Even in the best-case scenario, where they are already underway, triple-A game development typically takes at least four to five years nowadays, so <strong>we'd likely have to wait until 2030 or even longer</strong> to actually play these games. Still, both franchises have a lot of potential to become successful gaming adaptations.</p>



<p>Which developer would you like to see at the respective helms? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida</strong>, known as the producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong> and the director and producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong>, has teased a port of the popular <strong>MMORPG</strong> to <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> platforms during an in-game New Year celebration on Japanese servers. As <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by the blog Livedoor, when asked about it, he replied 'Please look forward to it.' It's not quite a confirmation, but fans are taking it as a definite sign that progress is being made on that front. </p>



<p>Yoshida previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed the possibility</a> back in June 2024, when he opened the door to the port, but also suggested that it might not happen for quite some time. Now we're into 2026, though, so we might be closer to an announcement.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy XIV director then returned to the topic in a Gamescom 2025 interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, when he mused on the benefits of such a port for existing players and newcomers.</p>



<p><em>For existing Final Fantasy XIV players, if hypothetically a Nintendo Switch 2 version was released, they would have the chance, for example, going through the main story—they could play that on the PC and do raiding on the PC. But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content, and I'm super excited about that sort of possibility for our players.</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV, the younger generation, if they started playing on Switch 2, being an MMO, it could be a genre new to them, and I would be really happy to introduce these new players to the genre and let them have fun with the game. It's precisely because of this that we have started discussions with Nintendo, and so far they have been positive, so I really hope that players can expect good news in the future.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, though, in the New Year message, Yoshida appears to have referenced Switch in general, rather than specifically the Switch 2. Final Fantasy XIV was originally released on the PlayStation 3, so it could certainly run on the Switch, although that platform has long since been abandoned and the latest expansions are a bit more taxing than the base game. The safest bet is to assume that the game will only launch on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, the game recently received patch 7.4, which introduced new Main Scenario Quests,​ a new dungeon, a new Trial,​ the Heavyweight Raid Tier for the Arcadion series,​ an overhaul of the Glamour System Overhaul, and a new​ Frontline map.</p>



<p>Chinese players already have a taste of playing the MMORPG on the go <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-gets-official-announcement-playtesting-begins-soon-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the mobile version</a>, <strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Crystal World</strong>, which was developed by Tencent's LightSpeed Studios and released in China on June 19, 2025. A global launch date has not been confirmed yet.</p>

			<p>Today, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> sent the first <strong>GeForce NOW Thursday</strong> blast of the year, revealing the PC games that have entered the library this week and also those scheduled to be added throughout the whole month.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the former list. There's a new indie game that just launched, <strong>My Winter Car</strong>, and four games that have been out for some time but are now being supported by GeForce NOW. Eternights was not at all available on NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform, while the others could be streamed but only if you owned them via Steam; now, they can also be streamed if you own them via the Xbox or Epic Games stores.</p>



<ul>
<li>My Winter Car (New release on Steam, Dec. 29)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/eternights-is-an-action-game-with-dating-sim-elements-set-during-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternights</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> (Epic Games Store, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I continue to be a strong advocate for Don't Nod's <strong>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</strong>. If you enjoy the latest God of War games, this is one you don't want to miss. It's a little less polished, sure, but its overall quality is not that far removed from Santa Monica's acclaimed masterpieces, and it also offers a much greater degree of player agency. <strong>The Casting of Frank Stone</strong> and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong> are also two great titles in their respective genres.</p>



<p>As for the rest of January 2026, GeForce NOW users can expect the following titles to populate their library in the coming weeks:</p>



<ul>
<li>StarRupture (New release on Steam, Jan. 6)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathologic 3</a> (New release on Steam, Jan. 9)</li>



<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check (New release on Steam, Jan. 12)</li>



<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Jan. 20)</li>



<li>Nova Roma (New release Steam, Jan. 22)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-reforged-out-december-3-controller-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> (Steam)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou (Steam)</li>



<li>Supermarket Simulator (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Admittedly, when comparing this list with the official game release schedule, several notable titles are missing, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2XKO</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a></strong>, <strong>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein II</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/front-mission-1st-remake-to-release-this-november-front-mission-3-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Front Mission 3 Remake</a></strong>. That said, it is still possible NVIDIA will add them to GeForce NOW at a later time; the initial list announced at the beginning of each month is usually bolstered by several late additions.</p>
