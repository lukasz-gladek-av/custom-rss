			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are out later this month on October 16, 2025. Unless you're the person who got yours more than two weeks early thanks to Amazon France shipping it out way ahead of release.</p>



<p>At least, that's what seems to have happened in the photo shared by The Verge's Tom Warren now that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1num2ad/quick_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">original post was deleted from Reddit</a>.</p>







<p>It's not exactly the best start for ASUS and Xbox regarding the rollout of this device, but it's at least exciting for user Technical_Fun77, whose post was caught before it was deleted, and also left their own user review of the device, which <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-has-already-shipped-to-some-lucky-gamers-and-the-first-review-is-in">The Shortcut</a> was able to catch.</p>

<p>Technical_Fun77 also isn't the only one who got their Xbox Ally X early, as another user (spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-amazon-france-release-two-weeks-early/">TheGamer</a>) shared they also received their new PC handheld from Amazon France over two weeks ahead of time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems that if you ordered your Xbox Ally X from Amazon France, it's worth keeping an eye on the order to see if it also is on its way to you ahead of time. Everyone else can simply hope and pray that their retailer made the same mistake, or just wait the remaining two weeks like the rest of us.</p>



<p>If you've not secured your own yet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">have the pocket change to dump $599 or $999 on either of the new handhelds</a>, then it's still worth trying your local retailers to see who still has one in stock. </p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's report by Insider Gaming</a> that the employees of Electronic Arts subsidiary BioWare are already very worried about layoffs due to the company's $55 billion buyout, an EA employee FAQ <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> appears to promise that, at least for now, there's nothing to worry about.</p>



<p><em>There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work as a result of this transaction. Our focus is on driving innovation and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment.</em></p>



<p>Of course, this is no guarantee there won't be any layoffs later down the road. After all, even Microsoft waited some time after acquiring Activision Blizzard to do its own mass layoffs.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the FAQ, the company tells its employees why the buyout will benefit EA's overall strategy going forward:</p>



<p><em>As a public company, EA operates within the framework of public market expectations. Being a private company allows Electronic Arts to adopt a longer-term investment horizon, with greater latitude to pursue bold strategies without quarterly public market response.</em></p>



<p><em>This partnership gives us the ability to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage. With a longer investment horizon – and the same discipline, focus, and operational excellence that has fueled our success – we’ll have greater creative and operational flexibility to drive innovation and build the next generation of entertainment experiences. We will continue to take bold creative bets and invest in our largest growth opportunities in service of our global communities of fans and players.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Electronic Arts claims the company is financially strong, and the deal allows the publisher to 'unlock new opportunities'.</p>



<p><em>EA is in a strong financial position. This partnership gives us the ability to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage.</em></p>



<p>However, we know that the publisher actually has a lot of debt, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including $20 billion that partly funded this buyout from the Consortium (PIF, Silver Lake, Affinity Partners)</a>.</p>
