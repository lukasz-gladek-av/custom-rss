<p>Several years after the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 2</a>, Team Ninja returns to the series with <strong>Nioh 3</strong>, after cleansing their palate with many other franchises. Except for 2021, the highly prolific division of Koei Tecmo has released a new game every year, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> in 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> in 2023, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> in 2025. Most of these games had their own twists: Stranger of Paradise was a peculiar (and controversial) reinterpretation of the original Final Fantasy featuring a whole party of characters; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was the studio's first foray into a Chinese fantasy setting; Rise of the Ronin was an ambitious open world action RPG similar to the recent Assassin's Creed games; and of course, Ninja Gaiden 4 allowed the studio to reintroduce its most prized IP to newer generations with the help of PlatinumGames.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden may be witnessing a resurgence in popularity, but the Nioh series also gained a significant following over time. Koei Tecmo is now self-publishing the new game, too, so they have an even greater interest in making a bigger splash with this new entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Nioh 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during June 2025's State of Play event. Right away, Koei Tecmo confirmed the early 2026 target release window. In September, Amazon Japan <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> the final release date of <strong>February 6, 2026</strong>, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a few hours later during September's State of Play.</p>



<p>Players will be able to test the game ahead of its release, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free demo</a> launching on <strong>January 29, 2026</strong>. The demo's save file will carry over to the full version, allowing demo players to continue the journey right away.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, whereas the first two Nioh titles were published by Sony and released on PlayStation 5 several months before the PC version as part of the exclusivity agreement, this new game is being published by Koei Tecmo and is therefore the first in the franchise to get a <strong>simultaneous release on PlayStation 5 and PC</strong> (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>).</p>



<p>Nioh 3 can already be pre-purchased on both platforms. There are two editions: the Standard one, priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, and the Digital Deluxe Edition, priced at <strong>$109.99</strong>. The latter includes the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Base game</li>



<li>Season pass comprising two DLCs, one due by the end of September 2026 and the second by the end of February 2027</li>



<li>Season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have a Pre-Order Bonus and an Early Purchase Bonus. The former will activate if you buy the game before the launch date, whereas the latter can still be received as long as you purchase Nioh 3 by <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. The Pre-Order Bonus provides the Hellfire Equipment Set (Hellfire Warrior Armor set + Hellfire Ninja Attire set) and Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm (accessory), whereas the Early Purchase Bonus grants you access to the Hellfrost Equipment Set (Hellfrost Warrior Armor set + Hellfrost Ninja Attire set). Koei Tecmo clarified that these bonuses could be sold separately or given away for free at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, Nioh 3 can be described as a challenging<strong> action RPG</strong>, primarily focused around punishing one-on-one duels and boss encounters rooted in Japanese swordplay and yokai folklore. After the intermission of Nioh 2 (which served as a prequel to the first Nioh chronologically), the story returns to the late <strong>Sengoku period</strong> (16th century). The main protagonist is <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a young warrior poised to become <span>the Shogun, while his embittered younger brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tokugawa Kunimatsu,</strong>&nbsp;secretly conspires to overthrow him</span> with a horde of yokai (demons in Japanese folklore). Besieged by his brother, Takechiyo travels through time to alter the course of destiny and preserve Japan with the help of his guardian spirit, Kusanagi.</p>



<p>Throughout the course of the narrative, Takechiyo will traverse the Sengoku, Heian, Bakumatsu, and early Edo eras. The developers have confirmed that throughout the game, players will encounter a plethora of historical figures, including, but not limited to, Himiko, Saito Fuku, Hattori Hanzo, Honda Tadakatsu, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Yagyu Munenori, and Takasugi Shinsaku.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Team Ninja pitched Nioh 3 to fans as an evolution of the series' stance-based combat into a dual-style system where players can freely swap between <strong>Samurai</strong> and <strong>Ninja</strong> modes mid-fight. The <strong>Samurai</strong> style broadly resembles Nioh 1 and 2, emphasizing precision melee with katana and traditional arms, ki (stamina) management, and stance variations, enhanced by new techniques and counters introduced in this new title. The new <strong>Ninja</strong> style, on the other hand, offers a distinctly different experience that emphasizes speed, evasive maneuvers, aerial attacks, and trick-based offense, encouraging hit-and-run and mobility-heavy builds. Players can chain style swaps on the fly, opening hybrid combos that weave heavy samurai strikes into evasive ninja strings. Most of the other familiar series pillars, like guardian spirits, yokai abilities, and loot-driven progression, are returning, albeit now largely tied into a new endgame challenge framework dubbed <strong>The Crucible</strong>, which appears to function as a high-risk, high-reward gauntlet layered on top of the campaign.</p>



<p>The other major innovation is that Team Ninja moved away from the strictly mission-based map of earlier entries toward what they are calling an <strong>“open field”</strong> structure. This doesn't mean a traditional open world; instead, you can expect larger interconnected regions dotted with settlements, roaming yokai, and optional encounters, providing more continuous exploration without abandoning curated combat arenas. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our most recent hands-on preview</a>, main and sub-missions still anchor the experience, but surfacing them organically in the landscape makes progressing through a region feel less like hopping between menus and more like inhabiting a continuous war-torn countryside. Every detour—whether it is sweeping up loot, tackling Myths sidequests from NPCs, clearing Enemy Bases, or hunting down Crucible Wraiths—pushes up a regional Exploration Level that hands out permanent perks, from raw stat bumps to a fully revealed map dotted with markers for points of interest. On top of the usual torrent of gear and materials, those activities drip-feed skill points for the game’s sprawling trees and layer in extra blessings from friendly yokai and Jizo Statues. </p>



<p>Speaking during a recent interview, producer Fumihiko Yasuda also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that while the game will respect the series tradition of being quite hard, there won't be any sudden difficulty spikes. This should lessen frustration for newcomers to Nioh.  </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Team Ninja is one of the few triple-A studios that has not switched to Epic's Unreal Engine. Nioh 3 will still run on the studio's proprietary Katana Engine, last seen in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Based on the studio's previous games, the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro are likely to offer Performance and Quality modes, although this has yet to be confirmed for this title.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC system requirements of Nioh 3</a> confirmed that Frame Generation will be supported, though they do not specify whether it's AMD's, NVIDIA's, Intel's, or some combination of the three. An SSD is required.</p>

<p>The game supports cooperative multiplayer, but cross-play, as confirmed by Koei Tecmo to Wccftech, won't be available. To play with friends, you'll have to buy Nioh 3 on the same platform.</p>
