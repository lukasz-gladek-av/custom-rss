			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 Slavic-inspired Medieval Village tech demo is now available for download, hinting at how <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/">The Witcher 4</a> could look.</p>
<p>The demo, whose regular version can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSL9vdiQYMJmn0cq5PNjBxBK5hEHXD4r/view">here</a> and the NVIDIA DLSS version <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxD3QoDPIErPv4WZUcazq2Csd7HmS1Rd/view">here</a>, was developed by Scans Factory and features a variety of atmospheric lighting scenarios that are a great fit for any fantasy setting with a dark-leaning tone like The Witcher series. In case you cannot experience the demo on your system, you can watch it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>In the past few months, Unreal Engine 5.4 has been used to power some impressive tech demos, such as another demo by Scan Factory. This demo features an i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-unreal-engine-5-4-ultra-realistic-rome-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpressive recreation of Rome</a>, which looks downright incredible with its attention to detail and how it manages to capture the spirit of the Eternal City.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">5.5</a>, which brings some new features that promise to be game-changing, such as MegaLights, which allows developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights to scenes without any constraints. You can check out how some of these features can be used by taking a look at an impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-unreal-engine-5-5-remake-download/">Zelda: Ocarina of Time fan made</a> remake demo powered by the engine.</p>

			<p>20 years after its original release in Japan, Bandai Namco's Tales of Rebirth is finally getting an English translation patch this month.</p>
<p>As recently revealed by <a href="https://www.lifebottle.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Bottle Productions</a>, a team of dedicated fans who released last year a full English translation patch for what is, in my opinion, the best entry in the series, Tales of Destiny: Director's Cut, the translation patch for the PlayStation 2 version will be released sometime in December. Yesterday, it was specified on the team's official Discord server that they are aiming to have it out on the game's anniversary on December 16th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good morning, Twitter! We've got some big updates today. Our Tales of Rebirth (PS2) translation will be releasing sometime NEXT MONTH! Stay tuned for more info! Also, we made a bluesky for all of you who want to follow us outside of Twitter and Insta <a href="https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o">https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o</a> <a href="https://t.co/djSz9c0RsG">pic.twitter.com/djSz9c0RsG</a></p>
<p>â€” Life Bottle Productions (@LifeBottleProd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeBottleProd/status/1857417668669718704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides offering an English translation for Tales of Rebirth, which was never released outside of Japan, the Life Bottle Productions patch will also include some advanced features that will improve the experience, such as battle subs dynamically positioned on screen depending on how many items are obtained at the end of a battle or if the player is cooking, as highlighted by some screenshots by Julian Lightfellow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">More Tales of Rebirth refinement. End of battle subs are now positioned dynamically, depending on how many items you get, or if you're cooking. (And I'm cooking!)</p>
<p>Who's excited!? ðŸ˜ƒ <a href="https://t.co/PUwts0OBCc">pic.twitter.com/PUwts0OBCc</a></p>
<p>â€” Julian Lightfellow (@JLightfellow) <a href="https://twitter.com/JLightfellow/status/1864030187093905498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tales of Rebirth is among the PlayStation 2 entries in the series that were never released in the West and probably never will, seeing as Bandai Namco seems more interested in bringing more recent entries in the franchise on modern platforms. Next month, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-graces-f-remastered">Tales of Graces F</a> will make the jump to PC and current generation consoles, complete with a variety of enhancements, such as auto-saving, the ability to turn off enemy encounters, improved visuals, and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a while since Arkane has shelved the Dishonored IP. Granted, that part of the story was successfully concluded with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of the Outsider</a> in 2017, but there are so many parts of that unique steampunk/dieselpunk world that would deserve to have their own games. Sure, it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Deathloop takes place in the same setting (albeit in the far future), but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>A proper Dishonored 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> alongside other unannounced Bethesda games (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 remasters, a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel) during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial in 2023, but none of those projects ever materialized, suggesting they were set aside after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax.</p>
<p>While the actual franchise may be lying dormant and there's no telling when it might return with Arkane Austin <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a> and Arkane Lyon busy with Marvel's Blade, Arkane founder and series creator RaphaÃ«l Colantonio promised fans they will enjoy the next project in development at WolfEye Studios, which will marry the likes of Dishonored and Prey with an additional RPG layer. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-raphael-colantonios-next-game-is-and-isnt-like-dishonored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>People who loved Dishonored and Prey are going to feel very at home. It's uncompromisedâ€¦ We are just going full on into that kind of game in the way we create worlds, the way we let choices to the player. And I think there are going to be even more choices this time because of the RPG layer. We'll have a lot of different ways to do things.</em></p>
<p>The game will be played in first-person like Dishonored. Colantonio also confirmed it will feature shooter-like gameplay.</p>
<p><em>There is something about real-time decision making, as opposed to everything being stats, that makes us feel more in the moment, more immersed. I'm surprised the intersection between RPG and first-person shooter has not been more of a thing.</em></p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, except that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more ambitious</a> than the studio's debut (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>) thanks to a generous investment received by WolfEye early on. We do know it is set in a steampunk world and a Limited Alpha will take place next year, with sign-ups open <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow.1052334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital have revealed that My First Gran Turismo, the free trial for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Turismo 7</a>, will go live on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 tomorrow. Game creator and legendary designer Kazunori Yamauchi explained the purpose of My First Gran Turismo in a post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>My First Gran Turismo is a special free-to-play invitation to dive into the exhilarating world of motorsports. This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first Gran Turismo, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving. Whether itâ€™s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving,â€¯My First Gran Turismoâ€¯was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.</em></p>
<p><em>This isnâ€™t just about playing a game; itâ€™s about embarking on a personalâ€¯driving journey. Weâ€™ve made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges thatâ€™ll steadily refine their driving skills.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXOQLqjBWb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The My First Gran Turismo trial will feature three Race Events, three Time Trials, three Music Rally stages, a full suite of License Tests, eighteen unique cars, and these three tracks: Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit. Owners of PS VR2 can also look forward to checking out the trial in virtual reality mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news about a PC version. Two years ago, Yamauchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a statement that ignited the hopes of PC gamers; however, he quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-pc-isnt-actually-in-development-confirms-yamauchi-series-has-sold-90-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recanted</a>, clarifying that while they were open to the possibility, nothing was being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>It's strange because Sony is slowly but surely porting all of its exclusives to PC. At this point, Gran Turismo 7 might be the biggest missing one, and it's all the weirder because adding such a big platform could definitely help fill out the online races.</p>
