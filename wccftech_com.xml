			<p>Fallout New Vegas remains the most beloved out of all the games in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. While buggy, it featured excellent storytelling by Obsidian Entertainment, and many RPG fans believe this was their best work to date.</p>
<p>Over the years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-in-development-rumor-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors about a potential sequel</a> have only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten stronger</a>, particularly after Obsidian joined Bethesda in the Xbox family, and even more following the explosive success of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime Video. Besides, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart didn't exactly hide his fondness for the franchise. In October 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it. There's not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it's just 'Will the opportunity arise? I hung around at Interplay for probably an extra year because I wanted to work on Fallout more. I love Fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, we'll start looking into what those next games are going to be, and I would be surprised if Fallout is not on that list. If we were to do Fallout, it has to tie in with what Bethesda is doing with Fallout and a lot of other things, but I would always personally say my hope is that before I ride off into the sunset, I'd love to make another Fallout game.</em></p>
<p>Fans' hopes suddenly spiked yesterday when acclaimed game writer John Gonzalez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he had returned to Obsidian. Gonzalez is credited for his work on Tom Clancy's EndWar, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Horizon: Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. He was briefly the Narrative Director at Smilegate Barcelona and then at Fantastic Pixel Castle on their upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost MMORPG</a>. And yes, we said that he returned to Obsidian because, as you probably have guessed by now, Gonzalez was also the Lead Creative Designer and Lead Writer on Fallout New Vegas (for which he publicly thanks God on his LinkedIn page).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any hopes for a sequel were quickly dashed when he added the following under his new role as Creative Director at the studio:</p>
<p><em>Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)</em></p>
<p>So, the time hasn't come yet, despite Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly wanting to push harder on the Fallout franchise</a>. Still, given the studio and the writer, we're definitely eager to learn more about this new project in due time. For now, Obsidian is certainly focused on the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> in a couple of weeks, followed by The Outer Worlds 2, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debut this year</a>.</p>
