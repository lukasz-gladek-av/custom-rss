			<p>Today, Canadian developer <strong>Neojac Entertainment</strong> (known for the games <strong>Junk Survivor</strong> and <strong>Athos</strong>) announced that its next game, <strong>Frontier Legends</strong>, will debut this Spring on Early Access.</p>



<p>As you could probably guess from the title, <strong>it is a Western game</strong>, and also an open world title with survival and adventure elements. <strong>It casts players as a greenhorn settler</strong> fresh off the train, dropped into the rugged and unforgiving American West <strong>with nothing but ambition and a will to survive</strong>. Players can then become a hunter tracking game through dense wilderness, a trader running goods between settlements, a lawman keeping order on dusty streets, or even a bandit carving out a criminal empire, according to Neojac.</p>



<p>The game blends fast-paced survival mechanics with crafting, exploration, and base-building in an open world that features staples like dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and unscripted NPC encounters.<strong> One of the most ambitious features of Frontier Legends is its settlement-building system</strong>: players can grow their starting camp into a <strong>fully functioning frontier town</strong>, recruiting NPC settlers and assigning them roles in farming, crafting, gathering, and defense. The settlement's health reflects the player's leadership, so a well-managed town thrives, while a neglected one risks crumbling under the pressure of the frontier's dangers.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration is said to be central to the game's experience</strong>. Players will be able to venture beyond their settlements to discover ancient ruins, forgotten camps, legendary treasures, and hidden secrets scattered across the game world. There's also <strong>taming of wild horses</strong>, with each horse sporting unique attributes that make them valuable companions for travel, combat, and survival.</p>



<p>The game also supports <strong>cooperative and competitive multiplayer</strong>, though Neojac hasn't yet clarified how many players can play simultaneously. Anyway, <strong>players can team up to trade, build, and endure the frontier together</strong>, or take the darker path of raiding, betraying, and fighting rivals for dominance. Community events and seasonal challenges are planned to offer ongoing rewards and recognition.</p>

			<p>Wccftech recently had the pleasure of taking part in the first North American hands-on for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3493540/Transport_Fever_3/">Transport Fever 3</a>, an opportunity that was previously exclusive to Gamescom and TGS attendees. During this preview event, we got a first look at their brand new campaign as well as hands-on with the updated Free Game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Climate-Zone-Dry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Urban Games started with a bit of a look at the history of the studio, discussing how Transport Fever 3 has been a title the team has been working on for almost six years, and is the first time that they’ve attempted self-publishing their signature franchise; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/transport-fever-2-review/">Transport Fever 2</a> was published by Good Shepherd Entertainment for the PC release and Nacon for the PlayStation/Xbox console versions. By the numbers, Transport Fever 2 was the transport management simulation genre’s best-selling entry with two million copies sold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this year’s numbered entry, Transport Fever 3 is aiming to expand the focus on both the Tycoon mode and the late-game, something that fans have both been asking for. By giving players more mid-game goals beyond just hitting capital targets, Urban Games is hoping to make the third title more than just a train ride to maximum profits. For those with a more casual focus in mind, the sandbox mode allows players to build their enterprise from the ground up without having to worry about financial limits.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lane-Management-Tool-Junction-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>By the numbers, Transport Fever 3 is aiming to have more than three hundred vehicles, thirty-five industries, and over forty types of cargo. Rather than having ships be limited to the latter parts of a campaign, as in Transport Fever 3, this year’s entry wants to give players more of a reason to integrate ships into their logistics; one reason given was the introduction of both sub-arctic and offshore industries.</p>



<p>For the preview event, Urban Games permitted us to either play through two of the eight playable campaign missions (Mardi Gras in 1906 New Orleans and Woodstock’s Summer of Love festival in the mid-60’s) or dive right into the sandbox mode and develop freely. I opted for the latter, mixing different attributes together to get a 1980’s bubble era Japan with desert biomes and limited resources. Some of the other campaign missions teased were Norway’s oil rush in the 1970’s, Manila at the turn of the millennium, and a futuristic mission set in the early 2030’s that they’re keeping under wraps for now.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Road-Crossing-at-Dawn-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As someone who’s not routinely a simulation player of this nature (SimAnt and RollerCoaster Tycoon/OpenRCT2 are probably the ones I’ve dabbled with the most), diving into Transport Fever 3 required having the kiddie wings on for a little bit before I could head into the deep end. The whole menu-driven formula to Transport Fever 3 does take some getting used to at first, realizing that players need to go into one menu to build out roads, taking into consideration the number of lanes, noise levels, traffic mitigation, et cetera. Once a road is drafted up, it needs to get populated with points like bus stops or logistics routes to move goods along the road. Then a third menu to purchase a vehicle to put it on the route. Then, a fourth menu to select what goods to transport on the route. Then, the consideration of adding maintenance or supply depots along the route to keep the vehicles in top condition and the goods flowing.</p>



<p>For the average player, it’s a lot to take in all at once. For a good ten minutes, I had tanker ships doing a route between two oil derricks and a processing plant back on land, with nothing being accomplished other than paying the salaries of captains who spent eight hours a day sailing around in circles. It wasn’t until I had one of the developers point out that I needed to manually select what the ships were supposed to pick up and drop off, in this case, oil, before they would actually contribute something of value. It wasn’t like the earlier industries I was working on, where transporting vegetables from a farm in one direction or meat in another way was done automatically once a supply route was established.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Highway-Under-Construction-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Thankfully, Transport Fever 3 has a novel notification system of urgently colored messages notifying me if there’s something in my logistics network in need of attention. When it was all said and done, my army of thirty-some Japanese Kei trucks was putting in long hours, sending processed oil all across the countryside, and constantly sending out day laborers as needed to help tend these oil fields or processing plants. In the end, I felt like a proper zaibatsu tycoon managing all of these different industries, all from the comfort of my desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To cap off the event, I sat down with Nico, Publishing Manager for Urban Games, with a brief Q&amp;A of questions sourced directly from the passionate Transport Fever community on Reddit. The interview is still being actively transcribed by yours truly, so look forward to seeing his remarks shortly!</p>



<p>Transport Fever 3 is intended for a simultaneous release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC with a targeted release later this year.</p>

			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Big Bad Wolf</strong> have debuted a new gameplay trailer for <strong>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong>, just ahead of when players will get a chance to try out the game themselves when a demo is released as part of <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> on <strong>February 23, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The trailer digs into one of the game's core mechanics, investigations, as the player character <strong>Noah</strong> investigates an underwater mining station that, at least at first glance, seems to be abandoned. The trailer showcases the dark corridors of the mining station and shows Noah exploring the hallways, scanning and analyzing clues, before cutting to a montage of some of the more terrifying aspects of the game.</p>



<p>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss is set to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>April 16, 2026,</strong> and it's one of at least two Lovecraftian, Cthulhu-based games set to arrive this year alongside <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, which is due to arrive sometime in Summer 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What we'll be able to play through in the Steam Next Fest demo is currently unclear, though a press release for today's new trailer says that players can check the demo out "<em>to discover the unique atmosphere and original mechanics of this narrative investigation game before its release on April 16</em>."</p>



<p>This is the latest game from Big Bad Wolf after its 2018 mystery title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-1/">The Council</a></strong>, and its 2022 RPG, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a></strong>. This sci-fi Lovecraftian horror was also identified by Wccftech as one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Most Anticipated Adventure Games of 2026</a>, and it's exciting to see that we'll be able to get our hands on it to test if we were correct in spotting it as a game to pay attention to.</p>



<p>We'll have some coverage of other demos to pay attention to with Next Fest kicking off this coming Monday, February 23, but in the meantime, <a href="https://wccftech.com/luna-abyss-hands-on-preview-doom-returnal-a-good-time/">you can check out our preview for <strong>Luna Abyss</strong></a>, another game due to arrive in 2026 that'll be participating in Next Fest that put its demo out early.</p>
