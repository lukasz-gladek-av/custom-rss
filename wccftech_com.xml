            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced that the final update for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds expansion</a> will be released on June 3.</p>
<p>Titled 'Absolution', the update follows '<a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn</a>' and '<a href="https://wccftech.com/repentance-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-second-update-is-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repentance</a>' to conclude the trio of free updates that the developer had planned for Janthir Wilds. In this patch, players will find additions to game modes, new rewards, and a new map and story. Story-wise, they'll get to experience the robust and action-packed finale for themselves as they discover the ancient secrets at the heart of the Primordial Egress on Tyria’s frontiers.</p>
<p>The crumbling city of Bava Nisos, once a monument to Mursaat glory, lies twisted beneath three centuries of magic. The final descent to the heart of this new explorable zone involves a map-wide meta event that will lead players to the Mists Gate — the focal point of the titan invasion in Janthir. Alongside this new content, a new boss — the titan Ura — will be added to the Convergence game mode, which is designed for groups of up to 50 players.</p>

<p>Absolution also adds a new Fractal dungeon (Kinfall) to Guild Wars 2 in which players take on the role of a lowland Kodan and experience events from their cultural past. They will uncover the whispers of the elder dragon Jormag for the first time — an event which preceded their migration from northern Tyria to the Janthir Wilds.</p>
<p>The Homesteads housing feature will also be enhanced: the decoration limit will double from 1,000 to 2,000 objects, enabling players to create denser living spaces, and the Homestead Mastery level will increase to 500, granting access to new crafted decorations. A host of new rewards, including a legendary backpack and glider, new weapon sets, new relics, and updated offerings in the Wizards' Vault, will bring the 2024 expansion cycle to a close.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch to yearly expansions</a>, ArenaNet should announce the next one in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/physint-exists-because-people-kept-asking-kojima-for-a-new-metal-gear-like-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In January 2024, legendary game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with Sony to create Physint, a new tactical espionage game in the vein of Metal Gear. While Kojima's focus is currently on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which launches next month on PlayStation 5, the veteran developer also discussed what drove him to go back to this kind of project.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://pocketmags.com/eu/edge-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE</a> (issue 411, July 2025), he said that the people's wishes for a new Metal Gear game were important in the decision:</p>
<p><em>Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create. But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That’s when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint. This made me think that these multiplatform projects will help the studio live on – not just through games but in other media too. We’re exploring other forms of entertainment as well, so we are a game company, but not only a game company. This is phase two for Kojima Productions.</em></p>
<p>Kojima had recently talked about Physint in another interview, revealing that fans will have to wait a long time - five to six years - before playing the game. That's likely because after Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the studio will focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OD</a>, the supposedly revolutionary game he's making for Xbox and with the collaboration of Jordan Peele. The game will feature a cast with actors like Sophia Lillis (Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and German actor Udo Kier.</p>
<p>Following the release of Physint, Kojima said that he could finally make a movie, which was his lifelong dream.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Nintendo Switch 2 Resources Have Been Released Since Earlier Development Environment; Goal Is to Bring OS to Use Only 1 CPU Core, 2 GB RAM – Rumo]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-have-been-released-since-earlier-development-environment-goal-is-to-bring-os-to-use-only-1-cpu-core-2-gb-ram-%E2%80%93-rumo.1199310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Future Nintendo Switch 2 games may be able to use more of the system's resources, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Famiiboards forums member&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-closes-june-5th-12am-jst-please-read-newest-staff-post.55/post-1813878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattAgain</a>, a known developer who has worked in the game industry and has provided some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting insights in the past</a>, revealed that more console resources, such as CPU cores and RAM, are now available for developers compared to an earlier development environment. According to the user, the goal is to reduce the system resources reserved for the OS to 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM, which would allow developers to squeeze more out of the hardware in the future.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo, as usual, hasn't provided detailed information, we learned more about the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">earlier this month</a> thanks to the system SDK. As confirmed by Digital Foundry, the system currently reserves 3 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores for the OS, which will likely contribute to getting GameChat running without issues, although it's clear how the new feature could be rather demanding, as the system's SDK allows developers to test their games as if the feature is running without having an active session.</p>
<p>Even without all the system resources available for games, some Nintendo Switch 2 games are already showing that the system can run demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> well. The open-world RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, which will launch together with the system early next month, has already proven with pre-release footage how Nintendo's next-generation console can deliver a better experience than previous-generation systems and some of the most popular handheld systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>
