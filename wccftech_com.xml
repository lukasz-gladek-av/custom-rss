			<p>A little more than three months ago on April 2, 2025, Wargaming Group Limited, the studio behind live service hits like World of Tanks, launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/wargaming-announces-steel-hunters-early-access-date/">Steel Hunters</a>, a mech-themed free-to-play hero shooter that initially released on Steam in early access.</p>



<p>Today, Wargaming Group Limited announced that Steel Hunters will be shutting down this coming October 8, 2025, officially adding Steel Hunters to the pile of free-to-play titles unable live until its one-year anniversary, and in this case, it didn't even make it out of early access. </p>



<p>"<em>Today we share difficult news," </em>the studio began in a post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english">game's Steam page</a>. "<em>We've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters. You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment</em>."</p>

<p>Steel Hunters was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, with Wargaming's chief executive officer, Victor Kislyi saying at the time "<em>This is a massive moment for Wargaming...With Steel Hunters, we're pushing past our boundaries and bringing something completely new. Our ambition is to create one of the most exhilarating and compelling mech experiences ever</em>."</p>



<p>That the game will be shut down by October 8, 2025, means that it didn't even make it a year since it was revealed. </p>



<p>If you want to check out Steel Hunters before it is shut down for good, or if you were already playing it, then you'll be glad to know that Wargaming is unlocking everything in the game for all players. All available Hunters, including ones that Wargaming was priming for a future content update that no one had seen before, are now available in the game for players to have fun with. </p>



<p>Wargaming will also be releasing<em> </em>support for custom matches in the coming weeks so players who've enjoyed Steel Hunters can set up private community games with their friends. The studio will also host a farewell tournament for Steel Hunters before it is shut down, with more details for that to be shared soon via the game's official Discord.</p>



<p>"<em>We are immensely grateful for your time, feedback, memes, and countless memorable battles we've shared,</em>" the farewell post continued. "<em>From the very first days of Alpha, you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey. We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly. Thank you, Hunters, for everything</em>."</p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is making the jump to PS5 sometime in late 2025, developer GSC Game World has announced. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the official STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl X account, and with a short teaser trailer published through IGN, featuring characters in the game playing STALKER 2 on what looks like a STALKER-looking version of a PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>"<em>The Perimeter expands - STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is officially announced for PlayStation 5</em>," the <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1942932316466065731">studio wrote in its post</a>. It's currently available to wish list on the PlayStation Store for those who want to ensure they get a notification when pre-orders go live and the release date is announced. </p>

<p>STALKER 2 launched towards the end of 2024 on PC and as a console-exclusive for Xbox Series X/S devices, though the fact that every other STALKER game is available on PlayStation was at least a tip that those with nothing but a PS5 at home just had to be patient if they wanted to dive into the latest entry in the long-running series. </p>



<p>When it first launched, it arrived in a touch of controversy, with a number of outlets reviewing a version of the game that was decidedly broken prior to launch, only for a significant portion of those issues to be fixed with a patch that arrived just in time for launch. It still wasn't perfect, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo noted in his review</a>, but even with all the bugs, he still marked it as "<em>a worthy successor of the original in every regard."</em> Even with all its issues, earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/">STALKER 2 surpassed 6 million players worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>GSC Game World has continued to patch the game and release fixes, the most recent of which arrived just <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/">last month with a significant patch that added modding tools for PC players.</a> By the time it makes it onto PS5, there's a solid chance that PS5 and PS5 Pro players will get the best console experience from day-one, simply because they'll get to play a version that, hopefully, isn't as riddled with bugs as the game was when it launched on Xbox Series X/S. </p>
