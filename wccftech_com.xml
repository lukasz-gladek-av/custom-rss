			<p>The Complete RT shader and a selection of other visual improvements make Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater look stunning, making its visual more realistic and its lighting closer to path tracing quality.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, known modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer">MassiHancer</a> showcased the remake of the third entry in the series by KONAMI released last month on PC and consoles running with the Complete RT shader and ReSTIR G.I., which deliver path tracing quality with enhanced global illumination, ambient occlusion, tessellation, color grading and depth of field. The video also includes a few comparisons that highlight the significant improvements introduced to the game by the shader over the game's native Lumen.</p>

<p>Although the game suffers from performance and stability issues that are being addressed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">post-launch updates</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a solid remake of one of the best entries in the series created by Hideo Kojima. The faithful recreation of what is, still today, one of the finest stealth games ever released, and the addition of Legacy Style for purists and New Style for newcomers makes this remake a solid purchase for all sorts of players, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/"> review.</a></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is reportedly the next Xbox exclusive to launch on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">PPE</a> revealed that the latest entry in the Microsoft series will make its debut on PlayStation 5 sometime this November. No other information about this new edition of the game has been revealed besides the fact that it will receive a retail release alongside the digital release on the PlayStation Network.</p>



<p>Although its PlayStation 5 release has yet to be confirmed, there's a good chance that PPE's report is correct, as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been repeatedly mentioned by <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">reliable leakers</a> as one of the Xbox exclusives that will launch on other platforms before the end of the year, alongside other titles such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Starfield, whose PS5 debut is rumored to have<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/"> moved to 2026</a>. With the Tokyo Game Show right around the corner, there's a very good chance we won't have to wait too long to learn if the game is indeed launching on PlayStation 5 before the end of the year.</p>



<p>If Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on PlayStation 5 this year, it will be only the latest among many other former Xbox exclusives that have made the jump to the Sony current-generation system. Among them are Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5. The multiplatform strategy seems to be working out, as some of these former Xbox exclusives are doing great on Sony's consoles, so much so that<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> Forza Horizon 5 is currently the best-selling 2025 PS5 game to </a>, an impressive feat to accomplish for a game already available on other platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since Light of Motiram was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in November 2024, it was immediately obvious to everyone (us included) that it looked very, very similar to Guerrilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West, from the animal-like machines down to the red-haired protagonist dressed in tribal gear.</p>



<p>In July 2025, Guerrilla Games' owner Sony Interactive Entertainment <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank">sued Tencent</a>&nbsp;(the parent company of Light of Motiram developer Polaris Quest) in the state of California, alleging copyright and trademark infringement and adding that Tencent reps had reached out to Sony in 2024 about the possibility of making</span> a mobile Horizon game. Sony assumes that when talks failed, Tencent went ahead and made its own Horizon-inspired title anyway.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Tencent officially fought back with a motion to dismiss on a 'myriad of flaws', including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lack of actual jurisdiction over Tencent Holdings, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in China and merely the parent company of the actual entities developing the game, which the motion says haven't been served yet in the case: '<em>Sony’s threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony’s vague allegations against ‘Tencent’ or ‘Defendants’ generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically</em>.</li>



<li>For the time being, the claims amount to speculation as the game's release date (which has conveniently been set just now to Q4 2027 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>) is far away and the alleged infringements haven't happened and may never happen.</li>



<li>Lastly and perhaps more interestingly, the motion to dismiss labels Sony's lawsuit as a clumsy attempt to secure a corner of popular culture for themselves. </li>
</ul>



<p>In this regard, Tencent's motion goes as far as including actual quotes from Guerrilla Games, specifically from Lead Artist Jan-Bart van Beek, who mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w&amp;t=859s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a NoClip documentary</a> that when pitching Horizon, the developers initially shelved it because of its similarities to Ninja Theory's 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West:</p>



<p><em>Enslaved basically featured a post-apocalyptic world, a female protagonist, machines that were slumbering that would be awakened. So I myself went to Hermen and I said like, I don't think we should do this, it touches too much of these other points. And Hermen, he sort of was very reluctant. He said like okay, well, I think it's a bad idea to do this, but you know, we'll can it for now and maybe we'll look at it later.</em></p>



<p>That's exactly what happened. For some time, Guerrilla worked on another pitch, a shooter set in an alternate history steampunk setting loosely in the vein of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Unbeknownst to the Dutch studio, though, Ready at Dawn was already doing something not too far from that with The Order: 1886. Eventually, Studio Technical Director Michiel van der Leeuw asked Studio Head Hermen Hulst to reconsider the Horizon pitch, and Guerrilla switched back to that.</p>



<p>Tencent's point is clear-cut: </p>



<p><em>By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon—like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.</em></p>



<p>However, it should be noted that Tencent, or at least its developers who are actually making the game, have made several changes in the description and the screenshots of Light of Motiram to distance themselves from the Horizon IP. The red-headed protagonist who looked a lot like Aloy is nowhere to be seen, for instance. </p>



<p>To be fair, the actual game is probably going to play quite a bit differently. It will have survival mechanics such as base building. It also supports online cooperative play, which is missing from the Horizon games (although Guerrilla is now working <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Horizon Online</a>).</p>



<p>As to the lawsuit, we'll see how Sony responds to this motion to dismiss. We'll report any noteworthy updates on the lawsuit, so stay tuned.</p>
