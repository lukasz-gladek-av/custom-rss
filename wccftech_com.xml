			<p>Today, Microsoft announced the Game Pass lineup for August. The highlight of the lineup is undoubtedly Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will be available starting on Thursday, August 7.</p>



<p>The game, released in late 2023, was originally meant to be an expansion to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but Ubisoft later decided to make it a standalone title, albeit one that was not an open world action RPG like most of the latest titles in the franchise. Assassin's Creed Mirage was well-received by critics and fans. As to the former, here's an excerpt of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 8/10 review of the game</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>



<p>There are rumors that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be getting a DLC</a> funded by the Savvy Games Group, but there's no confirmation for the time being. Even if that turns out to be true, you'd have to pay it separately from the Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage, the following games are being added to Microsoft's subscription service this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rain World (already available through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>MechWarrior 5: Clans (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Aliens: Fireteam Elite (available via cloud, console, and PC starting on August 12 for Game Pass Ultimate, PC GP, and GP Standard)</li>



<li>9 Kings (available via Game Preview on PC via August 14 for Game Pass Ultimate and PC GP)</li>
</ul>

			<p>The PlayStation 6 will sport significantly better ray tracing performance than the base PlayStation 5, a performance uplift in line with the current generation system's rasterization performance improvement over the PlayStation 4, which somehow signals a change in focus for the company.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> provided additional comments on last week's <a href="https://youtu.be/x9WV8r-T6LI?si=sp3489uSdifLvgTt&amp;t=3327">P</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">layStation 6 leaks</a>, revealing that while specs may have been changed since that presentation, the fundamental idea behind the next-generation system hasn't changed. While the two to three times the PS5 rasterization performance estimation has been confirmed, Moore's Law is Dead provided some additional details on the system's ray tracing performance, saying that it will be five to ten times the current generation system ray tracing performance. </p>



<p>The rasterization and ray tracing performance uplift that the PlayStation 6 will deliver over that of its predecessor makes sense, according to the leaker. Rasterization performance has essentially been saturated, and with the PlayStation 5 already delivering framerates in the 80s range in some titles at 4K resolution, it makes sense to have a limited rasterization performance to hit a reasonable 4K, 120 FPS target for the most common TVs while keeping costs down and still offering a significant performance improvement where it matters more. James Prior, former AMD Senior Product Manager, agrees with this sentiment, as the focus has shifted from rasterization performance to other things like ray tracing and AI upscaling. Additionally, a 4K, 120 FPS capable machine capable of delivering RTX 4080, 5080 performance is going to be a very enticing proposition at anything below $900, especially considering some of the typical console advantages over PCs like smaller form factor, plug and play convenience, power draw and more and the fact that the system is never going to compete with gaming PCs, unlike what the next-generation Xbox could be doing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility offered by the Magnus APU</a>.  As such, <span>Sony going the other way </span>in a market with a "$1000 fatigue"&nbsp;with devices like smartphones and GPUs costing $1000 or more would be very interesting.</p>

<p>Going from what has been leaking online in the past few weeks, the next console generation promises to be extremely interesting in some unexpected ways. Hopefully, what the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox will offer will be put to good use to deliver some truly next-gen experiences that could impress even those like Hideo Kojima who are feeling a sort of stagnation with games that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">look and play the same.</a></p>
