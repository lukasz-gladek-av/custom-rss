			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Overdrive Mode, which introduced path tracing to the game, continues to be the most impressive showcase of the technology to date despite being among the very first games to implement it, as highlighted by a new comparison video shared online.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 2, and Desordre running without ray tracing, with ray tracing and with path tracing, highlighting the differences between the different rendering techniques. While the differences path tracing brings to Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth: Wukong, for example, are minimal in most scenarios, they are really transformative in Cyberpunk 2077, elevating the game's visuals to heights that no open-world game has managed to match to date.</p>

<p>While developer CD Projekt Red stopped supporting Cyberpunk 2077, the development team having moved on to working on the second entry in the series, the game is still getting image quality improvements thanks to mods and new NVIDIA DLSS versions. The upscaler's latest version, version 3.8.10, brings significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-3-8-10-performance-improvements/">anti-aliasing, VRAM, and performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.
