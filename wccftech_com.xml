			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision is rumored to launch in Europe before the end of the month, retaining the price of the currently available model.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-version-de-la-ps5-pro-arriverait-bientot-voici-ce-que-lon-croit-en-savoir-60579">Dealabs</a> by billbil-kun, who has proven time and time again to be extremely reliable regarding new video games and hardware launches, it is claimed that a new hardware CFI-7121 hardware revision discovered via Japanese certification documents is in the works and set to be launched in Europe on September 30. The changes to this new hardware revision are expected to be limited to better energy efficiency, so there won't be any change to the console's design nor to the system's SSD capacity, which will remain at 2 TB as in the current model. It is also claimed the new hardware revision system will retain the current â‚¬799.99 price tag. A launch in North America is uncertain at the time.</p>



<p>Although the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision has yet to be confirmed officially, given billbil-kun's excellent track record and the listing of the new revision in the same certification documents that confirmed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">existance of the base model Digital Edition CFI-2000 revision</a>, which indeed launched in Europe this week, there's a high probability the system is indeed launching in the region in a few days. </p>



<p>This time around, however, there should be no need to rush to purchase the current PS5 Pro model, as storage will not be reduced as a not-so-subtle way to avoid raising the system's price, which is already high compared to every other current-generation system.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has plenty to offer over the base PlayStation 5 models, including support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">improve next year</a>.
