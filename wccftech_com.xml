            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The confirmation that <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was indeed a playable character in <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a>, as promised by CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem, was a soothing balm for series fans - especially after they saw what he looks like in the game.</p>



<p>Requiem takes place much further in the timeline. Thirty years have passed since the bombing of <strong>Raccoon City</strong>, when Leon was a rookie police officer who had a very bad first day at the local Police Department in <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> (canonically set in 1998) and barely escaped with his life. He later appeared in <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> (canonically set in 2004) as an elite agent reporting directly to the president of the United States, and in <strong>Resident Evil 6</strong> (which takes place in 2013, according to the official timeline), he's still providing security for the president. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set in 2028 in the game's canon. Leon is now 51, so he's much older than when we last saw him, and yet <strong>his 'hot uncle' appearance was very well received by fans</strong>. How did that come about, though?</p>



<p>Automaton recently <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participated in a joint media interview with CAPCOM</a>, where Game Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> revealed <strong>it had a lot to do with the female staff taking care of his design</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details, like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, the women developers at Capcom did a really good job (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone’s heart throb</em>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leon is officially a イケオジ" width="422" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYdN1DDYeeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Of course, the development team did not just focus on making him look good even at his age. They also had to come up with their own take on how his personality developed over the years; on that note, Nakanishi said <strong>every staff member had their own ideas on what Leon would and would not do in a given situation</strong>. Many discussions ensued, and eventually the developers agreed on how he should behave. </p>



<p>It won't take long before fans can judge this aspect, too. Resident Evil Requiem <strong>is out in less than a month</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read our comprehensive info roundup here</a></strong>; if you need more Leon footage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-leon-gameplay-ps5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check this story</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Is Out Now on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, But Nintendo Censored It]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dispatch-out-nintendo-switch-2-but-nintendo-censored-it/</link>
            <guid>1419373</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The excellent adventure game <strong>Dispatch</strong> has just launched on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we already knew from last month's Australian eShop listing</a>. However, users quickly noticed that the game featured a lot of censorship mandated by platform holder Nintendo.</p>



<p>Those who played the game know that, at a certain point, protagonist <strong>Robert Robertson III</strong> (played by <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> and also known as <strong>Mecha Man</strong>) helps fellow hero and potential love interest <strong>Blonde Blazer</strong> with fitting a dress when a rogue nipple slips out of it. Well, that's censored in these versions of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blonde-Blazer-Censored-Nipple-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>That's far from the only occurrence. Nintendo even censored curse words, 'bleeping' them out, and <strong>there is no way for an adult gamer to override the censorship</strong>, which is very disappointing. Users have pointed out that Nintendo has hentai games on its eShop, and yet this game is being censored for no real reason. </p>



<p>In the launch press release, Dispatch developer <strong>Ad Hoc Studio</strong> only provided this statement:</p>



<p><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em></p>



<p>Dispatch <strong>is a fantastic game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dominated our Wccftech Awards '25 in the Best Adventure Game category</a></strong>, but if you own any other platform, we'd recommend playing it there instead to get the full experience.</p>



<p>If you do absolutely need to buy it on Nintendo platforms, though, know that there is a free upgrade from Switch 1 to Switch 2. The latter version features a substantial boost in visual clarity, as you'd expect, <strong>offering 1440P resolution and 60 frames per second</strong>, while the Switch 1 is <strong>locked at 720P resolution and 30 frames per second</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Enter the Dojo: Mastering Nioh 3 Combat and Arts Proficiency Flow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/</link>
            <guid>1419220</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>, the mistake you may make is treating the Samurai and Ninja styles as a binary choice, picking whichever you feel is best in each situation. And you wouldn't be terribly wrong: both styles are perfectly viable on their own and there is no direct penalty for staying in one all the time.</p>



<p>However, if you do that, you are limiting your potential. Switching between the two styles is the essential "next step" in the combat dance that the <em>Nioh</em> series has always championed. </p>



<p>Welcome to the Dojo. In this guide, we will go over some of the game's central combat mechanics, such as Arts Proficiency, and how they come together to dictate a very unique combat flow.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-why-ki-damage-matters" data-level="2">Why Ki Damage Matters</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-challenge-of-style-differences" data-level="2">The Challenge of Style Differences</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency" data-level="2">The Power of Arts Proficiency</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled" data-level="2">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-why-ki-damage-matters">Why Ki Damage Matters</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Ki-Damage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The key to combat in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> remains the same as in previous entries: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">depleting enemy Ki</strong>. By doing so, you gain a massive advantage over enemies, no matter their type.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human Enemies:</strong> Once their Ki is gone, they are open to grapple attacks.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai:</strong> Lowering their Ki allows you to stagger them with any attack, and reducing their Max Ki opens them up to a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Blow</strong> for massive damage.</li>
</ul>



<p>While you can mostly ignore these mechanics for the majority of regular enemies during your first playthrough, dealing Ki damage is non-negotiable for bosses. It is the only way to deal high damage without them constantly retaliating and interrupting you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge-of-style-differences">The Challenge of Style Differences</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Styles-2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, depleting Ki has become slightly more challenging. Samurai Style attacks are generally slower than in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, and the primary Ki-destroying weapon, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tonfa</strong>, now exclusive to the Ninja Style.</p>



<p>Because of the sheer attack speed, the Ninja Style is naturally better at chipping away an enemy's Ki through a constant barrage of strikes, regardless of the equipped weapons. This quick pace serves a second purpose as well: building <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arts Proficiency</strong> much faster.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency">The Power of Arts Proficiency</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Arts-Proficiency-Full-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arts Proficiency is the mechanic in Nioh 3 that allows you to deal boss-melting damage, not counting Living Artifact, which can still take advantage of it to utterly annihilate most enemies. </p>



<p>As you attack in either style, you fill the Arts Proficiency gauge. Once filled, your next Martial Art or Heavy Attack is significantly powered up. In addition, the more different attacks you chain together while the gauge is active, the more powerful each one becomes.</p>



<p>At this point, you can easily understand how Ki depletion and Arts Proficiency in Ninja Style start building a basic combat flow. If a Yokai isn't out of Ki, it isn't staggered by your combo, and they can and will interrupt you. Unless you equip the  Oprresive Strength Samurai skill, but that opens up a survivability problem that can only be solved with advanced builds providing automatic healing by landing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Flow-Distilled-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With all the above in mind, the basic Nioh 3 combat loop can be distilled as such:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Pressure With Ninja Style:</strong> Start the fight in Ninja Style to deplete the enemy's Ki and rapidly build your Arts Proficiency gauge.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Deal Damage With Samurai Sty</strong>le<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Once the enemy's Ki is depleted (and they are staggered), switch to Samurai Style to unleash your high-damage Strong Attacks and Martial Arts combos.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Recovery:</strong> As your assault ends, switch back to Ninja Style after using Ki Pulse to shorten your recovery time. This allows you to recover Ki more quickly, and use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu </strong>(whose charges should be full following your Samurai Style combo) to deal burst damage from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you progress and gain a deeper understanding of these mechanics, you won’t need such a rigid structure. You'll find yourself switching styles instinctively based on the rhythm of the duel. However, for those first few hours in the Warring States, this loop is highly recommended to help you mow down Yokai and build the confidence required to become the next Shogun.</p>



<p>This concludes our second Enter the Dojo guide, where we dissect the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em>Nioh 3</em> mechanics to achieve mastery</strong> deep dive into the combat flow.

<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ki Pulse</strong> remains the most important mechanic in the franchise.

<p>Watch the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">light particles</strong> surrounding Takechiyo, as they indicate the perfect window. While a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Ki Pulse</strong> (timed to the last possible second) is the goal, don't stress about perfection early on. Just get used to the "hit-and-pulse" rhythm that defines the <em>Nioh</em> series combat.</p>



<p>As you get more used to Ki Pulsing, you will be able to take advantage of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flux</strong> ability (1 Samurai skill point in the Samurai Skill tree). This ability allows you to restore even more Ki by switching stances <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">during </strong>a Ki Pulse. It takes a lot of practice, but eventually, it becomes muscle memory, further cementing the signature series' stance dancing loop.</p>

<p>In <em>Nioh 3</em>, however, the introduction of <strong>Ninja</strong> style made <strong>dodging a valuable defensive option</strong>, more than in its predecessors, with an <strong>increased distance</strong> and the ability to dodge quickly after attacking with <strong>Mist</strong>, the Ninja style equivalent of <strong>Ki Pulse</strong> (but without Ki restoration!).</p>

<p><em>This tip is more about improving your enjoyment of the game, rather than learning how to play. </em></p>



<p>The new open-field maps in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> make exploration highly rewarding.

<p>However, <strong>don't overdo it.</strong> If you clear every single icon before moving the story forward, you risk out-leveling the content and stripping away the challenge.</p>



<p>Play naturally and follow what interests you rather than chasing every waymarker. Remember that in a Team NINJA game, <strong>the first playthrough is essentially the tutorial</strong>, so you’ll have plenty of time to explore every inch of the map once the real game begins in the higher difficulty unlocked after completing the game for the first time.</p>

<p>Why are these <strong>Martial Arts essential</strong> even though they are not available from the start of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>? Because they are the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">secret sauce</strong> for maintaining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">Arts Proficiency</a></strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>These are <strong>Martial Arts</strong> for every intent and purpose, meaning they allow you to <strong>switch stances while keeping your proficiency active without breaking your combo.</strong></li>



<li>Even if you don't want to switch stances, they are still incredibly useful. For example, if you are in <strong>High Stance</strong>, you can activate <strong>Arts Proficiency</strong> with a <strong>Strong Attack</strong>, then press R1/RB + Triangle/Y in time with your <strong>Ki Pulse</strong> to unleash <strong>Frost Moon: Heaven</strong> and keep the pressure on.</li>
</ul>



<p>While only one of the <strong>Frost Moon Martial Arts</strong> may be enough to keep your Arts Proficiency combos, they also serve specific tactical purposes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Frost Moon:</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Heaven:</strong> A high-damage, slower overhead.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Frost Moon:</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Humanity:</strong> A quick strike that can actually deflect an incoming enemy attack.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Frost Moon:</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Earth:</strong> A rapid retreat-strike that puts vital distance between you and enemies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Although some of the <strong>Frost Moon Martial Arts</strong> may feel hard to <strong>combo from</strong>, every weapon has a way to <strong>link weapon-specific Martial Arts</strong> from them. For example, I found that the <strong>Sword</strong> and <strong>Dual Swords</strong> can easily link <strong>Frost Moon: Earth</strong> into <strong>Iai Quickdraw</strong> or <strong>Sign of the Cross</strong> (R1/RB + Circle/B) for devastating results.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Pro Usage Tip</strong>: If you find switching stances and using these skills tricky, try pressing the button combination twice in quick succession. It's a reliable "shortcut" I used during my playthrough to ensure </em><em>I could use these Martial Arts consistently</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-style-s-essential-martial-arts">Ninja Style's Essential Martial Arts</h2>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong> plays a completely different game than Samurai Style. As this style doesn't hit very hard and <span>lacks a traditional&nbsp;<strong>Ki Pulse</strong>, it revolves around&nbsp;<strong>movement</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>evasion</strong>, which are enhan</span>ced by the following essential Martial Arts.</p>



<h3 id="h-evade">Evade</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Evade-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Evade is a fundamental Martial Art for Ninja Style</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In its base state, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Ninja Style only restores Ki by not attacking</strong>, which forces you to halt your offense or switch to Samurai style and activate Ki Pulse after an attack. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Evade</strong> (1 Samurai Point) changes the rules considerably. This Martial Art allows you to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">restore Ki and Ninjutsu</strong> by dodging an attack at the right time. The timing is much more forgiving than a Samurai Deflect, making it a reliable defensive option.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Footstool Jump:</strong> Press Jump (X/A) near an enemy to <strong>launch off them</strong>. Since Ninja weapons feature <strong>incredible aerial Martial Arts</strong>, this allows you to stay airborne longer, dealing damage while remaining safely above most grounded hitboxes.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Mid-Air Dodge:</strong> Your safety net for aerial attacks.

Being hit in the air results in a knockdown, so this Martial Art makes an aerial playstyle much more viable and safer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-bonus-essential-ninjutsu-cicada-shell">Bonus Essential Ninjutsu: Cicada Shell</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Cicada-Shell-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Cicada Shell is an extremely useful Ninjutsu technique</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you have learned these essential Ninja Style Martial Arts and you feel ready to implement Ninjutsu into your combat flow, consider investing in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Cicada Shell</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninjutsu</strong> (1 Ninja Point).

<p>This <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">negates damage entirely</strong>, but more importantly, it serves the Ninja Style perfectly by setting you up for increased damage from the enemy's back.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-focusing-on-all-these-is-essential">Why Focusing On All These Is Essential</h2>



<p>By prioritizing these Martial Arts over specific weapon moves early on, you are building <strong>a base</strong> that makes both <strong>Combat Styles</strong> and <strong>every weapon</strong> in the game feel <strong>twice as effective</strong>.
