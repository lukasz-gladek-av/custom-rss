			<p>Along with Microsoft and Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass up by 50%</a>, the three tiers of Game Pass also changed, adding new features for each tier. But it also seems like some features were removed, namely the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would get on add-ons for Call of Duty, including COD Points.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279">CharlieINTEL on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, prior to the price change, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription got you discounts on games included in Game Pass, and in the case of Call of Duty, subscribers also a 10% discount on Call of Duty cosmetic add-ons and COD Points. Not anymore though.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty - including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's the latest example of Microsoft sending a clear message that playing games on Xbox and using Xbox services, including Game Pass, are no longer for people trying to save money on their annual gaming spend.</p>



<p>Removing a 10% discount is the kind of squeezing that, after a price hike for Game Pass, which followed a price hike of the Xbox Series consoles in the US (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">the second console price hike this year</a>), will only work to drive a bigger and bigger wedge between Xbox and its players. It's the kind of thing that leads people who have been with the Xbox platform since the beginning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-xbox-generation-will-be-remembered-for-one-thing-greed">to write features lambasting the greed Microsoft has shown</a>.</p>



<p>Pretty much everything coming out of Xbox lately has told players they will have to pay a premium to play games on Xbox. It's no wonder that after the console price hikes, Microsoft removing the ability for players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">redeem Microsoft Points towards Game Pass subs</a>, and of course, the price hike of Game Pass itself, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">players swarmed to Microsoft's website to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>



<p>Actual living essentials are already increasing and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">encouraging people to spend less on non-essential areas of their lives, like videogames</a>. The decision to leave Xbox and its services behind is made even easier when Microsoft is simultaneously raising prices and removing discounts.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, DOOM: The Dark Ages became the sixth PC game (not counting RTX remakes like those made for Quake II and Portal) to support real-time path tracing after Cyberpunk 2077, DESORDRE, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>id Software's latest entry in the DOOM franchise did not support the technology at launch. Still, a month later, on June 18, 2025, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-pc-performance-slaying-demons-never-looked-better-nvidia-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an update introducing path tracing and NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Both features significantly improved the game's visual quality and made it, alongside its excellent performance, a benchmark against which developers must compare their work.</p>



<p>This week, NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-id-software-used-neural-rendering-and-path-tracing-in-doom-the-dark-ages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a Q&amp;A with id Software's Director of Engine Technology</a>, Billy Khan, to discuss the studio's implementation of path tracing. According to Khan, it took the Texas-based studio around six months to implement the technology in their game. The programmer also shared the belief that more games will make the leap from ray tracing to path tracing in the coming years.  </p>



<p><em>Path tracing is now part of id Tech 8. We’ll continue research and development in this area. As with all technology, we evaluate its use on a per-game basis to ensure it meets the needs of the game and delivers value to players. I believe path tracing will continue to evolve and will be used in more games in the coming years. </em></p>



<p>Of course, game developers' adoption will likely accelerate if, as rumored, future AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-details-how-next-gen-udna-gpus-could-boost-ray-tracing-with-dense-geometry-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going to offer significant ray tracing optimizations</a>. Meanwhile, Khan mentioned NVIDIA's Opacity Micro-Maps and Shader Execution Reordering, the latter specifically, as highly helpful for optimization in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>



<p><em>For high-performance, visually complex scenes, optimizing both surface shading and transparency is crucial. Techniques that allow the GPU to intelligently reorder shading work and skip unnecessary calculations—like on pixels fully occluded by alpha-tested geometry—yield significant speedups. Both NVIDIA Opacity Micro-Map (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER) have been extremely useful for optimizing surface shading on the GPU. Some of our biggest optimizations for path tracing resulted from utilizing shader execution reordering.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Khan noted that DLSS RR really helped surface all the amazing details enabled by path tracing.</p>



<p><em>DLSS Ray Reconstruction added much-needed fidelity to denoising our path-traced results while preserving more detail. It’s a strong improvement in performance and quality over traditional denoising techniques. I’m excited to see further innovation here, which will empower more devices to play games with higher visual fidelity.</em></p>



<p>Did you play DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our game review is here</a>, by the way) with path tracing on? If so, what was your impression of id Software's implementation? </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-loses-out-to-modded-nintendo-switch-%E2%80%9Cpro%E2%80%9D-in-some-backward-compatible-games-comparison-shows.1315585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is considerably more powerful than its predecessor, but a recent online comparison shows the original Switch could have held its own better against the new console with a few key hardware tweaks.</p>



<p>The video comparison shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> compares loading speed, handheld and docked performance in multiple games, and battery life between the current generation Nintendo system and <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-playstation-3-games-rpcs3/">an overclocked modded "pro" version of a Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. The modded system's hardware includes an overclocked CPU (1707 MHz) and GPU (1724 MHz), 8 GB of RAM, an upgraded 8600 mAh battery, and modded cooling to prevent damage to the system.</p>



<p>While loading speed in games such as The Witcher 3, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is much faster on Nintendo Switch 2, the difference isn't massive in other games, such as Hogwarts Legacy. Even in terms of handheld and docked performance in backward-compatible games, the differences aren't huge. </p>



<p>In GRID Autosport in handheld mode, for example, the two systems are an almost complete match, with the Nintendo Switch 2 sporting better frametimes thanks to its more powerful CPU. Docked performance is also impressive on the modded Nintendo Switch, as Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at close to 60 FPS most of the time, although at a clearly lower resolution than the Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>In some unpatched games, however, the performance comparison between the two systems becomes more interesting. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the modded Nintendo Switch runs the game at smooth 60 FPS, as opposed to the locked 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. The modded system can run Metroid Prime Remastered at 1440p resolution while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. With Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the modded Nintendo Switch also has no trouble pushing the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, while the unpatched game on Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be locked at 30 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While comparing how unpatched backward compatible games run on the two systems may be a little unfair, the comparison shows how some design decisions, such as the limited amount of RAM, held back the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have similar constraints, and it shows, as it runs some PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports surprisingly well, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The new entry in the CAPCOM series, in particular, is setting out to be another benchmark release for the system, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">even the development team was surprised at how well the game runs on the system.</a></p>
