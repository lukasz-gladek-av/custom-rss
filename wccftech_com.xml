			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing fixes for a couple of specific issues while improving the system's stability.</p>



<p>The 21.0.1 update, which is also live for the original Nintendo Switch, addresses an issue that caused Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 to occur when attempting a system transfer from a Switch system to a Switch 2 system.</p>



<p>The new Nintendo Switch 2 system update also addresses an issue that prevented Bluetooth devices from connecting to the console after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode. This was a particularly annoying issue that forced the user to reboot the system, so this fix is particularly welcome.</p>



<p>Being a minor update, these seem to be the only changes introduced by the 21.0.1 update. You can find the official update notes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-update-version-21-0-1-released-november-24-2025">Switch 2 Update Version 21.0.1 (Released November 24, 2025)</h2>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Error Code: 2011-0301 or Error Code: 2168-0002 would repeatedly occur on a Nintendo Switch when attempting a system transfer using local communication from a Nintendo Switch system to a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes, after waking up the system from Sleep Mode or turning off Airplane Mode, wireless controllers or Bluetooth audio devices were unable to connect.</li>



<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the new Nintendo Switch 2 update is a minor update, some undocumented changes may have been introduced to the system. At the time of writing, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome">dedicated dataminer Oatmeal Dome</a> has yet to report any findings; however, we will update the post as soon as new information about the update is discovered.</p>



<p>The latest major Nintendo Switch 2 system update was update 21.0.0, which launched earlier this month. The update introduced changes to the HOME menu to indicate whether the software shown is a physical or digital release, the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the <em>"Use Online License" </em>setting is turned off, and more. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/43314">More information can be found on the Nintendo Support website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-would-like-shadowdrop-more-games-after-owning-the-day-with-oblivion-remastered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-would-like-to-shadowdrop-more-games-after-%E2%80%98owning-the-day%E2%80%99-with-oblivion-remastered.1363804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Bethesda Game Studios briefly captured the interest of many gamers with the mystery surrounding the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Rumors had swirled for months about it, but they did not confirm anything until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement and immediate release of Oblivion Remastered on April 22, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It was a veritable 'shadowdrop', an unusual marketing strategy where the developer and publisher do not market their product in advance but instead focus entirely on maximizing the surprise effect. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> during the recent Golden Joystick Awards, Bethesda Game Studios Director Tom Mustaine, who was in charge of the Oblivion remaster project as Director of External Projects (Virtuos handled the game's Unreal Engine 5 port), mentioned the previous shadowdrop of Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush as a successful test run and suggested the studio would like to do more.</p>



<p><em>We had a real successful shadowdrop with Hi-Fi Rush through Xbox and through Bethesda. Todd Howard, the boss man, he's wanted to shadowdrop things for a long time because it's so great to be able to say, 'Here's the thing, get it today.' It's very valuable.</em></p>



<p><em>We all have short attention spans now. There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy… I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the penchant of Bethesda Game Studios boss Todd Howard for shadowdrops is well known. Just recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he'd love for the studio's next highly anticipated game, The Elder Scrolls VI, to 'just appear' eventually once it is ready to ship to fans.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely Microsoft would agree to let them do this to such a massively anticipated title, sequel to one of the best-selling games of all time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Going with a more traditional marketing campaign would be the safest route, although perhaps a middle ground could be a Fallout 4-style reveal at E3 (now Summer Game Fest) and subsequent release in November. </p>



<p>A game that could be shadowdropped by Bethesda, similar to Oblivion Remastered, is the Fallout 3 remaster. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's in development alongside a remaster of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Far Cry TV Series by FX Is Now Official, Produced by Fargo Creator Noah Hawley]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-series-fx-now-official-produced-fargo-creator-noah-hawley/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/far-cry-tv-series-by-fx-is-now-official-produced-by-fargo-creator-noah-hawley.1363771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Three and a half months ago, Ubisoft briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the announcement of a Far Cry TV series adaptation on its official website before quickly removing it. Usually, this kind of mistake happens a few hours before the news is supposed to go live, but everything went silent afterward, prompting fans to wonder whether this project was still going forward.</p>



<p>That seems to be the case now. The blog post <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is once again live</a> and has stayed that way for a few hours. The details are largely the same: FX has placed an order for the series, which will follow an anthology format, where each season will feature a different setting and cast of characters. This is, after all, the same formula that has always been used in the Far Cry games, so it appears fitting.</p>



<p>It's also one that Noah Hawley, one of the two producers, is very familiar with, having successfully created the award-winning series Fargo. Hawley, who's also known for Legion and most recently for Alien: Earth, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.</em></p>



<p>Rob is the other producer, Rob Mac, whose birth name is Rob McElhenney. He's primarily famous as the creator of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, and Welcome to Wrexham, the latter being a documentary series focused on the Welsh football club Wrexham A.F.C. that he co-owns with Ryan Reynolds. In a statement, Rob Mac added:</p>



<p><em>Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized. Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.</em></p>



<p>The Far Cry series will also be executive produced by Emilia Serrano for 26 Keys, Nick Frenkel for 3 Arts, Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, John Campisi, and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>



<p>This FX adaptation joins a growing list of upcoming TV shows based on game IPs, including the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, Beyond: Two Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-disco-elysium-amazon-series-fallout-walton-goggins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disco Elysium</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a>, Pacific Drive, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfenstein</a>, in addition to ongoing successful series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/twisted-metal-tv-series-anthony-mackie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>



<p>Far Cry is one of the three big IPs that Ubisoft is focusing on with the new Vantage Studios subsidiary, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> a significant cash infusion from Tencent. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-2026-27-lineup-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, Ubisoft is busy with two projects based on the first-person shooter series: a full-fledged sequel and an extraction shooter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Charlie Cox Says Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Nominations for Gustave Should Be Credited to the Motion Actor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-should-be-credited-to-motion-actor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-for-gustave-should-be-credited-to-the-motion-actor.1363765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>British actor Charlie Cox was among those who received a nomination for their work on the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Cox, a renowned film and TV actor whose credits include Stardust, Boardwalk Empire, The Theory of Everything, Daredevil, Kin, and Treason, was featured for the first time in a videogame in the role of Gustave, a resourceful engineer with a mechanical arm. In a reaction to the nomination news, though, he noted that most of the credits for Gustave should really go to the motion actor instead of himself.</p>



<p>At a recent panel hosted during the Mexican convention LaConve 64 in Monterrey, as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Posta Entretenimiento</a>, Charlie Cox said:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination. I have said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role. So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time the actor has shrugged off the accolades that came his way for the role of Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Charlie Cox previously admitted that he's not a gamer, did not play the game, and only spent about four hours in the studio doing the voiceover after his agent signed him up for it, which now made him feel like a 'total fraud' when people praised him.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already won seven prizes at the Golden Joystick Awards</a>, including two for the performers (Jennifer English for Maelle and Ben Starr for Verso). It's set to win many more at The Game Awards and elsewhere throughout the award season.</p>



<p>As for Charlie Cox, fans are already wondering if he'll be in the already announced movie adaptation. He might have some competition from Glen Powell, though, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he played and loved the game.</p>
