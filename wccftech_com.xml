			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of the first video</a> in a series dedicated to the game's mechanics, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <span>also conducted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hPXEVG-X5g" target="_blank">an interview with Destin Legarie</a>, in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;discussed</span> the game's length.</p>



<p>Powers refused to provide a specific number, claiming that it only fostered negative discussion from both ends of the spectrum (those who don't have much time to play and those who have more free time). However, he did share some interesting tidbits: the <strong>main campaign is apparently just a very small percentage of the overall content available in Crimson Desert</strong>, and he said there's lots to do even after the main campaign is over. Furthermore, Powers added that <strong>he spent about 50 hours just on side activities</strong>, such as crafting. Overall, the game is "massive".</p>



<p><em>Respectfully, I dislike this question. I understand why it is asked, but players devour games in different ways. Some barrel through the main campaign immediately, but providing a specific number is difficult. If I give a large number, parents with limited time may feel discouraged or intimidated by the game. Conversely, students with more free time might find the same number too small. Regardless of the figure I provide, it feels like a losing proposition. I have been consistent in my refusal to provide a specific number, but <strong>I can say the game is massive</strong>. What I appreciate about it is the flexibility; you can choose what to do in each session based on your available time. There is a constant sense of progression and reward, even in the smallest activities.</em></p>



<p><em>Last week, I spent 50 hours playing the game. I sat down and played for 50 hours, focusing primarily on side content. I was not even fishing; I was mining, upgrading weapons, and testing mechanics. Since there is a set difficulty for all enemies, you can grind to overcome challenges through sheer willpower if you choose. This is an intended design choice. We never want a player to feel they must simply "get good" to proceed. If you invest time, you can beat everything. Alternatively, an incredibly skilled player could run right through it. The game should not prevent progression simply because a player does not understand a specific mechanic.</em></p>



<p><em>It is impossible to provide a definitive answer for open-world games because people rarely follow only the critical path. However, the main campaign represents only a small percentage of the overall content. For me, <strong>the game truly expanded after the credits. I realized I had barely scratched the surface of certain factions and their entire quest lines</strong>. Because I work on the game, I am aware of the available content, yet even after finishing the story, I realized I had missed entire areas because I was too focused on the main path. There is a vast amount of content to return to, including deep customization options and systems to invest time in. The developers' approach was to create an open world that encourages exploration. Their strength lies in creating emerging, immersive worlds where players can spend thousands of hours.</em></p>



<p>Crimson Desert is definitely one of the most anticipated games set to release in early 2026.

			<p>Japanese developer<strong> Game Freak</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the first proper look at their new franchise</a>, <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>, during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct Show 2026</strong>. Following that appearance, several gamers noted the <strong>apparent similarities with the Soulslike genre</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Famitsu</a>, Game Director <strong>Kota Furushima</strong> revealed <strong>several key differences</strong>, such as the design goal of making the game completable even for those who are not action game experts, and the ability for players to lower the difficulty. This is <strong>famously absent in most Soulslike games</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We're trying to make it so that even people who aren't good at action games can enjoy it. You can also choose the difficulty level, so if you're unsure, I think it's best to lower the difficulty level. Personally, I'd be happy if people could enjoy the game by taking an approach that actually lowers the difficulty level, by devising the skill tree system and Koo's support.</em></p>



<p>That's not to say there won't be times when you will be challenged in Beast of Reincarnation. Again, though, Furushima stressed that <strong>they're not trying to make a game where you're forced to fight a boss hundreds of times</strong>, which is practically a key component of a Soulslike game.</p>



<p><em>I think there will be times when you get defeated, and I want players to enjoy trial and error, trying different fighting styles next time, or changing Kuu's skills. However, I don't intend for players to never be able to clear the game on their first try, or to have to retry dozens or hundreds of times, so I hope that players will pick it up without being too scared.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Game Director confirmed that the protagonists, <strong>Emma the Sealer and Koo, each have three skill trees</strong>, enabling a variety of playstyles. For example, as well as close-range combat, you can attack with long-range weapons and perform stealth actions. There are also other ways to change your fighting style; while you can learn action-oriented skills, you can also acquire passive skills that simply boost Emma and Koo's stats or recovery rate.</p>



<p>Beast of Reincarnation is currently slated for a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> launch window on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>. Stay tuned for more details as the release date approaches.</p>
