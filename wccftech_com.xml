			<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is officially out next week, on September 25, 2025, but that official release date hasn't stopped physical copies of the game from finding their way out into the wild early. While physical copies of a racing game don't exactly mean big narrative spoilers are about to hit the wire the way it would for other titles getting out early, in this case, it does seem to mean the rest of the DLC collaborations SEGA had planned getting leaked early.</p>



<p>A photo of a postcard that came with physical copies of the game, which is stored inside the case, shows the remaining three collaborations that SEGA has yet to announce for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The image was posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1nkh9h8/so_about_the_final_unannounced_collab_dlc/">Sonic the Hedgehog Reddit</a>, revealing that the next three collaborations after the already announced Minecraft, Pac-Man, and Spongebob collaborations are: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar Legends, and Mega Man.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this doesn't necessarily reveal which characters from each of the above series will be included. The <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/racers.html">official website</a> for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds shows eight mystery spots in the roster of DLC characters. Half of those could be filled by the Turtles, but the image specifically lists TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, so we could see other characters beyond the four teenage turtles, and that's before mentioning that there might be a greater focus on including characters from the other three series.</p>



<p>At the very least, we know to expect new tracks, characters, and vehicles related to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Avatar Legends, and Megaman. Also, since this information was featured in a postcard coming with physical copies of the game that will be officially available in just a few days, it's likely we'll hear a proper announcement from SEGA regarding these DLC collaborations soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Wccftech's review</a> of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds from Nathan Birch, who writes, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-casting-calls-for-amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-series-stir-speculation-the-adaptation-will-feature-male-shepard.1302009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">Four years ago</a>, we first heard a report that Amazon was crossing the 't's on a deal with EA and BioWare to make a Mass Effect TV series adaptation. Now, we know the deal went through, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey</a> was tapped to write the show, followed by<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/"> Doug Jung</a> being selected to be its showrunner, and we've even had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">confidence-boosting confirmation</a> that the same production team of artists who excellently brought Fallout to life will also be working on Mass Effect.</p>



<p>All of that still leaves a whole pile of unanswered questions, but a recent leak might've just begun to answer one of the most major questions in the series: which Shepard will it be?</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-tv-series-casting-calls-leak-sparking-speculation-male-shepard-is-canon">Eurogamer</a>, entertainment reporter and insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669">Daniel Richtman</a> leaked five casting calls for Amazon's Mass Effect TV series. The calls don't explicitly say which character they're casting, but anyone familiar enough with the series can make educated guesses, and one of the calls points to Amazon choosing to go with Male Shepard for its iteration of the story.</p>



<p>The five calls are, per Eurogamer, "<em>a young Colin Farrell-type male (30-39) with open ethnicity, a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39), a female human providing a parallel narrative from Earth, a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60), and a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49).</em>"</p>



<p>Fans of the series have speculated that the 'male wrestler-type' is a casting call for James Vega, while the villain casting call points to Saren Arterius. The female co-lead is very likely a casting call for Liara T'Soni, while the other female casting call could be Emily Wong, a reworked version of Ashley Williams story, or a twin Shepard, by fans best approximations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, it's the first call listed that's causing the most ruckus, as fans are speculating that it is pointing to the show's lead, Commander Shepard, and casting for a male means Amazon has chosen to go with Mark Meer's Male Shepard over Jennifer Hale's FemShep.</p>



<p>When Casey spoke about having the Fallout production team work on Mass Effect earlier this year, he confirmed that the writer's room has been in full swing since the beginning of 2025. Which Shepard they would go with was likely one of the earliest decisions they made, so unless they restart the process, if fans are correct in their speculation for these casting calls, then we are locked in to the series featuring Male Shepard.</p>



<p>How that'll go over with fans remains to be seen, since there are plenty within the community who look to FemShep as the canon choice. The other side to this is that deciding which Shepard it'll be is only one of the many decisions that Casey and Jung will have to make that could alienate fans from the series. Which former BioWare lead writer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-show-criticized-bioware-lead-writer-david-gaider/">David Gaider, predicted would happen three years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In fairness, Gaider didn't need any prescient abilities to point out that some fans will dislike the decisions made for the coming adaptation, but as we learn more about the adaptation, it'll be interesting to see if by the time we're closing in on its premiere date, if it is starting on its back foot, needing to win over fans instead of successfully getting them excited for what's to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox Software has officially <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">communicated</a> with the community for the first time since launch. To start with, the studio thanked all those millions who purchased the games, indirectly confirming Alinea Analytics' report that <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 has already sold (at least) two million units</a> (and earned at least $150 million in revenue). Players have already looted 764 million items, driven 65 million kilometers, and beaten 55 million bosses, failing 7 million times.</p>



<p>The message then moved to address the main outstanding issues, such as performance and crashes, especially on PC. This is Gearbox's current top priority.</p>



<p><em>We're reading every piece of feedback you share. Some of the things we've already begun to take action on are: </em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. This is our top priority.</em></li>



<li><em>A Field of View (FOV) slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we're investigating those with planned updates coming.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Users have pointed out that this somewhat contradicts the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">counterclaims of Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford regarding performance in Borderlands 4</a>. Regardless, the studio as a whole has now declared its commitment to delivering 'an incredible experience'. Launch is just the beginning for the game, with two Story Packs and four Bounty Packs <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-endgame-post-launch-roadmap-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already planned for the next year</a>, in addition to several free updates. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Gearbox has shared a new SHiFT code that will provide access to the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 new Vault Hunter Skin usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li>



<li>1 Legendary Ripper Shield, which scales to your Vault Hunter's level (with a minimum of Lvl 25) when you redeem it via the Reward Center section of your Inventory screen, under Equipment.</li>



<li>2 ECHO-4 Drone Skins: "Break Free" and "Kn0x"</li>
</ul>
