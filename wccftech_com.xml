			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> revealed a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">now-canceled Black Panther game</a> from EA and Cliffhanger Studios. The report discusses a number of the challenges the game faced in its four years of development and some details about what the game would have included if it had been able to get across the finish line.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's report, EA's decision to cancel Black Panther and close Cliffhanger Games came down to the game not being far enough along in its development. Sources told Schreier that executives at EA were "<em>frustrated</em>" with the game still being in its pre-production phase, and that even though the game had recently gained some momentum, it was all seemingly too little too late in the minds of EA's top brass.</p>
<p>As to why development was moving at a slower pace, the report points to two key factors, the first being the fact that since Cliffhanger was only founded in 2021, the studio was still in the process of expanding and scaling its team to support the development of a big triple-A Black Panther game. The other falls to the studio's ambitions with the game, which was to create a system similar to Monolith's famous Nemesis system, and the issues that come with developing procedural narrative games, and then showcasing the game to executives.</p>
<p>According to the report, the game "<em>was to feature various playable heroes from the comic-book universe, such as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all competing for the mantle of Black Panther</em>," and that Marvel's infamous shapeshifting aliens, the Skrulls, would have been allies to the heroes.</p>
<p>However, as Skrulls are known to do, some would have posed as allies, and "<em>others might have remembered the player’s behavior and acted accordingly</em>," which is where similarities to the nemesis system come into play.</p>
<p>But the slow progress in the game's development and EA executives seemingly not being able to see how the game would shape up led to the news that was revealed earlier this week, and EA's third <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">mass layoff</a> this year alone.</p>
<p>Despite Black Panther being canceled, both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/">EA and Marvel claim that their relationship "<em>remains strong</em>,"</a> and that EA will still develop three games based on Marvel characters, the first being Motive's Iron Man game.</p>

			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-is-an-unreal-engine-5-action-adventure-game-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hell Is Us</a> developer Rogue Factor has <a href="https://x.com/HELLisUSgame/status/1928466441373716850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the full PC system requirements for their intriguing action/adventure roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but its requirements are even higher than what we've seen in most cases. According to the developers, you'll need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second on Ultra settings. This is already with upscaling enabled, too.</p>

<p>The good news is that everyone can test Hell Is Us for themselves very soon. Rogue Factor also announced that a demo will be released on Steam, where it will be playable between June 2 and 16. Console users won't get any demo due to 'technical constraints'.</p>
<p>The demo starts right at the beginning of the game. This introduction is designed to ease players into Hell is Us and its core gameplay systems. It won't reveal everything that the full game has to offer; Rogue Factor said that some of the key elements, such as exploration and the evolving player experience, are best appreciated as the world opens up and the layers unfold.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, the studio also discussed the game's difficulty settings. It's meant to be a challenging experience, but there will be tweakable settings. There are three preset levels, and players can also choose a more granular control, customizing things like enemy health, enemy damage, enemy aggressiveness, and death penalty.</p>
<p>Hell Is Us will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ZeniMax Workers United union, representing more than 300 quality assurance developers working at ZeniMax Media under Microsoft, has reached a tentative deal after two years of negotiating.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) calls it a "<em>historic</em>" agreement. The ZeniMax Workers United-CWA is the first union formed after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">Microsoft agreed</a> to take a neutral stance on its employees' unionizing when it was trying to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, to have a deal, even a tentative one, in place.</p>
<p>This deal also comes almost two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted to authorize strike powers</a> for its negotiating committee. When the ZWU-CWA voted to authorize strike powers, representatives of the union voiced their displeasure with Microsoft dragging its feet at the bargaining table, with union member Zachary Armstrong saying "<em>None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is</em>."</p>
<p>The ZWU-CWA did just that and, according to the press release, negotiated a tentative deal that includes "<em>substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers.</em> " It also includes "<em>protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,</em>" said ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and senior QA tester Page Branson. "<em>Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn't a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after</em>."</p>
<p>Fellow ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and QA tester Jessee Leese added, "<em>Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We're the ones who make these games, and we'll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment</em>."</p>
<p>Now that a tentative deal has been reached, it is expected to be ratified by June 20, according to the ZWU-CWA. Once that's done, it'll officially be the beginning of a new era for QA workers at ZeniMax. After that, the other unions that have formed under Microsoft since it signed a union neutrality agreement that do not have a deal in place are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA</a>, <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild-CWA</a>.</p>
