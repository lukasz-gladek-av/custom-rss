			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's latest DLC expansion, Legacy of the Forge, is now out across all platforms, alongside a new patch for the game from Warhorse Studios, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/patch-14">Update 1.4</a>, which includes several quality of life changes, balancing tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>



<p>The DLC's release also came with a new trailer, showcasing a bit more of the new storyline that players will be able to delve and forge their own path into. </p>

<p>The new DLC sees Henry join the Kuttenberg Blacksmith Guild, following in his adoptive father's footsteps by not only taking up smithing, but by attempting to complete what his adoptive father, Martin, could not. Fix the town's broken astronomical clock.</p>



<p>As Henry embarks on the journey to fix the clock and repair his adoptive father's legacy, he brings Martin's colleagues back together to get the job done. Along the way, the forge becomes a new home for players and for Henry, as you're able to decorate and build out your workshop, living quarters, and nearly every inch of the forge to your liking. </p>



<p>The expansion adds at least 15 more hours of game time for players who've rinsed everything else that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to offer. While Update 1.4 adds a few welcomed balance tweaks, like halbreds being "<em>twice as durable</em>" now, and increased quality for the Trollbane hammer.</p>



<p>If you've purchased the Gold Edition of the game or the Expansion Pass, then all you need to do is update Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to start playing the DLC. Otherwise, you'll have to grab it separately for Â£11.49.</p>
