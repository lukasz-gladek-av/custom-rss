			<p>It seems like Red Dead Online is suddenly getting some new content, and it's also zombie-themed. The update set to go live later today at 5 AM Eastern Time will <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> the so-called Strange Tales of the West, a set of four new Telegram missions where players will aid author Theodore Levin in investigating the unknown. They'll be able to track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more by collecting Mr. Levin’s letter from any Post Office or their Camp’s Lockbox, or simply by launching Telegram Missions from the Player Menu.</p>



<p>Telegram Missions, including the new Strange Tales of the West, are paying out 3X Gold, RDO$, and XP. Naturalists also reap rewards with 3X RDO$ and XP on Sample Sales, 3X Role XP and XP on Legendary Animal Sighting Missions, and 2X RDO$ and XP on Wildlife Photography. Here's a full list of the Red Dead Online bonuses planned for the month of July:</p>

<p>Red Dead Online never really took off as much as GTA Online did. Arguably, the much slower pace worked well for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single player masterpiece that is Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, but not nearly as well in online multiplayer. It's been three years since Rockstar openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-online-support-seemingly-slowing-down-to-focus-on-gta-vi-and-gta-online/">acknowledged</a> that they would focus more on making content for the much more successful GTA Online, and it's been a while since RDO got anything new, which is why its fans are now positively surprised. Plus, the zombie theme certainly appears to be a nod to Undead Nightmare, the acclaimed expansion released for the first Red Dead Redemption game.</p>

			<p>If you regularly browse Amazon US, you might have noticed that some Nintendo products sold directly by Amazon have seemingly disappeared from the online store. Now, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTMzNDU2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxOTM5MzY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWURHWDRUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.E71nPDnc5HCRuSL_hpDTIu53pBJ6k8Jxef68-H6UgOs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a report on why that's happened.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, the issue presented itself when Nintendo noticed that certain third-party sellers on Amazon were undercutting official products. They would essentially purchase the products in Southeast Asia, where they were presumably cheaper, and then sell them in the United States via Amazon.</p>



<p>In an attempt to reassure Nintendo, Amazon offered to attach labels to products to guarantee their authenticity. However, the proposal wasn't deemed enough of an assurance to Nintendo, and the Japanese company ultimately decided to remove its products from Amazon in the US.</p>



<p>When Bloomberg asked Amazon for a comment prior to publishing the story, a spokesperson simply commented, “The claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate,” without providing any further details on the subject.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the fact remains that the issue prevented Amazon from participating in the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling console in history</a> with its over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days since the launch date (June 6), going <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe. </p>



<p>What's perhaps even more impressive is that even without selling directly on Amazon US, by far the biggest online store in the country, the Nintendo Switch 2 still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> 1.1 million units across the United States in the launch week, beating the record previously established by Sony's PlayStation 2 in October 2000. By the way, Nintendo products (Switch 2 included) are regularly available in several countries, such as Japan itself, the United Kingdom and Canada. However, Amazon US makes up two-thirds of the store's global sales.</p>
