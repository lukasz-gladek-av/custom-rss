<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility feature is looking more interesting than expected before launch, as it manages to fix the massive performance issues of Batman Arkham Knight, one of the worst ports released for its predecessor.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-back-compat-fixes-batman-arkham-knight-switch-1s-worst-triple-a-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the new-generation system from Nintendo, which has launched worldwide today, runs the horrible port of the third main entry in the series developed by Rocksteady without the massive performance issues it has on the original system. As such, the translation layer that is being used on the new system to run the original code has proven to be effective, allowing the game to put the better specs of the Switch 2 to good use. Ultimately, there's no fixing for the compromises the port's developer had to make in terms of texture quality and lack of antialiasing, and there are still some stability issues, but the fact that the Switch 2 can brute force better performance in backward-compatible titles is quite promising.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid game, Batman Arkham Knight has been somewhat infamous since its release due to the horrible state it launched in on PC, which required multiple patches to fix. The late Nintendo Switch port of the game, which launched last year, is equally infamous for being absolutely terrible, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">running at a whopping 0 FPS in certain scenarios.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally launched worldwide, but not everyone is having a good release day. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-here-and-for-some-players-their-consoles-are-already-damaged-thanks-to-stores-stapling-holes-into-the-switch-2-screen/">earlier today</a>, some early adopters found their unit's screen damaged because store employees stapled their receipts in front of the console's box.</p>
