			<p>Atlus has announced that an extensive Persona 3 Reload demo is now available on all platforms. The demo allows would-be players to play through the story’s opening, leading up to the first major boss battle against a Shadow. It's a section of several hours, making it a rather meaty demo compared to the usual half-hour slice. Moreover, as usual with demos nowadays, you can play through the whole thing and then continue where you left off after you purchase the game.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload launched in early 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 9 out of 10</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Persona 3 Reload is gorgeous; it looks like one of the more modern Persona titles, and it manages to bring this new visual overhaul without sacrificing what is one of the darker atmospheres you'll find in a game like this. It adds a fresh feel to the game while still keeping it familiar, which is something all remakes/reloads could remember to do. From brand-new models and portraits to new menus, ATLUS hasn't skimped.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I want to say it plays immaculately on the Steam Deck. There are no hiccups; it is smooth, responsive, and looks fantastic. Overall, Persona 3 Reload is precisely as my title says: "a remake as it should be". Yes, aspects are missing from previous versions, so you couldn't arguably call this a definitive edition of Persona 3. Still, in my opinion, it's undoubtedly the best version of Persona 3 you'll find.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the game's debut, Atlus <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it was the fastest-selling game in the whole Persona franchise. We know it has sold one million copies in its first week, though there haven't been any updated sales figures since.</p>

			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods released online this week introduce some custom quests that allow hunters to fight against a monster that has yet to be officially available in the game.</p>
<p>The first of these new mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1678?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Event Quests</a>, which introduces four challenging custom quests against an Alpha Doshaguma and its pack, Zoh Shia, Arkveld, and Arch-tempered Rey Dau, a new powerful variant of the apex predator of the base game, which is already included in the game files, and will only be made available officially later this month. Some of these quests feature some illegal values that could create issues down the line if CAPCOM decides to crack down on this type of mod, so beware.</p>
<p>The second Monster Hunter Wilds custom quests mod that's now available online is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1686?tab=description">Arena All Monsters Permanent Quest</a>, which adds custom Event Quests for all monsters currently available in the game, including the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, except for Jin Dahaad and Zoh Shia, which do not work properly in the Wounded Hollow arena due to their unique mechanics. As for the Custom Event Quests mod, using this mod could lead to issues down the line.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-get-zoh-shia-investigations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-010-00-00-full-patch-notes-revealed/"> major update</a> introduced a lot of new features to the game, as well as new content in the form of a new monster to hunt, the returning monster Mizutsune and the highly-anticipated high rank Zoh Shia hunt, which is one of the most challenging fights in the game to date. As per series tradition, a hard hunt is rewarded with monster parts that can be used to craft powerful gear.</p>
<p>After you have defeated high rank Zoh Shia in the Germination quest, you will likely want to fight the powerful monster again to get more of its parts to craft its excellent gear. The easiest way to fight the high rank variant of the campaign's final boss is to take advantage of the SOS Flare mechanics. Any time while not in a hunt, speak with Alma, select the <strong>SOS Flare Quests</strong> tab in the Quests menu, and select Zoh Shia as the target. Chances are you will find plenty of quests with some openings, although it may take some time to join a quest as these tend to fill up rather quickly.</p>

<p>The second option to fight against high rank Zoh Shia again after taking it down the first time in Monster Hunter Wilds is by unlocking <strong>Zoh Shia Investigations</strong> in your game world, and doing so is simple enough, if you know where to look. The powerful monster can only appear in the <strong>Ruins of Wyveria</strong> during the season of <strong>Inclemency</strong>. As such, getting a Zoh Shia Investigation requires you to head over to the Ruins of Wyveria, enter your tent, change the Season to Inclemency, rinse and repeat until Zoh Shia appears, of which you will be notified in-game the same way you are notified about the appearance of other apex predators like Jin Dahaad and Rey Dau. At this point, you can already save the newly available hunting quest as an Investigation, which you can replay three times. If these three times are not enough to get all the parts you need, you will simply have to repeat the process above to make Zoh Shia appear again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-1-0-2-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing plenty of new features and improvements, including PSSR support on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The introduction of support for the AI-powered upscaler that made its debut with the mid-generation refresh system last year is accompanied by the introduction of Raytraced Specular in Balanced Mode, bringing this display mode's visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro Quality Mode than Performance Mode. Those playing the game for the first time on PlayStation 5 Pro with the 1.0.2 patch will have PSSR enabled by default, but everyone else will have to enable it in the video tab of the pause menu.</p>
<p>After the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch went live, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> released a comparison video that highlights how PSSR adds some improvements to image quality with better antialiasing. However, its implementation still isn't perfect, as there's a loss in sharpening and reflections, which has been seen in other games as well.</p>

<p>The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch, as mentioned above, also introduces other changes and improvements, such as horse auto-follow and speed improvements, the ability to reset Master Nodes straight from the menu, selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to toggle between dynamic resolution scaling and fixed resolution mode regardless of upscaler quality on PC and more.
