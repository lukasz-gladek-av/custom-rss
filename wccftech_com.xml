			<p>It's been a while since we heard any news about Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra. The action/adventure game in development at Skydance New Media and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to be published by Plaion</a> should launch this year, but there have been no further details on the release timing, and some fans have been worried about a delay.</p>
<p>According to Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton, though, the team is still doing its best to release it this Holiday season. <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to The Direct</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited. To be playing him in the video game, playing his grandfather, be playing a version of Black Panther, and looking on there and seeing that it's me… It's like the most photo realistic… We want people to play this game and have the entire family, sit on the sofa and watch it like they're watching 'Game of Thrones,' or 'The Walking Dead,' or something. We’re looking for just an incredible cinematic experience for everybody, and I pinch myself.</em></p>
<p>Payton is definitely right about the game's photorealism. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals during Epic's Unreal Engine GDC 2024 live stream.</p>
<p>The development team is helmed by none other than Amy Hennig, who's renowned in the industry for her work on Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver, Uncharted, and Battlefield: Hardline. She was famously developing the Star Wars game codenamed Project Ragtag at Visceral Games before the studio was shut down and the project canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in September 2022, Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra is set in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II. It involves Steve Rogers (Captain America) forming an uneasy alliance with Azzuri (Black Panther), the king of Wakanda. Other playable characters include Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Nanali, leader of the Wakandan Spy Network.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could bring back the dual-screen experience of previous Nintendo consoles like the DS and 3DS, judging from a recently discovered accessory patent.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-phone-holder-attachment-magnetic-tech-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameRant,</a> Nintendo recently patented a sort of connection structure that can rotate around a magnetic connection point. The patent explicitly mentions a smartphone holder as one of the accessories that could be compatible with this design, suggesting that the company is at least considering bringing back a dual-screen experience in some form. Even if this accessory wouldn't have any actual in-game application, it could still be somewhat useful for those who, for example, want to have game guides quickly available while playing games. Still, as Nintendo files a lot of patents that never get turned into actual products, there's no way to know if the Japanese company will indeed bring back the dual-screen experiences that worked quite well with the DS and 3DS, but not so much with the Wii U.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-anticipated reveal&nbsp;<span>in January, very little has been said about the Nintendo Switch 2. Some new images shared last month provided a new look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dock</a>&nbsp;and the console's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charger</a>, but it's becoming clearer than ever that the most important information on the system will only come during the Nintendo Direct, which</span>&nbsp;will air on April 2nd.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches sometime this year worldwide.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> A June release is likely</a>, according to a former Nintendo employee.</p>
