			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>

<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em><br>
<em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration.</em><br>
<em>Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em><br>
<em>- Account suspension</em><br>
<em>- In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em><br>
<em>- No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em><br>
<em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>
<p>This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a>, which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>
<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>
<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>
<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>
<li>Required to comply with COPPA, including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</em></p>
<p>The popular free-to-play action RPG <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being updated today to patch 5.6</a>. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A combination of leaks has provided the first look at the Asus ROG Ally 2 and the Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Project Kennan. Indonesian publication 91Mobiles <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a certification for a new ASUS handheld at the local certification company for two different models: the RC73XA and the RC73YA.</p>
<p>With the model numbers, this was subsequently linked <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Twitter user Huang514613</a> to a United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing that included pictures of both models. The white one seems to be the regular Asus ROG Ally 2, while the black one appears to feature an Xbox button and could therefore be the Xbox branded handheld.</p>

<p>The same Twitter user also <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919970354363064533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> some of the specifications from the back labels. The RC73YA should be equipped with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-preps-faster-aerith-plus-soc-higher-clocks-lpddr5x-possibly-for-steam-deck-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's AERITH Plus</a>, a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and up to 20 watts of TDP. The RC73XA, on the other hand, is reportedly more powerful, being equipped with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme, an 8-core CPU, 32GB of RAM, and up to 35 watts of TDP.</p>
<p>There have been rumors that Asus <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had partnered with Microsoft</a> to make an&nbsp;<span>Xbox-branded handheld. Later, Asus teased that they were 'cooking' something new, and the Xbox social channel&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-keenan-teases-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> with a not-at-all-subtle</span>&nbsp;meme hinting that it would be about Xbox.</p>
<p>This portable device made in collaboration with Asus will be just a stepping stone in Microsoft's handheld plans. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> by Windows Central, a proper Microsoft-made Xbox handheld will debut in 2027 alongside the successor to the Xbox Series X, featuring direct-to-cloud connectivity, among other things.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in a talk at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem Jason Ronald <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated </a>that the goal of the future Xbox handheld is to combine the best of the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) ecosystems for an optimal user experience.</p>
