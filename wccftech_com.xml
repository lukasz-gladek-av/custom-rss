			<p>Acclaim, a US-based video game publisher who you'd recognize for its success in the 1990s with games like Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Turok, NBA Jam, and a suite of movie licensed games under its belt is <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">back from the dead</a> after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. The publisher is making a grand return with its own PlayAcclaim showcase series debuting in two weeks time, on September 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Titled "<em>A New Era is Coming</em>," this showcase is set to include the publisher's "<em>upcoming lineup of titles while celebrating the brand's unforgettable legacy</em>." There are even hints at what'll be revealed, and how Acclaim is going to kickstart its comeback, according to a press release, that eagle-eyed viewers can spot in the teaser trailer released today.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Acclaim is now led by Alex Josef, who prior to being the chief executive officer of this new iteration of Acclaim was the chief executive officer of publisher <a href="https://www.graffitigames.com/">Graffiti Games</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We're not here to chase ghosts,</em>" Josef said in a press release. "<em>We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what's coming through is something exciting and different. You can't rewrite the past, but you can build upon it. This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh</em>."</p>



<p>Though this new iteration of Acclaim won't be publishing the Mortal Kombat games anymore, it'll be interesting to see what it adds to the modern videogame landscape, and for fans of the games the Acclaim used to publish, perhaps we'll see a few more series get a resurrection of their own. </p>



<p>We'll see what Josef and his team have in store in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skate Will Launch in Early Access in Three Weeks]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-will-launch-in-early-access-in-three-weeks.1281006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that Skate will launch in early access three weeks from now on September 16, 2025, bringing years of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-pre-pre-pre-alpha-signups-insider-program-testing/">closed playtesting</a> and waiting to an end. It'll be available to download for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/">confirmed</a> that we'd get the early access release date announced and the game's cover art revealed today, with both arriving in a short trailer showing off some gameplay and introducing players to San Vansterdam.</p>

<p>The fourth entry in EA's Skate series has been long-awaited, with 15 years between Skate 3's 2010 release and this new Skate game from Full Circle. Of course, it looks very different than the trilogy of games that skateboarding fans fell in love with between 2007-2010.</p>



<p>This new Skate is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">free-to-play live service game</a>, that will feature cosmetic microtransactions and require that <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players always be online</a> if they want to hop into San Vansterdamn. It's Skate for the modern video game landscape, or more accurately, it's the only iteration of Skate that EA believes is worth making in today's video game landscape, as EA ignores the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk remasters</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Skate is not just a return, it's a complete evolution of the franchise that's built to last,</em>" said the game's executive producer, Mike McCartney, in a press release. "<em>Our goal with Skate is to capture the freedom, creative expression and community of skateboarding, and share it with as many people as possible. From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future - one built in partnership with our players</em>."</p>



<p>While many players might not be on board with a Skate game that's potentially more focused on selling you a new colorway for your board than it is on making a good game, the fact that this is an early access release does at least mean, to some degree, Full Circle and EA will create the experience alongside player feedback. And, so long as Full Circle is able to nail the gameplay, you should be able to ignore all the live service filler you didn't ask for in your Skate game.</p>



<p>"<em>Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;</em><em>skate</em>," added the game's head of creative, Jeff Seamster. "<em>From day one, we've aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We've built this game alongside our community - listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you're a seasoned skater or just dropped in, Skate is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers - just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we're hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Skate's early access, free-to-play journey begins in a few weeks time. Hopefully, it's a strong enough start that we're not hearing about Skate being unceremoniously shut down in less than a few years time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the first major NASCAR game since 2021, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3873970/NASCAR_25/">NASCAR 25</a>, which is due out in October, will produce and develop a series on IndyCar racing games for PC and consoles, with the first of this new series coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a press release on iRacing Studios' <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026/">official website</a>, as iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations and IndyCar have signed "<em>a long-term licensing agreement for iRacing Studios to produce standalone INDYCAR titles for console and PC.</em>"</p>



<p>We don't yet have an official title for this new series, but its significance for racing fans cannot be overstated, as it's the first major IndyCar racing game "<em>in more than two decades</em>," according to iRacing and INDYCAR.</p>



<p>"<em>INDYCAR fans have long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles, and we're excited to give them what they're looking for in 2026,</em>" said iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations president, Tony Gardner. "<em>iRacing Studios' standalone INDYCAR title will offer all the excitement of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy. We are already very excited about how the game is coming together."</em></p>



<p>IndyCar president J. Douglas Boles added, "<em>The most competitive and challenging racing on the planet deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience. iRacing Studios is the ideal partner for us, trusted and known to our core fans and ready to share our sport with a wider and highly engaged audience.</em>"</p>



<p>According to the press release, this new game will include licensed vehicles and drivers from the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and INDY NXT, featuring online multiplayer, a career mode for players to progress through, and will be made on iRacing Studios' proprietary Orontes game engine.</p>



<p>"<em>Our company has grown significantly in recent years with the addition of new development teams and studios,</em>" Gardner continued. "<em>Our INDYCAR title will benefit from this growth as it will be the sole focus of one of these teams. However, the game will also incorporate elements like car and track assets, technology and driving characteristics from other iRacing Studios products</em>."</p>



<p>iRacing has always been more simulation than arcade focused, so it's not exactly trying to take away players from games like Forza Horizon, but it'll be interesting to see how this new IndyCar game fares when it arrives, and how its coming NASCAR 25 game does in October. It definitely feels like there's more of an interest in the overall sport of racing with major films recently released on the subject, even if they're not IndyCar or NASCAR-focused. We'll see what October 2025, and then 2026, has in store for racing fans.</p>
