			<p>We might be mere hours before the announcement and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914036912509407602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Detective Seeds</a> (the post has now been removed <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914046038907772973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at someone's request</a>), the game could launch tomorrow at 12 PM Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the excited community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k3kq3i/page_on_virtuous_website_for_oblivion_remastered/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found traces</a> on the Bing search engine of a dedicated game page on the website of Virtuos, the studio behind the remaster.&nbsp; Whether it's really coming out tomorrow or not, multiple insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concur</a> that Oblivion Remastered should shadow drop sometime in the coming week. Let's recap its history of leaks and rumors, then.</p>
<p>In September 2023, an internal document shared as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft trial <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda planned to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 remaster, which, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-3-remaster-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is further away from release</a>, according to the latest rumors).</p>
<p>After well over a year of no further info, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report in January 2025</a> (based on the resume of a former Virtuos employee) not only discovered that Oblivion Remastered was indeed coming, but also revealed a lot of its features. It would be powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and it would feature improvements in six key areas: HUD (Heads-Up Display), Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, and Hit Reactions. Earlier this week, the first screenshots were found online on a Virtuos webpage, previewing the massive graphics improvements that players will be able to witness.</p>
<p>Now that the remaster is nearly official, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a comment from Rebelzize</a>, Project Leader of the total conversion mod Skyblivion, also scheduled to launch in 2025 after nearly a decade of work in the team's spare time. Rebelzize maintained a positive outlook, focusing on the experience gained and on the project's uniqueness instead:</p>
<p><em>Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Are you eager to step back into Cyrodiil once again? If so, do you plan to play the official remaster or the fan-made one? Let us know below!</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>
