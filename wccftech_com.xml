			<p>Just under a week after VOID Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/void-interactives-ready-or-not-coming-to-consoles-in-summer-2025/">announced</a> that Ready or Not would be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the tactical FPS hit another milestone by surpassing <strong>9 million copies sold</strong> on PC.</p>
<p>"<em>Our flagship tactical shooter Ready or Not is hitting a huge new milestone: We're officially coming to PlayStation and Xbox this summer</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>As we approach 10 million units sold on Steam, we're beyond excited to bring the experience to console players worldwide.</em>"</p>
<p>There's still no specific release date for Ready or Not on consoles, but we know it will be sometime during summer 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X | S)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?start=15&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ready or Not is a tactical FPS that puts you in the boots of a SWAT team where, unlike plenty of other shooters, you're trying to not pull the trigger as much as possible, instead of going in guns blazing for every situation.</p>
<p>The realistic scenarios Ready or Not emphasize to players that they need to strategize as much as possible. It's not your average war-shooter or Call of Duty, where the aim is to kill everyone in sight. A successful mission in Ready or Not means you've apprehended all hostile combatants and ensured everyone in harm's way gets out safely and alive.</p>
<p>Ready or Not originally launched in early access in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a> before reaching its full 1.0 release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">2023</a>. This release came after a few delays, with the full release being first scheduled for 2020. Now that it's due to arrive on consoles two years after its full PC release, VOID Interactive's long journey with Ready or Not will enter its next chapter.</p>
<p>The console version of Ready or Not will arrive with 20 missions that can be tackled solo or in co-op with up to five players. Two brand-new missions will also be available in the console version, which PC players will receive the same day as the console launch in a free update.</p>
<p>It'll also include two DLC expansions, which add another six missions to the pile. Those who pre-order the console version will have access to the M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, and 590M Shotgun. Once again, PC players who already own the game will get these weapons in a free update.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei will launch in early October on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, a new trailer shared today confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg&amp;t=2s">The new trailer</a>, which can be watched below, confirmed the game will launch on the current generation PlayStation consoles on October 2nd worldwide. Besides confirming the release date, the new trailer also provides a new look at the Yotei Six, gang members that Atsu has sworn to hunt down. Needless to say, the game is looking great and is a considerable step up from Ghost of Tsushima, which was originally released on PlayStation 4 and was later ported to PlayStation 5 and PC to offer improved visuals and more.</p>

<p>Following the release of the new Ghost of Yotei trailer, a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/">official PlayStation blog</a> confirmed that pre-orders will begin next week on May 2nd at 10:00 AM local time. Besides the standard edition, which will cost $69.99 USD / £69.99 / €79.99 / ¥8,980 and include a copy of the game and some pre-order bonuses like a unique in-game mask and seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and other members of the Yotei Six, players will also be able to pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will cost $79.99 / £79.99 / €89.99 / ¥9,980 and include in-game bonuses like The Snake armor, an alternate dye for the starting armor, early unlock of Traveler's Maps and more.</p>
<p>Also available for pre-order from May 2nd will be the Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition, which will include all the bonuses available in the other editions of the game as well as a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask, a replica of Atsu's sash, a replica of the Tsuba from Atsu's katana and a pouch of coins and instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game that will also be played in the game.
