			<p>After revealing who will be stepping into the role of <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Kratos</strong> in <strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> adaptation yesterday</a>, the company is back with another reveal today for one of its other video game adaptation TV series. This time, it's not a casting reveal, but more of a costume reveal, as we have our first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong> as one of video games' most iconic characters, <strong>Lara Croft</strong>, for the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> series.</p>



<p>"<em>Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way</em>," reads the caption of the post on the official <a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011800568835051933">Prime Video X (formerly Twitter)</a> account that first showed off Turner's new look. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Turner was confirmed to be the latest actress stepping into the role <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">back in September 2025</a>, at which point Amazon also confirmed that filming for the series would begin sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. Just last week, several more casting choices were announced, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-show-adds-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-to-the-cast/">including <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> as Lara's uncle, and <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong></a> as a mysterious new character who is looking to put Lara's unique set of skills to use.</p>



<p>The rest of the cast is rounded out by <strong>Martin Bobb-Semple, Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson, Paterson Joseph, Sasha Luss, Juliette Motamed, Celia Imrie </strong>and<strong> August Wittgenstein</strong>, all of whom  (save for Peterson, Isaacs, and Bobb-Semple) are playing brand new characters in the series.</p>



<p>This is the same adaptation that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">first announced back in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, with the award-winning <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong> signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series. Hopefully, as filming starts later this year, we'll begin to learn more about the story and the approach the adaptation is taking with the show.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-quarantine-the-last-check-star-wars-outlaws-guild-wars-reforged/</link>
            <guid>1407067</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After announcing several of the titles that'll be joining <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> throughout the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/">month of <strong>January 2026</strong> right at the start of the new year</a>, we have <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-quarantine-zone/">a new batch of games revealed today</a> for yet another GeForce NOW Thursday that will be joining the service. Some, like <strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</strong>, which leads the group this week, have previously been announced. Others, like <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</strong>, are new reveals joining NVIDIA's cloud streaming service.</p>



<p>This week's new batch of games sees a total of <strong>nine titles</strong> entering the GeForce NOW library, including the aforementioned three titles, the first two games in the <strong>Styx</strong> franchise, both of which will be free on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> starting today, <strong>Guild Wars: Reforged</strong>, and <strong>Tavern Keeper</strong>.</p>



<p>The headliner for this week, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, is the latest game published by renowned indie publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, the team known for publishing the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-december-2025-games/">Skate Story</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</a></strong> and <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong>, to name a few. It sees you stepping into the shoes of a checkpoint officer, scanning people into the Quarantine Zone, acting as the last line of defense for the people in the zone. If you mistakenly let someone sick into the zone, you could set the plague loose on an already crumbling society.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check<em> </em>(New release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, Jan. 12, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (Ubisoft Connect, now available on Xbox Game Pass)</li>



<li>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon (New release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, Jan. 15)</li>



<li>Styx: Shards of Darkness (New release on <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/styx-shards-of-darkness-77c030?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, free on Jan. 15)</li>



<li>Styx: Master of Shadows<em> </em>(New release on <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/styx-master-of-shadows-4d9ab3?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, free on Jan. 15)</li>



<li>Guild Wars: Reforged (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29720?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou<em> </em>(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520370?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>)</li>



<li>Waterpark Simulator (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293260?utm_source=nvidia&amp;utm_campaign=geforce_now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>As we noted at the start of the year, we still have no word on some of January's bigger releases, like <strong>Code Vein II</strong>, joining the service. There's still time, though, before its release at the end of the month, so hopefully, we'll see it added either later in the month or at least sometime soon this year.</p>



<p>If you're looking forward to Code Vein II, you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out our preview of the upcoming Souslike from Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto</a>. For even more on the game, Kai and Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to speak with the game's producer, <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong> and director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/">and you can read that interview here</a>. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-rumors-just-got-resurrected-by-arenanet-job-ad/</link>
            <guid>1407031</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In March 2024, NCSOFT Acting Chairman <strong>Park Byeong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let it slip</a> during an investor meeting that Bellevue-based subsidiary <strong>ArenaNet</strong> had already started working on <strong>Guild Wars 3</strong>. Of course, the studio was not ready for a proper announcement yet, so its response was that they were focused on new <strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> updates and expansions (which have been released annually since 2023). Not a confirmation, but crucially, not a denial, either.</p>



<p>Nearly two years later, <strong><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/arenanet/jobs/7536965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new job ad</a></strong> was spotted by the Internet sleuths from Reddit, reigniting discussions around the project. The ad seeks a 'Contract Senior Writer/Narrative Designer' for an unannounced project, so definitely not for new Guild Wars 2 content. The most interesting part, though, is where ArenaNet details the expertise that the would-be employee needs to have: <strong>MMOs</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. The former is another hint that they are indeed talking about Guild Wars 3, or whatever the next installment in the series will be called, and the latter suggests <strong>the studio might switch from its proprietary engine to Epic's game-making technology</strong>. </p>



<p>Here's a full list of what you'll need to actually have a chance, just in case anyone reading might be looking to apply:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bachelor’s degree in literature, creative writing, screenwriting, or related field or an equivalent combination of education, training, and experience.</em></li>



<li><em>5 years of experience as a professional writer or copyeditor, with applicable portfolio samples, including <strong>2 years of experience developing MMORPGs</strong> and open-world games</em></li>



<li><em>Experience shipping one or more AAA-quality product(s) or nongame equivalent(s), in a writing or editing capacity.</em></li>



<li><em>Understanding of general writing and narrative design concepts</em>.</li>



<li><em>Dramatic writing skills, preferably in writing for games and at least one other narrative medium (e.g., screenwriting, playwriting, prose, etc.)</em>.</li>



<li><em>Copyediting skills</em>.</li>



<li><em>Practical and philosophical editing/writing knowledge</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of breaking serialized stories at the season and episode levels</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of or experience in interactive and non-linear storytelling, using non-traditional and non-verbal delivery systems (e.g., environmental storytelling, in-engine storytelling without cutscenes, etc.)</em></li>



<li><em>Knowledge of character creation, story arc design, and dialogue writing</em>.</li>



<li><em>Able to learn and use proprietary tools to create content.</em></li>



<li><em>Familiar with gameplay systems</em>.</li>



<li><em><strong>Experience using Unreal Engine</strong>.</em></li>



<li><em>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</em></li>



<li><em>Excellent organizational skills.</em></li>



<li><em>Able to work independently and in a team</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of and ability to use&nbsp;The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.</li>



<li><em>Familiar with video game narratives, <strong>preferably MMOs</strong>.</em></li>



<li><em>Familiar with narrative game systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>ArenaNet has been posting job ads about a new online game since 2022, so it might not be long until the studio shares something in an official capacity, but there's no telling exactly when. Still, given the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near-complete absence of new triple-A Western MMORPGs</a></strong>, Guild Wars 3 might be the only hope on the horizon.</p>

<p>The game's launch, however, was only the beginning. Following Season 1 which brought back both fan favorites like Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi and iconic characters from the Street Fighter series like Ken and Chun-Li, Season 2 will bring even more iconic characters like Wolfgang Krauser, Blue Mary and Kim Jae Hoon, as well as two mystery characters - one<a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/2009414900343558604"><strong> teased to be none other than <em>Kenshiro</em> from <em>Hokuto no Ken</em></strong></a> (<em><strong>Fist of the North Star</strong></em>)</p>



<p>Ahead of the Season 2 announcement, we had the chance to speak with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves</em> Producer Shinya Tamaki and Director Hayato Konya to discuss the new character additions, the balance changes coming with a big balance patch launching on January 22 and what's in store for the future.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Interview conducted via email.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 brings back heavyweights like Blue Mary, Kim Jae Hoon, and the legendary Wolfgang Krauser. The latter, in particular, hasn’t been a playable character of the "main" timeline for quite some time. How does his return fit into the game with the presence of Rock Howard and the legacy of Geese?</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">(Hayato</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Konya):</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I can't say much now without giving away major spoilers, but this character will be one of the key figures delving into “a certain issue” surrounding Rock and Geese. Please look forward to his release for further details.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Wolfgang Krauser is fondly remembered by long-time SNK fans for his iconic Dies Irae music track. Can fans expect a new arrangement of this classic to debut alongside him, or is the sound team exploring a completely new musical direction for his arrival in South Town?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>This is also something we cannot talk much about at this time, so please look forward to his release.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-nightmare-of-south-town"><strong>The Nightmare of South Town</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Including Nightmare Geese as a new character is definitely an interesting choice. Since Rock has spent his life trying to escape his father’s shadow, does Nightmare Geese appear as a literal haunting/vision for Rock Howard, or is he a simple gameplay addition to bring back an iconic character in some way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>Since Geese himself has died, he cannot be involved in the main storyline. Therefore, this time he appears in the game solely as the “Nightmare of South Town.” Even after death, we believe he would still be a “nightmare” for those living in South Town.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With Jae Hoon joining the roster, the Kim family legacy is now front and centre. How does his playstyle in CotW evolve from his Garou: Mark of the Wolves days, and can we expect any "family reunions" in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>We wanted Jae Hoon to have a different evolution than his brother. We figured he would carry and refine his father's techniques more accurately, so he will have a distinct playstyle to his MotW version. We hope you look forward to it. If both sons continue to do well, we may even see their father again someday.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-monthly-cadence-and-guest-characters">The Monthly Cadence and Guest Characters</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Season 2 will also see the debut of two other mystery characters. Without giving too much away, can you say if the two unannounced challengers in Season 2 follow the trend of "legendary fighters" from SNK's history, or should fans expect more guest characters like Ken and Chun-Li in Season 1?</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">(Shinya</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Tamaki):</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">We'd like to keep this information a secret for now. We are sure fans will be delighted to see who they are, so please look forward to it.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Speaking about guest characters, what is it that would make a character a good fit for FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves? Ken and Chun-Li were designed to feel like their SF6 versions but adapted to the REV system, but for the future, would you be looking for guests that contrast the South Town style, or guests that feel like they’ve always lived there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>As you said, we think that characters that match the world and themes of Fatal Fury make for the best fit. However, we also want to challenge ourselves in terms of game design and make this a game where you can enjoy various kinds of fighting styles and characters with unique traits. Any character that adds to the world of Fatal Fury by their inclusion, as well as a character that fans would enjoy being added, these are the two things we want to prioritize.</em></p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: Releasing a character every month is a very aggressive pace for a modern 2D fighter. What led to the decision to move to this monthly cadence for Season 2, and how does your development pipeline support a quick turnaround without sacrificing quality? Is a new character every month something that should be expected in future seasons as well?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Since this is our first Fatal Fury release in 26 years, we heard from a great number of fans that they wanted to use "this character" or "that character." As developers, we wanted to respond to the players' requests as quickly as possible, so we immediately worked to expand our development scope and capacity. As a result, we finally have the resources to be able to add one character per month starting from October 2025. We will work hard to maintain this cadence for as long as possible going forward, aiming to deliver character additions and updates to the players at a rapid pace.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-upcoming-balance-changes">Upcoming Balance Changes</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With the game changing every 30 days as a new fighter joins the roster, how do you expect the competitive landscape to keep up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>While new characters will be joining the fray, the core gameplay remains unchanged. We hope that players will leverage the skills they've honed thus far to compete and enjoy fighting with these new characters as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 will be accompanied by a major system-wide balance patch. What are some of the most notable changes? And what's the philosophy behind all the upcoming balance changes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>In Season 1, so-called "Standard" characters stood out a bit too prominently, and we felt like characters with other concepts did not get much opportunity to shine. Starting from Season 2, we want to make adjustments that allow those kinds of characters to thrive as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: It has been mentioned that the update will feature system adjustments based on player feedback. What was the #1 request from the community that you were able to address in this upcoming update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>This update releasing on 1/22 includes changes in response to the many things fans have been asking for. We believe that the long time fans have been waiting has allowed us to thoroughly refine the game, so please look forward to it and enjoy it.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-future-of-the-game">The Future of the Game</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves has successfully brought the series back into the global spotlight. As we look past Season 2, what is your long-term vision for the game? Do you see City of the Wolves as a platform that will continue to grow for years to come?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Thank you for your kind words. As developers, we are extremely happy that we were able to bring an IP as cherished by both us and the fans as Fatal Fury back after 26 years. We are deeply grateful to the fans for the positive messages and feedback as well. This has only made us more determined to continue showing off the appeal of the wonderful world of Fatal Fury to even more players. We will continue to work hard as developers to meet fan expectations, so please look forward to the continued growth of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves.</em></p>
