			<p>One of the most significant flaws of Monster Hunter Wilds when it launched earlier this year was the low challenge level offered by the launch content. The general consensus on this issue wasn't fueled by the opinion of veteran players only. Myself, a hunter far from being a series veteran, found the game way too easy, and with the launch endgame not offering anything significantly challenging, I left the game behind, returning to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak</a> for my Monster Hunter fix. However, the game's producer claims that this issue has been resolved, urging lapsed players to return to the game.</p>



<p>Speaking at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, producer Yuya Tokuda talked about the challenges of balancing the game for both newcomers and veterans. </p>



<p><em>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,"</em> said Tokuda-san.</p>



<p>Following its release in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-late-june/">Monster Hunter Wilds received multiple updates</a>, which introduced <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">additional content and a revamped endgame offering more challenges to clear</a>. While the game's update cycle has yet to be completed and there's more to come before the obligatory big expansion, Tokuda-san believes the low difficulty launch issues have been addressed. </p>



<p><em>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again,"</em> the producer said.</p>



<p>As they say, first impressions last a lifetime, so it is understandable that many completed Monster Hunter Wilds and never returned to it due to the low challenge level and, more importantly, performance issues, which have yet to be fixed to this day.</p>



<p> Hopefully, the development team will be able to improve the game further and deliver a better experience in the future, as the new open-world progression, which modernized the experience considerably, is well worth experiencing.

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Was The Biggest New Third-Party Xbox Game Pass Launch in 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you were looking at the calendar, the week that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass, considering the fact that this was Sandfall Interactive's debut title, and (though you may not have known it at the time) it would be competing with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, you'd be forgiven for thinking Clair Obscur didn't have a strong shot at standing out that week.</p>



<p>Not only was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Oblivion Remastered's shadow-dropping in no way a hindrance</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">but according to Xbox Wire,</a> it became, and would remain, the biggest new third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p>



<p>You might have some conspiratorial thinking around that news, thinking that Xbox started tracking this metric to jump on the Clair Obscur hype even more as we inch closer to The Game Awards and the feeling that gaming's modern zeitgeist has already dubbed Clair Obscur to be the game of 2025 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after its sweep at the Golden Joysticks</a>), but this is actually something that <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/31/palworld-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever/">Xbox began tracking only last year</a>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">Palworld became the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass ever</a>.</p>



<p>And, in fairness, considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCy6vC00O0c&amp;t=1s">Clair Obscur's appearance in January's Developer_Direct video</a> is at least partial proof that Xbox has been behind the Clair Obscur hype for a long time now.</p>



<p>The size of the launch is measured by the number of unique users who played the game within its first 30 days of availability, which means that in its first month of release, when the whole industry seemed consumed by the Clair Osbcur craze, a lot of players rushed to Xbox Game Pass to see what all the fuss was about.</p>



<p>"<em>This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it’s down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality</em>," said Sandfall Interactive creative director, Guillaume Broche, in an Xbox Wire post. "<em>It’s really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream</em>."</p>



<p>Broche also noted that Sandfall Interactive's working with Xbox and releasing on Game Pass was a key element to getting the word out about Clair Obscur. "<em>From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Letting a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before. The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year</a>, he gave it a 9.5/10 and pegged it as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Fast forward to today and not only did it sweep The Golden Joysticks, winning seven awards (including Ultimate Game of the Year), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">but it has 12 nominations at The Game Awards</a>, and could very well repeat its Golden Joysticks performance. </p>
