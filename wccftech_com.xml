			<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former head of the Assassin's Creed series at Ubisoft has clarified a key detail of his sudden departure from Ubisoft. Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">through an IGN report (which Wccftech independently verified),</a> that Marc-Alexis Côté had left Ubisoft after 20 years with the company, 16 of them working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and his final three as head of the entire franchise.</p>



<p>Côté's departure was framed as a result of the restructuring caused by Ubisoft's new subsidiary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>, a branch opened to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry brands that Ubisoft established in collaboration with Tencent. A Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed to Wccftech by email that Côté "<em>was offered various leadership roles [within Vantage Studios] but respectfully declined</em>," and refused to speak further about the roles in question.</p>



<p>According to Côté, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">in a post on his personal LinkedIn account</a>, that's not how things shook out.</p>



<p>"<em>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice,</em>" Côté writes.</p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</em></p>



<p>So, while Ubisoft's version of events can still be technically true in that there was a potential role for Côté within Vantage Studios that he said no to, we now know that Ubisoft did not really give Côté a choice in the matter, and it almost seems like their preference was to lose a stalwart of the series, someone who had been through key periods of the franchise in lead creative roles, and who knew the franchise so intimately he could be at the helm of everything to do with Assassin's Creed, than to keep him.</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated that Côté's loss is a big one for Ubisoft, since veterans like him can be essential to keeping a long-running franchise alive and well, not just for their own leadership capabilities but also for their ability to mentor the next generation. Pushing out one of the people most knowledgeable about Assassin's Creed at Ubisoft is not necessarily a great start for Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>In any case, it'll be interesting to see how the Vantage Studios co-leads, Charlie Guillemot, the son of Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, carry the series forward.</p>

			<p>A long time ago, developers Double Fine burst onto the scene with the flop that was Psychonauts, following this up with the equally floppy Brütal Legend. Of course, Psychonauts became a cult classic, and I enjoyed Jack Black's Musical Strategy more than most. However, these efforts resulted in Double Fine spending a few years creating smaller titles before the massive Kickstarter success of Broken Age, followed by Psychonauts 2's success on the Fig crowdfunding network, and the acquisition by Microsoft. This brings us to Keeper, their first game in four years.</p>



<p>So with that long introduction out of the way, let's talk about Keeper. You can tell this is a Double Fine game, with its unique art style, a story that is somewhat "out there", and just something that is generally difficult to pin down for one reason or another.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Let's start with what is easy to pin down: this is an adventure/walking simulator. There are puzzles, but I'm going to say it's not really a puzzle game because everything can be solved by just moving your character's head the right way, and then moving forward. There's no real thinking required. Sure, there are some where you have to shine your light on something, to free something else, and then take that something somewhere, but it's not going to test you.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not meant to test you. Keeper is about the journey and the story, more than anything else. The premise of the game is that you are a lighthouse that has gained sentience after a bird crashes into you. How you gained sentience, who knows? How you retain that sentience after (spoilers) being demolished, and being turned into a ship, a Beyblade, and then a crab-ship, I still have no idea.</p>



<p>What I do know is that the theme of the game, being about light fighting off darkness, is a little obvious, even if Double Fine has made it clear that the player is to take away from it what they will. The open cinematic is so reminiscent of Gandalf shining light to push off the Nazgul to save Faramir; it can't be a coincidence. If there is meant to be some deeper meaning, it was utterly lost on me.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, because there are positives to take away from Keeper. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, with an art style I can't take my eyes off of. The scenery and settings, particularly some of the stranger ones when magic comes into play, are like walking through beautiful paintings. There are some little secrets to find, so slight exploration is rewarded to an extent, but the problem is that Keeper is at its best about halfway through.</p>


<figure>

<p>I'll explain, but then it's going to be a bit more negative. Keeper has a part which opens up a little; it's still linear, but that's not a problem. What is important is that you surround yourself with candyfloss, and this allows you to jump into some straightforward platforming. There's no difficulty here, but it <em>feels</em> fantastic. As you move through the game, the feel of your character adjusts based on the form you're in, but it never feels better than this platforming candyfloss form.</p>



<p>This ends up being the core problem of Keeper, at least for me. I could be completely wrong, but the game feels like a wide range of levels and designs were created, and the game was extended to accommodate them. You reach close to the top in the Lighthouse form, then you crash down. Then, in a boat form, you go so far before being demolished. Then you're quickly in a Beyblade form, facing what could be considered the only 'boss', before being knocked out. Finally, you're the crab for all of twenty minutes.</p>



<p>The problem is that it doesn't feel organic in its progression, and, at least for me, there are only so many times I can do the same thing without it feeling like padding for the sake of padding. The second I'm playing a game and I'm thinking "I'm bored now", there's something that has gone wrong, which is a shame because that boredom goes away and Keeper finds its stride again a little later.</p>

<p>Keeper is a strange game, to say the least, and one that isn't easy to review. As gorgeous as it is, and as fantastic as the animations and characterisations of the Keeper and its friendly bird are, it is still one that ultimately outstayed its welcome while I was playing it. The thirty-nine stages could have been condensed, and the game, taking up to eight hours, would have been more effective and impactful if it had been an hour or two shorter.</p>



<p>Would I recommend giving it a go? For the art style alone, I probably would, yes. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, and there were moments that I genuinely had a smile on my face. It was a shame that there were other moments when I literally sighed and said, "I've had enough now," although this may not be the same for everybody.</p>

			<p>NetEase has announced that the popular free-to-play team-based 6v6 third-person online action game Marvel Rivals is getting its first PvE mode on October 23. It will be inspired by Marvel Zombies, the four-episode adult animated television miniseries released on September 24 via Disney+.</p>



<p>The announcement came with a brief video where Marvel Games Executive Producer Danny Koo explained:</p>



<p><em>In this Marvel Zombies inspired mode, you get to play as Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher, taking on endless waves of zombies. You'll have to survive the Horde, go toe-to-toe with zombie Namor and the Queen of the Dead as bosses and fight to save the world from getting totally zombified. We have also given each hero some unique abilities. Charge through the hordes as Jeff, slice and dice with Blade's bouncing Moon Blades, shock zombies with Thor in his persistent Awakened state. Or go berserk as Magik in her unlimited Darkchild form. Showcase your epic combat skills against the zombie swarms and tough bosses.</em></p>

<p>More details are yet to come, such as when this limited-time event will end.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-launches-next-week-daredevil-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently up to its Season 4.5 'Heart of the Dragon'</a>, which launched last week and delivered the long-requested cross-platform progression feature. Moreover, it introduced Daredevil as the 43rd playable character. In the game, Daredevil is a combo-oriented Duelist (the archetype for high-damage characters) with plenty of mobility. The character also has a team-up ability with The Punisher.</p>

			<p>Thanks to Sony and PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">lawsuit against Tencent over Horizon knock-off, Light of Motiram</a>, we have an update for the previously confirmed Horizon Zero Dawn movie that's in the works. First reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">The Game Post</a>, the movie is set to start filming sometime in 2026, and is intended to be out in theatres the following year, in 2027.</p>



<p>The confirmation came as part of the sworn declaration from Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, the branch Sony opened specifically for its film and TV collaborations and adaptations. According to Qizilbash, there's already a script in place, and PlayStation Productions is currently looking for a director.</p>



<p>"<em>We are in development for a film based on Horizon in partnership with Columbia Pictures</em>. <em>We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film Uncharted and the 2023 film Gran Turismo</em>," Qizilbash writes in his declaration, per The Game Post.</p>



<p>Initially, PlayStation's adaptation of Horizon was intended to be a TV series produced in collaboration with Netflix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/">though those plans were scrapped this past April</a> in favour of making a movie instead. Since the film still doesn't have a director attached to it, we're still a ways out from hearing about any casting decisions or ideas around what the film will cover.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see who PlayStation Productions is able to find to direct, and then where the search for who will play Aloy ends up.</p>
