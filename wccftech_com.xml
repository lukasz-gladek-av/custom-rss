			<p>IO Interactive and Feral Interactive have <a href="https://feralinteractive.com/en/news/?platform=ios&amp;game=hitmanabsolution">announced</a> that Hitman: Absolution will be making its way to handheld devices, with a mobile version of the 2012 game coming to iOS and Android later this fall, followed by a Nintendo Switch version before the end of 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is also in the works, though that won't arrive until 2026.</p>



<p>Feral Interactive is the same porting house that brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-switch-better-ps4/">Alien: Isolation to the Nintendo Switch</a> with extremely impressive visuals, and the team who brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-blood-money-reprisal-is-sneaking-its-way-to-mobile-platforms-this-fall/">Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal</a> to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2023. This new version of Hitman: Absolution is the studio directly building off its mobile port of Blood Money.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer that debuted alongside the announcement shows how Feral Interactive is bringing the experience of Absolution onto your mobile devices, with full touchscreen controls, though the studio also clarifies that these versions will also support you plugging in a controller or keyboard and mouse, if you have the time and space for it. </p>

No specific release date for the mobile versions or the Nintendo Switch versions has been confirmed.</p>

			<p>During the Nintendo Partner Showcase, Bloober Team confirmed that Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on September 5 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The September 5 date circulated earlier today after TrueAchievements <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> something about it in their datamining. Since September 5 isn't fall yet, it seems likely the Polish developer was very loosely referring to Fall when it first <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> its release window during Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>



<p>Anyway, the upside is that the game is only a few weeks away from launching. By <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to this page</a>, you can read Kai's hands-on from a recent press event. Here's an excerpt:</p>



<p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</em></p>



<p>During that occasion, Kai also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-qa-we-want-to-cook-this-one-a-bit-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Lead Level Designer Piotr Tylus. Among other things, he inquired about the similarities and differences with the Silent Hill 2 remake:</p>



<p><em>We are sharing our experiences for sure. We provide each other with feedback, so we try to learn our lessons. During development, as you can imagine, there's a lot of iteration going around. You play test and iterate and so on and so on. But we also wanted to make our own thing. I like the analogy from the presentation, that pizzas have different toppings and there is no superior pizza. We want to cook a little bit differently, just to separate ourselves from the other projects we're doing.</em></p>

			<p>Nintendo kicked off its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> today with an announcement from Capcom, and the reveal that Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. It'll also arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Four years after the launch of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-already-shipped-1-million-units/">sold over 1 million units in its first 10 days</a>, and was eventually able to <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">surpass 2 million units sold</a>, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection continues the story-focused Monster Hunter series with twin Rathalos being born. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Twin Rathalos born in a twist of fate. Their appearance sets the stage for a new tale of Riders and Rathalos to unfold,"</em> reads the video's description. "<em>Become a Rider, bond with monsters, and explore the vibrant world of Monster Hunter in this next evolution of the Monster Hunter Stories series."</em></p>



<p>A press release for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection goes further to explain that the game centers on "<em>two nations on the path of ruin</em>," and that the emergence of two Rathalos brings a sense of despair instead of hope, as both monsters have the strength to cause even more destruction while two nations are at war.</p>



<p>Players will play as the heir to Azuria, who is the sole Rathalos rider and sets out on a journey to uncover a phenomena that threatens the whole world. </p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/">Devil May Cry 5 </a>has been Capcom's strongest-selling game for its first quarter of FY2026, you'd be mistaken to put out Monster Hunter Wilds, which had an incredibly strong launch and in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuoxk57s2j">US alone</a> has been the best-selling game of 2025 so far. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter has been one of Capcom's strongest series in its portfolio, so it's not surprising that the company wanted to have another Monster Hunter game lined up for next year after Wilds kicked off 2025. Hopefully, we'll have more information on a specific release date soon.</p>
