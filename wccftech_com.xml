			<p>Battlefield 6 may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched ray tracing effects in an effort to deliver optimal performance</a> (which the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely achieved</a>, as the game runs as smoothly as butter). However, the game, powered by the latest version of the Frostbite engine, is still quite the visual treat.</p>



<p>YouTuber ElAnalistaDeBits has decided to compare the game's maps to their real-life counterparts. In the video embedded below, we can see how the Gibraltar and New York City maps (Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Manhattan Bridge) stand up to the real locations. Overall, the developers have done an admirable job, to be sure, though of course, there are a few creative liberties here and there. After all, the purpose was not to make the Battlefield 6 maps 1:1 replicas; instead, they sought to replicate the location's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mere hours after the Battlefield 6 launch, the new installment in the popular military first-person shooter series <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">has already thrashed any previous Steam concurrency records in the franchise</a> with 747K concurrent players. To be fair, though, successful entries such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 only landed on Steam in June 2020, many years after their actual debuts. That's because Electronic Arts tried to use the games to push its own launcher, Origin, making them exclusive to the platform. The company <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only decided to switch strategy in late 2019</a>, returning its games to Valve's platform. Battlefield 2042 launched on November 19, 2021 on both Origin and Steam, but that game had its own issues and only reached a peak of 107K concurrent players.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying Battlefield 6, perhaps <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review written by David Carcasole</a> can help you decide:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play. The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em></p>
