			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has put out its report for which PC and console games in September 2025 led the industry in terms of revenue and monthly active users. Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 26 sat at the top of the charts in terms of revenue, though curiously it didn't even crack the top 10 for monthly active users. Elsewhere, Hollow Knight Silksong beat out one of September's major triple-A releases to crack the top 5 on the revenue charts.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reportedly-hits-10-million-copies-sold/">EA Sports FC 26 at the top of the revenue charts</a>, coming in second was NBA 2K26, followed by Borderlands 4 in third. Fourth place went to Fortnite, which was three spots down from where it was in August 2025, but fifth in the charts was Hollow Knight Silksong, which shows just how impactful and successful a launch the game has had after years of players waiting for it.</p>



<p>Behind Silksong was Counter-Strike 2, and then in seventh place, September's other major triple-A release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. Helldivers 2, EA Sports Madden NFL 26, and Valorant round out the rest of the top 10 in terms of revenue in eighth, ninth, and tenth place, respectively.</p>

<p>Despite EA Sports FC 26 leading the charts in terms of revenue, it was not one of the two EA games that made the monthly active users charts. Those spots were hit by Skate, which made the list in sixth place, and last year's FC game, EA Sports FC 25. It's odd to see EA Sports FC 25 this high on the charts in the same month that EA Sports FC 26 came out, but that's likely due to the fact that FC 26 only had four days in September to rack up user numbers, since it came out on September 26.</p>



<p>The rest of the monthly active users charts largely remained the same, with Skate being the only new game to make the list, and the other nine shuffling around in the top 10. Fortnite and Call of Duty stayed in their same spots at number one and number two, while Helldivers 2 found its way back into the list by hitting the number nine spot, thanks in part to its arrival on Xbox in August.</p>



<p>Outside of the top 10, No Man's Sky jumped 34 spots in terms of monthly active users to 18th, thanks to its new Voyagers update, and in regard to revenue, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> made the top 20 at number 20, thanks to its 1.0 launch last month. </p>

			<p>Ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana releasing on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming November 13, 2025, Ubisoft has released a new gameplay deep dive trailer, going over what the game's campaign will focus on, and what's coming in the game's Year 1 Content Pass.</p>



<p>In Anno 117: Pax Romana's campaign, players will step into the role of Marcus or Marcia, and after being appointed a Roman governor, you'll try to shape the Celtic region you are charged with leading, and decide whether to enforce Roman traditions, or find ways to blend Roman and Celtic culture. Your campaign will also be slightly changed depending on who you choose to play as. Choosing Marcus will set one specific path in motion, and choosing Marcia, another.</p>

<p>After release, the Year 1 content pass for Pax Romana will include three DLC releases. Provinces of Ash, the first DLC release, will introduce Latium, a large island with new cultural encounters, and a towering volcano that could prove to be a problem. The second DLC release is The Hippodrome, which adds a large stadium arena for players to construct and hold chariot races and big entertaining events for citizens.</p>



<p>The third is called Dawn of the Delta, which adds a new river-based province and a new culture as you expand to the Egyptian frontier.</p>



<p>Ubisoft did not yet say as to what the pace of these DLC releases will be, but since they're supposed to last for the first year of Pax Romana, it's probably a safe bet that they'll be fairly spaced out.</p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, the company's lead on <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">its Assassin's Creed franchise left</a> following the restructuring involving the new subsidiary Ubisoft opened with Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>.</p>
