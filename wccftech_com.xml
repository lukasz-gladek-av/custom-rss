			<p>Veteran game designer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58. The sad and unexpected news comes directly from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his own Facebook page</a>, where he had asked a friend to post a message in the event of his passing, which he must have seen coming.</p>



<p><em>The flame of my life is finally about to be extinguished.</em></p>



<p><em>The fact that this message has been posted means that time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have asked someone important to post this final message.)</em></p>



<p><em>My life was a continuous battle. I kept winning.<br>I also caused a lot of trouble.</em></p>



<p><em>I take pride in having fought to the end, following my convictions.<br>I have no regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>But I am filled with regret that I could not deliver new work to all my fans. I'm sorry.</em></p>



<p><em>That's how it is.<br>So it goes.</em></p>



<p><span>This is a hard-hitting message, to be sure, and one that is undoubtedly in line with Tomonobu Itagaki's unique personality, just like when he&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/itagaki-ps4-pro-just-rhetoric-vr/" target="_blank">criticized Sony for making the PlayStation 4 Pro console</a>. The game designer was mainly</span> known as the creator of the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and also as the man responsible for the successful reboot of the Ninja Gaiden series. Itagaki left KOEI TECMO after sixteen years and filed a lawsuit against the company due to them withholding pay.</p>



<p>He then quickly launched a new game developer called Valhalla Game Studios alongside other former Team Ninja members. This studio released Devil's Third, an action/adventure game for the Nintendo Wii U. However, the game wasn't well received both critically and commercially. In November 2021, Tencent acquired Valhalla's parent company, Wake Up Interactive, for $44 million. The following month, Wake Up merged Valhalla Game Studios' staff and operations into another subsidiary, Soleil Ltd., effectively closing down Valhalla.</p>



<p>Tomonobu Itagaki once again did not despair and founded another company called Itagaki Games. The final news tidbit about the company was shared by Itagaki around a year ago, when he revealed that the company name had been slightly changed to Itagaki Games, Inc. Unfortunately, the studio never released a game before Itagaki's passing.</p>



<p>The news comes just days before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo-game-show-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth installment in the Ninja Gaiden franchise</a>, many years after the previous iteration. </p>



<p>Wccftech would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the friends and family of this important figure in the games industry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Gets Reduced Ticket Count in Conquest Mode and Players Aren’t Very Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-in-conquest-mode-and-players-aren%E2%80%99t-very-happy.1326259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is certainly off to a strong start. Sales estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that it has already sold more than six and a half million units across all platforms</a>, and the game launched to a positive vibe in the community.</p>



<p>That said, fans already disagree with the development team on a few things. For example, yesterday the developers <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a backend update</a> that reduced the beginning ticket count when playing Conquest on all maps:</p>



<p><em>We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Empire State from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</em></li>



<li><em>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The community isn't really convinced this was needed, though. Most comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o7cerx/backend_update_battlefield_studios_has_reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a> state that they never had that occurrence (rounds hitting the time limit instead of one team running out of tickets) happen to them. Some even go as far as accusing the developers of pursuing the Call of Duty crowd in Battlefield 6 with changes like this. That goes hand in hand with criticism leveled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the upcoming Season 1</a>, which will include new 4v4 and 8v8 modes. Veteran Battlefield players would rather get more large maps for classic franchise modes like Conquest, as they believe that the launch maps are on the smaller side.</p>



<p>For its part, Battlefield Studios has introduced a small change born out of user feedback: in the Manhattan Bridge map, when playing Conquest and Escalation modes, the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles has been doubled from five to ten seconds. Lastly, the developers actually just pushed a very small (27 MB on Steam) patch, updating the game to version 1.0.1.6. This update merely improves backend stability in anticipation of the Season 1 launch, scheduled for Tuesday, October 28.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-november-7-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-on-november-7-with-path-tracing-and-an-ai-metaverse-of-intelligent-npcs.1326232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ZhuRong Studio, an internal development team of NetEase, announced that the global launch of the open world MMO Sword of Justice has been set for November 7 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2782500/SWORD_OF_JUSTICE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.nshmna&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sword-of-justice/id6743792551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>.</p>



<p>This is a free-to-play game, although the developers have promised that there is no pay-to-win at all and character progression is gameplay-driven, with strict stat limits and regular seasonal resets, creating an even playing field, where players are rewarded for their skill.</p>



<p>The MMO's narrative is adapted from Wen Ruian's classic literary masterpiece, The Four Great Constables: Sword of Justice. The story is set during the Song Dynasty (between 960 and 1279), and players can explore a vast open world, conquer peaks and caverns, seek out lost weapons and martial techniques, solve ancient puzzles, and, most of all, master martial arts to battle mythical beasts and outlaws in the wilderness and in dungeons to gather rare treasures.</p>



<p>The Windstride and Shadowbearer skills facilitate traversal of the world, as players can parkour, sprint on walls, glide, and more. Furthermore, unlike most MMOs, there are many paths to character development, including life skills such as cooking, fishing, case solving, performing, farming, archeology, presiding over court trials, and many more. Combat roles also reportedly break away from genre conventions, allowing tanks to heal and healers to deal significant damage. Players will thus be able to create their own unique fighting styles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Sword of Justice also features an 'AI Metaverse' of intelligent NPCs with unique personalities, fluid routines, and personal memories, allowing them to interact with the player realistically. Lastly, the game was also enhanced with the latest visual technologies: ray tracing is supported on mobile devices, while the PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports full path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction and DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> to get the best performance and graphics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, the base requirements to play Sword of Justice on PC are actually very low:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX750TI or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>



<p><strong>Recommended<br>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit or newer<br><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i7 9th generation or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 or better (or AMD equivalent)<br><strong>DirectX: </strong>Version 11<br><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 55 GB available space<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommended</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials Is Getting an Invasion PvP Mode in Time for Halloween]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-getting-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outlast-trials-is-getting-an-invasion-pvp-mode-in-time-for-halloween.1326226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Montréal-based developer Red Barrels announced that the co-op horror game The Outlast Trials will be getting an Invasion PvP mode next week, on October 21, in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>Players can access the new Invasion Mode via the Sleep Room Terminals and join as either a Reagent or an Imposter. Only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial. While waiting, the others can serve as the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. As their peers succeed in their sabotage… or die trying, each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial.</p>



<p>These are the key features of the new PvP Invasion Mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Become the hunter:</strong> stalk your prey from the shadows. Use stealth and subterfuge to sneak up on unsuspecting reagents before going in for the kill.</li>



<li><strong>Surveil the trials:</strong> Plan your route and attack strategy by carefully considering surveillance camera footage. Your fellow Imposters</li>



<li><strong>Don a Deadly Disguise:</strong> Dress in the garb and skin of your targets to gain their trust. Then, when the moment’s right…</li>



<li><strong>Stab them in the back:</strong> Close-quarters combat is the only rule of engagement. Outwit your opponents with multiple blade strikes or a single lethal stab. One slip-up means certain death, ratcheting up the intensity in the high-pressure trial arenas.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The update that goes live next week in The Outlast Trials will also add the Geister 2025 New Time-Limited Event and Time-Limited Catalog, two new MK-Challenges (Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur), and the debut of the new In-Game Store.</p>



<p>As a reminder, The Outlast Trials <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-launches-on-march-5-2024-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on March 5, 2024</a> for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X after less than a year of early access on PC. The game has had a positive reception from fans, with between two and three million units estimated to have been sold via Steam alone.</p>
