			<p>A new trailer today has been published, showcasing the world of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The game will be arriving on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2025. For those who are fans of the Xenoblade Universe, this is a massive opportunity and upgrade for the title, as it was previously released in 2015 on the Wii U. Now, the sci-fi RPG will be coming to the Nintendo Switch with new story elements to dive into, new characters to love (or hate), new Skell and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-comparison/">enhanced visuals</a>. Below is the brand-new trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition.</p>

<p>This game takes place in the year 2054, when the Earth has been destroyed by a war between two alien races, and it means that humanity is close to becoming extinct. A number of survivors crash land on the planet Mira, and it becomes your job to restore humanity and give them a fighting chance again.</p>
<p>As you explore Mira and get to see all of the different environments, you'll also get your own Skell, which is a powerful exoskeleton that can fly, transform into a vehicle, and give you great strength in battle.</p>
