			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch is now available on PC, introducing Photo Mode improvements as well as gameplay, cutscenes, and AMD FSR fixes and changes.</p>



<p>The 1.3.0 patch, which has gone live today, focuses on further polishing the PC version of the game released in June, and thus doesn't introduce any significant new features. Among the changes introduced by the patch is a Photo Mode improvement which displays a logo control indicator when selecting a logo, fixes for a variety of issues, including an issue that prevented players from exiting the shop after purchasing the Polarized Sunglasses from Clyde's shop, an issues where Eve's hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytibe cutscene when wearing the Fluffy Bear or Pink Bear outfits, Korean voice acting issues in a specific conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert and more. The new patch also changes AMD FSR so that players now need to restart the game to enable frame generation, and improves the save timestamp system so that the time since the last save is accurately displayed based on successful saves and not attempted saves. You can head over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535482242423588652?l=english">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade made its debut on PC one year after its launch on PlayStation 5 and it was, by all accounts, a rather successful launch, thanks to a solid port that runs well on many different system configurations. Though the port didn't need any major fixes, Shift Up supported the PC version wellafter launch with a few patches, including patch <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-1-20-patch-hard-mode-improves-vram/">1.2.0</a>, which introduced plenty of improvements and unlocked Hard Mode without completing the game first.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the solid action RPG developed by Shift Up by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
