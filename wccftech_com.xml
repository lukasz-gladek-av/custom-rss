			<p>Black Mesa, the well-known remake of the first entry in the Half-Life series developed by Crowbar Collective, looks great with modded path tracing, but it also proves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">once again</a>, how gaming hardware is still not at a point where it can run even older games with full path tracing at high resolutions without upscalers and frame generation.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the game's Remixed mod running with RTX Remix path tracing, highlighting how path tracing, alongside the other improvements featured in the mod, significantly improves visuals, but also completely tanks performance even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080. In the side-by-side shots at the beginning of the video, it's highlighted via a performance overlay how the game can go from running in the 200-plus FPS range without path tracing to the high 30s, low-to-mid 40s range with path tracing with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. As such, Frame Generation becomes a necessity to run the game at higher, more playable framerates with path tracing.</p>

<p>The Black Mesa Remixed mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-remixed-poc-inbound">ModDB</a>, introduces plenty of improvements to the remake of the first Half-Life game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">released in 2020</a>. It relights the inbound train ride and parts of the laboratory, and introduces five new meshes including 2K and 4K textures, 10 new meshes that were only present as texture in the original game, 40 to 50 very high quality materials built from the ground up and around 100 materials created from the original colormap using a mixture of techniques and workflows. As such, the mod is worth trying out even without path tracing to experience a small portion of the Half-Life remake like never before.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-realityv-ray-tracing-improvements/">Grand Theft Auto V</a> was initially released on September 17, 2013, and will have officially been out for 12 years this coming September. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, it's been a game they played countless times, or at least have had access to through legal means for the last dozen years. Unless you've spent the last 12 years of your life living in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and didn't try to obtain the game through any under-the-counter means, in which case, Grand Theft Auto V is a brand new release for you in 2025. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are now available in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and as <a href="https://nikopartners.com/grand-theft-approval-a-turning-point-for-mena-game-regulations/">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad reports</a>, both titles being approved for launch in the regions is a "<em>turning point for MENA game regulations</em>."</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V getting approval for launch in Saudi Arabia and the UAE also marks the introduction of a new age rating in the region, with the General Authority for Media Regulation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE Media Council introducing a 21+ rating. Grand Theft Auto isn't the only series that hasn't had major releases in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. </p>



<p>The regulatory boards in both regions have previously blocked games based on restrictions that for ratings boards like the ESRB or PEGI would fall under M for Mature/PEGI 18+. The introduction of this new age rating, as Ahmad points out, is what potentially opens the door for those titles that would've previously not made it through. Particularly because under this new rating, Grand Theft Auto V is being allowed to launch "<em>without any major modification</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This is a positive signal for the industry as it potentially allows games to be approved without edits, thereby offering publishers a viable path to market for games that would normally be blocked</em>," Ahmad writes.</p>



<p>So while GTA V and GTA Online getting approval isn't the most significant thing on its own, especially because GTA V has still circulated in the region through unofficial means in the last decade, this new age rating is the thing that has the power to have a drastic impact on the video game industry in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and the rest of the globe. </p>

			<p>Sucker Punch Productions is one of the longest-standing PlayStation Studios teams, with a storied history and more than a few series and characters who've taken the PlayStation spotlight over the years. During the PlayStation 3 era, that series was Infamous, a series of games that spilled over into the PlayStation 4 era, but has been dormant since the release of a main game and a shorter DLC title that both arrived at the beginning of the PS4 generation. </p>



<p>Infamous was followed up with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"> Ghost of Tsushima,</a> a decision that very few, if any, would question, considering how successful Ghost of Tsushima has been, both as a commercial product and as a game that is beloved by players and critics alike. But that hasn't stopped players who loved Infamous from wondering out loud if Sucker Punch would return to the series. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">GameInformer</a>, where creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell were talking all things Ghost of Yotei ahead of the game's October release, Fox was asked if he'd be open to going back to the Infamous games. </p>



<p>"<em>I would love to work on more Infamous</em>," Fox began. "<em>I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yotei.</em>"</p>



<p>For as long as Sucker Punch has been making games for PlayStation consoles, the studio has focused on one series at a time. On the PlayStation 2, that series was Sly Cooper. It made three Sly Cooper games for PS2 before the series spilled over into the PS3 generation with another developer at the helm. Then it was Infamous with two games made for PS3, one for PS4, and one shorter, expansion-sized game, also for PS4.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was undoubtedly the studio's main game for the PS4 generation. The 'Ghost' series is only the second time in the studio's history that it has worked on games in a series that has straddled two console generations, but what Sucker Punch has never done so far is look back. As a fan of Infamous myself, I would love to see them return to the series, rerelease the trilogy and make a proper fourth installment, but I can't say that feels likely. </p>



<p>Who knows, though. Perhaps Fox, I, and many players around the world who still have a love for the Infamous games will get our wish.</p>
