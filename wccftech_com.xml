			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> is already executing on the first part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-january-april-2026-embark-studios/">recently revealed <strong>January to April 2026</strong> roadmap</a> for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>,</strong> with its first new update for the year, titled <strong>Headwinds</strong>, arriving to all players tomorrow, <strong>January 27, 2026,</strong> introducing a new map condition, a new Trophy Display project, and most importantly, a new <strong>Solos vs. Squads</strong> matchmaking queue option.</p>



<p>Following last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-now-live-embark-studios/">Cold Snap update</a>, the Rust Belt has thawed, and the <strong>Buried City</strong> is becoming '<strong>Bird City</strong>,' with plenty of birds flocking to the area and gathering resources in nests on high chimneys, resources that are ripe for the picking if you're able to climb to them. Bird City is the update's new map condition, with Embark warning that you'll want to have a serious look around before going for one of the nests, as you're likely to draw the attention of another Raider, waiting to catch you off guard.</p>



<p>The new matchmaking option, Solos vs. Squads, is a big update for PvP-focused players. If you feel like you could take on a full enemy squad on your own, and you're above <strong>level 40</strong>, then this new matchmaking option will let you really push your limits for a chance at higher XP and loot rewards.</p>

<p>The update also adds a new <strong>Trophy Display</strong> project, where you can build out your trophy case of the different ARC machines you've taken down. Lastly, the update also brings some new cosmetics, introducing the <strong>Sandwalker Set </strong>for users to grab.</p>



<p>Embark's new entry into the extraction shooter genre has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold more than <strong>12 million copies</strong> since it launched last October</a>, and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam in 2025</a>. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">currently nominated for several DICE Awards,</a> including Game of the Year. </p>

			<p>The news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has surpassed the total </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank">number of&nbsp;<strong>Game of the Year</strong>&nbsp;<strong>awards</strong></a>&nbsp;won by the previous record holder, FromSoftware's Elden Ring (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our very own awards marking the historical occurrence</a></strong>), has circulated widely on the Web over</span> the past few days. </p>



<p>Industry veteran <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whom <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we recently interviewed about the state of the MMORPG industry in Western countries</a></strong>, shared his thoughts on the event <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rich-vogel-093425_i-am-very-happy-that-expedition-has-been-activity-7419821314288410624-rTqW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>. Vogel feels that Expedition 33 is a 'really good game', but also <strong>can't quite wrap his head around it being 'better' than Elden Ring</strong>, which he praised for its brilliant open world design.</p>



<p><em>I am very happy that Expedition has been honored with so many awards. It is a really good game. It is hard for me to accept that Expedition 33 is a better game than Elden Ring. I had more fun playing Elden Ring. The open-world design was brilliant. I like that it did not force you down paths like Skyrim and gave you the freedom to go anywhere in the world. You started out being hunted and became the hunter.</em></p>



<p>Another industry veteran who was part of the aforementioned Wccftech interview on MMOs, <strong>Greg Street</strong>, also replied that Elden Ring is much more replayable. Street <strong>called Expedition 33 a masterpiece</strong> but also noted that the game's emotional story makes people more forgiving of other faults, such as the level design.</p>



<p><em>I imagine I will play Expedition 33 once or twice more in my lifetime, which is typical for single player RPGs for me. I predict I will go back to Elden Ring ten times or more. The replayability potential between the two is hard to compare. I think 33 is a masterpiece for sure, but I think people’s love for the story and characters leads them to overly forgive other places where the game is weaker, such as level design.</em></p>



<p>Of course, the fact that Sandfall's acclaimed turn-based JRPG has earned more Game of the Year awards (436 versus 435, though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 still has several prizes left to claim) than Elden Ring <strong>does not mean it is objectively 'better'</strong>. For one thing, FromSoftware's game arguably had stronger competition, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarök</a></strong> taking its own share of GOTY awards that year. </p>
