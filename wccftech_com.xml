			<p>The European gaming market didn't have a great year for sales. GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring revealed this tidbit during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-in-review-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GI Microcast show</a>, confirming that sales of new games went down by 29% compared to last year, as registered by GSD data.</p>
<p>2023 was always going to be a tough comparison. Last year saw the release of games like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Diablo IV, Mortal Kombat 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy XVI, just to name a few. 2024 just didn't have the same sheer triple-A power when it came to its schedule. Dring admitted as much in the podcast while also singling out two games that underperformed: Star Wars Outlaws and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>Sales of new games in 2024 versus new games in 2023, and let's remember 2023 was a big year for new games, were down 29%, almost a third, year-on-year. Next year's the return of big blockbuster new games, even from February when you've got that sort of triple threat of Assassin's Creed Shadows and Avowed (I know Av</em><em>owed isn't that big) and Monster Hunter Wilds all in the same window. And there's all the games that were announced during The Game Awards, there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Elden Ring coming out</a>, and there's a Grand Theft Auto, which obviously is the big thing. </em></p>
<p><em>There's a new Nintendo console, and there's gonna be loads and loads and loads of games next year, but I'm alarmed by this data because, despite the fact that there weren't a lot of major titles, the big Star Wars game of the year only got to number 45 in a year where there wasn't a lot of games coming out. </em><em>In terms of the traditional big blockbuster Christmas games, you had Call of Duty, which did well, and you had Dragon Age, which did not. That is disappointing, though, that position. T</em><em>hat was it. Dragon Age&nbsp;had the market to itself and it couldn't find an audience, and that really is scary as we move into the following year.</em></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ranked #14 and #19, respectively, when it comes to the new games European chart. But switching to the full chart that also includes games released in previous years, they drop to #45 and #68. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> is similar in that it ranked in the ninth place among new games but only #34 overall. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, which was the twelfth best-selling new game of 2024 but only ranked #43 in the global chart.</p>
<p>Only five new games performed at least decently this year in Europe: Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO (#13), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> (#12), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> (#6), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (#3). Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 25 dominated European sales in 2024.</p>
