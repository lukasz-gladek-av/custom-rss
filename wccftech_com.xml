			<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced is a new "<em>upgraded</em>" version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-steam-launch-now-officially-scheduled-for-november-19th/">2019 entry</a> to the series from developer Ys Net that'll arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in the series history, Shenmue is coming to a Nintendo platform, but there's no specification if it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, or both.</p>



<p>Unlike the original release published by Deep Silver, this new version of the game will be published by ININ Games, which acquired the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/">publishing rights to Shenmue 3 last November</a>. Also, if you already own Shenmue 3 on PlayStation 4 or PC, you'll be able to upgrade to this new version, though the details regarding whether it's a paid update or a free one are still to come.</p>



<p>According to a press release, this new version of the game will feature "<em>overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates</em>." A few of those upgrades include new 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR, and faster load times. </p>



<p>There are also a few gameplay-specific improvements, like increased NPC density in Niaowu, a classic camera mode for those who want to play Shenmue 3 as if it was made immediately after the original two titles. Adjustments to Ryo's stamina, health restoration between fights, and a reduction of money barriers have also been added, alongside the ability to skip NPC conversations and cutscenes if you want to get back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>And, for those who perhaps want the visual improvements but don't want any of the gameplay adjustments, all of these additions are optional, and can be toggled from the menu if you'd rather play without them.</p>



<p>No specific release date has been announced for Shenmue 3 Enhanced Edition, though with Gamescom 2025 set to kick off hours away from the time of this writing, it could be the case that we don't have to wait too long before hearing more about this new enhanced edition. We'll see what the week holds.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, Tuesday, August 19, 2025, that's 45-minutes long, featuring legendary game director and designer Masahiro Sakurai, that's all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>The news first broke on the Nintendo Today app, before being published to social media, as we've seen Nintendo do several times now regarding major news and updates for its products. It'll kick off at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Aug 19 at 6am PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders/status/1957432749125779831">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Kirby Air Riders account reads. "<em>The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be the first we've seen of the first non-Smash Bros. game from Sakurai in years, and the first Switch 2 game directed by Sakurai. The game is also currently set to release sometime later this year, so it's likely that tomorrow's presentation will also include an official release date announcement, along with a bevy of information and gameplay footage of what to expect from the follow-up to the 2003 GameCube title, Kirby Air Ride.</p>
