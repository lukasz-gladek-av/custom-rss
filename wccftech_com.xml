			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 580.88) for its GeForce graphics cards. It's optimized for the upcoming game Mafia: The Old Country, due to launch on August 8, as well as the highly acclaimed JRPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-1-4-0-patch-is-now-live-introducing-nvidia-dlss-and-intel-xess-frame-generation-support-visual-polish-across/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> yesterday, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has introduced NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation with update 1.4. NVIDIA has confirmed though that this actually extends to DLSS Multi Frame Generation, allowing owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs to run the game at even higher frame rates. </p>



<p>A recent update also added DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA support to the popular open world zombie survival game 7 Days to Die. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation in the game, with the option to activate DLSS Multi Frame Generation via the NVIDIA app override feature.</p>



<p>Today marks the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Take</a>, a first-person psychological horror game crafted by Surgent Studios, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera</a>. Featuring a cast of acclaimed actors (Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and even Remedy's Sam Lake), Dead Take offers players a nightly visit to a not-so-common haunted mansion. The game will include day one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, here's a video of F1 25 showing off its path tracing glory with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation accelerating frame rates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also had another announcement to make: after a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, GeForce GPUs based on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will transition to receiving quarterly security updates for the next three years (through October 2028). The company notes that lifetime support will reach up to 11 years, 'well beyond' industry standards. Furthermore, they will extend Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system's planned end-of-life, to ensure gamers continue to receive the latest day zero optimizations for new games and apps.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this Game Ready driver (580.88) adds support for 62 new G-SYNC Compatible displays. NVIDIA also fixed several bugs, as noted <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/580.88/580.88-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the driver's changelog</a>:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-2-remake-fanmade-project-to-get-playable-tech-demo-screenshots-show-major-visual-upgrades.1257912/</guid>

			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilities—a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>
