			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> fans and the rest of the video game industry are still reeling from the fact that <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, a long-running and beloved studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">was <strong>shut down</strong> by <strong>Sony</strong> just last week</a>. It's another closure that is difficult to wrap your head around, but a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has just shined a bit more light on how things broke down, and also revealed that Bluepoint had indeed pitched the game that everyone wanted them to make: a <strong>Bloodborne Remake</strong>. Only for it to get shut down by <strong>FromSoftware</strong>.</p>



<p>You're likely wondering how that even works, because while FromSoftware created and developed Bloodborne, <strong>Sony</strong> and PlayStation own the IP. They can, theoretically, do what they want with it, with or without FromSoftware's involvement. </p>



<p>Of course, the extra layers to this include the fact that no one would take any kind of Bloodborne project that didn't involve FromSoftware seriously, whether it was a remake, remaster, or a Bloodborne sequel, but if Sony wanted to try and tell players to kick rocks and make something Bloodborne related anyone, they could do it, on paper.</p>



<p>The other layer is something that Bloomberg's report notes that we heard from PlayStation veteran and video games industry icon, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/">Shuhei Yoshida</a></strong>. When his retirement went into effect at the beginning in 2025, the day after he was officially retired, he did an interview with Kinda Funny Games, during which he was asked about why nothing has ever been done about Bloodborne, despite it being one of the most beloved titles within PlayStation's portfolio.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">Yoshida's theory</a> is that FromSoftware, and specifically its president, <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/">would not be against</a> bringing Bloodborne into the modern age with a native <strong>PS5</strong> port or a new <strong>PC</strong> version, but Miyazaki wants to be the one leading the project. He doesn't want another team to do it, he wants it to be a project that FromSoftware takes on.</p>



<p>"<em>I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created," </em>Yoshida said<em>. "I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em>"</p>



<p>Today's report from Bloomberg seems to corroborate Yoshida's theory. After Bluepoint got the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> out the door and worked on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> as a support studio, we know the team moved on to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live service game</strong>,</a> one that the report adds some previously unknown info on.</p>



<p>It was reportedly going to feature <strong>Atreus</strong> falling into <strong>Hades</strong>, not as in Atreus would land in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/"><strong>Supergiant's</strong> beloved indie game,</a> as in it would bring Atreus out of the Norse setting and into the series' original Greek setting, featuring Atreus fighting his way through Hell. The game was supposed to have some kind of cooperative elements to it, but Bluepoint ultimately struggled to land on a game design and gameplay loop that could keep players engaged in the long-term way that is required in live service titles. It was then cancelled at the start of 2025.</p>



<p>It's at this point, according to Schreier's report, that Bluepoint pitched a Bloodborne Remake. Sony was reportedly on board with the idea, and it also wasn't the first time that Bluepoint had brought it up, which is arguably why we've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">hearing rumours for years</a> that a Bloodborne Remaster/Remake project was on the way.</p>



<p>Once again though, the pitch was unsuccessful, as the report adds, "<em>the studio was told that the numbers made sense but <strong>FromSoftware didn't want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process</strong></em>."</p>



<p>So it seems like there's some weight to Yoshida's theory, or at least to the theory that either Miyazaki himself or FromSoftware as company will be the ones to make the call as to when a Bloodborne remaster/remake/sequel happens, if it happens at all.</p>



<p>The report adds that after the Bloodborne Remake was shut down once again, it tried to go back to the hits and pitched another version of <strong>Shadow of the Colossus</strong> that got rejected by Sony. Bluepoint tried pitching games in other Sony franchises as a way to still try and make something original, like a spin-off <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong> game, but ultimately nothing got through.</p>



<p>Then, when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">God of War Remake Trilogy</a></strong> was revealed, and Bluepoint knew it wouldn't be working on it, that seemed to signal to them that it was over. A week after that reveal, we learned that Bluepoint was getting shuttered. An upsetting end to an altogether upsetting story.</p>
