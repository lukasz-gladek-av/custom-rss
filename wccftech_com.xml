			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster in terms of it being a very-well done boost in graphical fidelity from the original, but it's also great because it was more than just the original game with a graphics boost.</p>
<p>It also included a new expansion called In the Beginning, with 18 new puzzles to solve, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of which</a> were actually made in collaboration with members of the Talos Principle's community.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that they are some of the most difficult puzzles in the whole series. They're not impossible, mind you, they're just very difficult. The thing is that there's always a trick to them, and if you want a hint for Subway Escape before getting the whole solution, the hint here is that creating redundancies will take you far.</p>
<p>That's your hint, but if you just want to know the steps to solve the puzzle, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Subway Escape Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you walk into the Subway Escape puzzle area, it's immediately a bit confusing. There's a subway cart in the center of the room behind a fence and two shields on one side. You also can't head forward across the tracks, due to the walls being lined with turrets. Solving Subway Escape, thankfully, has nothing to do with these elements. Everything about the puzzle begins when you walk through the purple forcefield on the left side of the room and pick up the jammer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer and head around the corner towards the shield blocking the path to an elevator. Use the jammer on the shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Turn around and grab the connector you walked by on your way to the elevator, and take the elevator down with the connector in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the bottom floor, you'll see another jammer (J2) keeping a shield in front of you deactivated. Walk into the room and grab J2 to deactivate the shield on the right-hand side of the room. Then, use the connector to connect the red laser generator to the red node, creating a redundancy with J2, and the red laser, keeping the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up J2 and walk it to the other side of the shield so you can keep the shield deactivated while grabbing the connector and bringing it to the corner of the room.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use J2 to deactivate the shield blocking your path to the fan, pressure switch, and hexahedron behind the shield on your right.&nbsp;Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, pick up the connector, and jump on the fan to fly up to the second level.&nbsp;Head down the stairs and walk towards the middle of the room so that you can place the connector in a spot where you can connect it to the blue node and blue laser generator on the bottom level. This has now created a redundancy with the shield J2 is deactivating and the blue laser.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the bottom level and grab J2. Fly back up to the second level with J2 in hand, and place it next to the connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and jump back down to the bottom floor so that you can leave the connector on the pressure switch that activates the fan, and carry the hexahedron up with you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll have noticed that so far, we've been ignoring the second hexahedron sitting on the purple forcefield, and that's because we haven't needed it yet. Grab it, and the other hexahedron and place them both beside J2.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>This next part is simple, but a little tedious. You simply have to use the hexahedrons to 'walk' across the purple forcefield. If you fall off the hexahedrons, you'll have to reset, so don't fall off. Step by step, while staying on top of the hexahedrons, make your way across the purple forcefield to the other side with J2 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedrons on the two pressure switches to deactivate the shield in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With J2 in hand, walk through the deactivated shield to jump back down to the bottom floor, and take the elevator back up to the top floor.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now, take both J2 and J1 back to the purple forcefield you walked through to get into this area, and use them to deactivate the two layers of shields blocking the way to the subway cart and the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino inside the cart to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll be able to take the subway cart through the hall of turrets and to the next puzzle, which is arguably the most difficult puzzle included in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wont-stop-ai-generated-thumbnails-on-fortnite-says-gen-ai-will-become-more-and-more-difficult-to-detect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games project management director Dan Walsh confirms that Epic won't be making the effort to stop Fortnite creators from using AI-generated thumbnails, due in part because Walsh believes that generated AI content will "<em>become more and more difficult to detect</em>."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">Mustard Plays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-wont-police-ai-generated-thumbnail-images-and-epic-games-says-detecting-them-will-likely-become-impossible">Eurogamer</a>), Walsh and executive vice president Sax Persson were both insistent that Epic itself wouldn't be using generative AI in its own creations such as Fortnite skins, but that when it comes to user's content, Epics' concerns are more geared towards whether the content is "<em>compliant with [its] rules</em>," rather than being concerned with how the users made that content.</p>
<p>"<em>From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails,</em>" Walsh said. "<em>All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect</em>," Walsh continued. "<em>It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?</em>"</p>
<p>Generative AI is becoming more prevalent across the industry, with every major company and creator trying to figure out where it fits, if it does, in their process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-boss-doesnt-think-gen-ai-will-replace-game-creators/">Larian Studio boss Swen Vincke</a> recently commented that, in his view, generative AI might be able to make the "<em>baseline</em>" of what people can make go up, but it won't replace artists, and that if you tried to use generative AI for everything, you won't have a competitive advantage.</p>
