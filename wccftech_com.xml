This update will be adding a familiar face, as well as some new features and challenges for players to take on.</p>
<p>Last making an appearance in Monster Hunter Rise, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune will be making a return and heading into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Players will be able to unlock the mission by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest once they are Hunter Rank 21.</p>

<p>As well as Mizutsune making a return, Arch-tempered Rey Dau will be making a debut in an Event Quest for players above Hunter Rank 50. This is designed for players who enjoy a challenge and want something that is beyond the Tempered monster hunts. Additionally, there will be a new Rey Dau Gamma armor set that players can forge as a reward.</p>
<p>Once players have reached Hunter Rank 50, there will also be a mission unlocked where players can hunt Zoh Shia again, where players will then be able to gather Zoh Shia parts for high-rank Hunter and Palico equipment.</p>
