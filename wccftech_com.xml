			<p>If there's one thing that should be known about me, it's that <strong>I am a Trekkie</strong>. You can keep your <strong>Obi-Wan</strong>, the <strong>Solos</strong>, and the <strong>Skywalkers</strong>. I will pick <strong>Jean-Luc Picard</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Sisko</strong>, and <strong>Kathryn Janeway</strong> every day of the week. That's what makes <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong> such a compelling title to me. Even if I hadn't been sent a copy to review, I would have bought this because, as I've said, Star Trek.</p>



<p>Now, with my love of the source material out in the open, I'm going to say that <strong>this has the potential to really work for Trek fans, particularly fans of the Voyager voyage</strong>, but there are elements of it that may put people off. Before I start, though, I want to say how much I love listening to the Voyager theme on the main menu.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-02-Voyager-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's get the actual story out of the way. <strong>It's Star Trek: Voyager</strong>. The initial cutscenes show the Voyager getting yeeted to the Delta Quadrant, and you take over from there. Throughout the story, <strong>you have opportunities to change how it plays out</strong>. The first choice can actually finish your playthrough in a matter of minutes; will you use the caretaker's relay to send you back? It is an option, but one that takes away from exploring "what could have been".</p>



<p>Sometimes these choices are key parts of the core timeline; other times, side-quests that cover the filler episodes, and it can result in you getting crew members that were only vaguely touched upon in the show. Tuvix, or two versions of B'Elanna (I got those), or another is the extremely well-remembered <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Pelk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelk</a>. Sometimes, <strong>your decisions can also result in you getting technology that can be a massive boost elsewhere in the game</strong>, helping you through some moments where you are meant to fail.</p>



<p><strong>It's something I genuinely enjoy about Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I don't remember all the events of the show; it's been a few years since I re-watched it, but there are elements I remember, and being able to change events and make my own journey is something that I find really compelling. Could I have done a better job than Janeway? Would I have gotten rid of Tuvix? The answers are maybe, and yes, yes, I would.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-03-Tuvix-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It's difficult for me to mark down the game when it comes to story for the simple reason that it has the story of an excellent show to follow, and even expand on, and it does that well. <strong>Now we come to where Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown will likely put a number of people off</strong>, and that's the presentation of this story, and, arguably, a chunk of the gameplay around it.</p>



<p><strong>The story is presented almost universally in text</strong>. At the start of each chapter (sector), you'll get a little voiceover from what I believe are the original actors who played Tom Paris and Tuvok, and that's the extent of any audio dialogue. Everything else is in text, and that could - and likely will - put some people off. We're talking adventure-game or choose-your-own-story book levels of text.</p>



<p><strong>Every choice is text-based</strong>, with a percentage success chance based on varying factors - from a character's level to the level of a certain room within your ship (more on that later). <strong>There are also away-team missions, which are - again - text-based affairs</strong>, with you being given three options of what to do, and your chance of success is based on the ability of the character (or multiple) you choose to take the action, provided they have that particular ability.</p>



<p>Now, that is at least somewhat tactical. <strong>You are shown before you select the characters which abilities you are going to be able to choose from in the event, so you can plan ahead</strong>, since every time you use a character, they will be fatigued for the next step, meaning it is always best to rotate and give yourself the best chance to get through an event. Even better when you level up your characters, keep morale high, and their skills can net you an even bigger success, giving you extra rewards and experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-04-Away-Team-Success-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Outside of the text-heavy gameplay, <strong>there is a bit of combat</strong>. Again, it's a little tactical. You can choose which part of an enemy ship to target and assign energy to different elements of your ship. You can also order your ship to protect a certain side if the shields have been knocked out. <strong>It's a shame you don't have direct control over your ship</strong>, as there are times when it seems to be unable to circle an enemy, something that seems to happen all the time when facing larger enemies like Borg cubes.</p>



<p>Would it have been nice to have had full control over the ship? Of course, though, with the clear budget offering of Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, <strong>I'm not going to hold it against it.</strong> I could also argue that, narratively, you are Captain Janeway, and she gave orders to the crew; she didn't take control and fly the Voyager herself. We're getting into Star Trek: Bridge Crew levels of detail now, though.</p>



<p>This is to say that the combat is quite hands-off, but it works. Which brings us to the other core aspect of the game, <strong>survival and exploration</strong>. Each sector has a number of systems for you to move between, letting you pop to different systems, asteroid belts, or other points of interest, to gather resources. <strong>I would argue the game likely goes a little too far with its resource management</strong>, with 10 different resources to keep track of. You can add another three if you count crew, the number of worker crews (needed to build, repair, or upgrade rooms), and your crew's morale.</p>



<p>Add to this resource caps, unless you build storage rooms for the four core resources, bio labs for borg nanites, and another, the impact on morale if you don't have enough beds for your crew, and more, and <strong>it becomes a fraught balancing act</strong>. Especially as you're wanting to upgrade rooms for extra benefits, upgrade your engine for more power, and essentially turn Voyager into a superweapon.</p>



<p>Adding to this balancing act is the fact that <strong>if you stay in a sector for too long, morale starts to deteriorate as the crew becomes increasingly homesick</strong>. Of course, if you're like me, you want to stay in a system as long as possible, as you can use the free time to research even more scientific advancements, essentially farming to buff yourself for the endgame.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-05-Science-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Much like other similar survival games, of which <strong>FTL: Faster than Light</strong> is the only one I can currently think of, it is a balancing act, and you need to decide what's best for you and your crew. I will say that <strong>I genuinely enjoyed the time I've spent playing Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, and there will be a reasonable amount of replay value in discovering where the side-stories and the paths not taken lead.</p>



<p>If I have two criticisms, and I do, it's that <strong>the side characters I had survive seem to be done dirty in the end credits</strong>. The actual surviving characters of the show get their text outtros, explaining how they fared, and the characters who didn't survive in the actual series get what feels like a perfunctory "Janeway swelled with pride as they lived happily ever after". The remaining criticism is that, <strong>aesthetically, it's a mixed bag</strong>. The UI is a bit clunky, and visuals in combat feel like they were just the still models downsized. A minor thing that didn't honestly bother me, I play Football Manager after all, but some may have an issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, <strong>I do genuinely enjoy Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I am certainly the target audience: someone who loves Star Trek, someone who likes playing this sort of tactical game, and someone who is a fan of these types of stories. If you're some of the above, I would say <strong>give the game a go</strong>, even if it isn't a masterpiece.</p>

					<h2>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a text and story-heavy trek that follows the story of Voyager as it returns from the Delta Quadrant, but allowing you to change the events of the story in a game that has impactful choices wrapped around an FTL-style survival game and copious amounts of resource management. Not a masterpiece, the sum feels like more than the whole, though I will admit my view may be clouded as a fan of Star Trek, Voyager and the genre.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Well detailed story, with a number of branching elements, with even side-stories feeling valuable to explore and complete.
</li><li>Good resource management, if possibly a bit much for some, that fits in well with the survival theme of the game.
</li><li>Offers a good tactical range, particularly in building, which can make you self-sufficient in some resources. Makes you think &amp; plan.</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Aesthetically a mixed bag, with a clunky UI and somewhat choppy combat visuals.
</li><li>The ship in combat can seem to take your orders as vague suggestions.
</li><li>End credits of non-surviving (in the show) characters feel perfunctory.</li>						</ul>

			<p>As far as triple-A-ish games go, <strong>Highguard</strong> might go down in history as one of the games that spent the least time in the spotlight, and even when it did, it was all for the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>The game <strong>was a complete secret</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until The Game Awards 2025</a>. The CEO of game developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Dusty Welch, </strong>would later reveal that their original goal was to <strong>shadowdrop the game</strong> in late January, much as <strong>Respawn's Apex Legends</strong> did back in 2019 (on which several members of the team had worked). However, when <strong>Geoff Keighley</strong> suddenly came to Wildlight with the offer to close out The Game Awards ceremony with a Highguard trailer, Welch felt it would have been foolish to refuse.</p>



<p>As they say, <strong>hindsight is 20/20</strong>, but there's no doubt that <strong>that unveiling has backfired majorly</strong>. Viewers wanted to see a big new <span>single-player game as the show's closing announcement, not another hero shooter, and&nbsp;<strong>immediately criticized both Keighley and Highguard itself</strong>, setting the stage for&nbsp;</span>negative sentiment that hit the game like a hammer.</p>



<p>Rather than delaying the game and perhaps trying to address some of the early complaints, Wildlight <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still launched Highguard as planned</a></strong> in late January. Unsurprisingly, the Steam page <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly filled with negative reviews</a></strong>, just as Dusty Welch had admitted the trailer didn't showcase their game well.</p>



<p>Last week, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Wildlight <strong>had already been forced to lay off most of the team</strong>, following the game's terrible launch. A few days ago, one of the developers who was laid off <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized players</a> for failing to give Highguard a chance</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, <strong>the game appears to be on its deathbed</strong>. The 24-hour concurrent player peak on Steam was just 1,507 players, and the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> has been down for several hours. Those few players who actually enjoy the game are worried its closure might be announced at any moment. Meanwhile, Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Chinese giant <strong>Tencent</strong>, one of the biggest gaming publishers, was the secret investor behind the game. </p>



<p>What do you think of Highguard and its seemingly brief life? Did it deserve more or not? Let us know in the poll and comments.</p>

However, there are times when a game's optimization is judged based on a game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra settings</strong>, which creates a situation where developers—such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-nintendo-switch/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a></em></strong> <strong>PC</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS5,</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> version developer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PH3's Peter "Durante" Thoman</strong>—have to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protect players from themselves"</em> and balance optimization with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proofing</strong> their games.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19632-ys-x-proud-nordics-durante-interview-ph3-switch-2-dlss-ps5-pro-switch-1-trails-beyond-the-horizon-port-challenges-tea-2026-exclusive">RPGFan</a></em></strong>, the legendary developer, who some may remember for fixing the flawed PC port of the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dark Souls</em></strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19">DSFix</a></strong>, was asked for clarification about the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protecting players from themselves"</em> statement made when talking about the PC port of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Trails beyond the Horizon</em></strong> regarding some players cranking up the settings to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra</strong> and complain about optimization.</p>



<p><em>"I don’t think it’s 'a lot' of players, but this does happen. And it is very annoying – not (just) because it’s our work, but because it’s genuinely <strong>counter-productive</strong>,"</em> Durante said. <em>"We try very hard to implement a huge amount of settings in order to make our <strong>PC versions scale</strong> from low-power devices like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> all the way to an RGB-riddled gaming rig with a <strong>500 Watt monster GPU</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Not many PC ports offer this level of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">scalability</strong> nowadays, <span>which creates a critical issue, according to the&nbsp;<em><strong>developer of the Ys X: Proud Nordics</strong></em>&nbsp;port</span>. </p>



<p><em>"That’s the crux: as a developer, we get to decide what e.g. <strong>'Ultra'</strong> means. And people judging the <strong>'optimization'</strong> of a game based on how it runs at <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong> creates <strong>perverse incentives</strong> for this,"</em> Durante said. <em>"Taking this to its logical conclusion, if we were to remove the <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong>, rename <strong>'Very High' to 'Ultra'</strong>, and make no other changes, then this metric would say that our game is now much more <strong>'optimized'</strong>."</em></p>



<p>With this widespread misperception, it's not easy for any developer to offer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">highly scalable settings</strong> that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof</strong> games. However, there's plenty of value in doing so. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"As a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC gaming enthusiast</strong> for over 20 years now, going back to older games with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new hardware</strong> and seeing them in a new light is something I greatly enjoy – and disincentivizing developers from adding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">high-end options</strong> goes directly against that,"</em> Durante concluded.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Durante’s stance</strong> is a call for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nuanced understanding</strong> of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC and console performance</strong>, which seems to have been lost in the past few generations. By refusing to cap a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC port's settings</strong> to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console equivalent</strong>, or only slightly beyond it, developers would prioritize the platform's greatest asset: its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">longevity</strong>. </p>



<p>I’ve experienced this firsthand when <strong>revisiting older</strong> titles like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>. Seeing it <strong>scale to modern resolutions and framerates</strong> years later is what makes PC gaming unique. If CD Projekt Red had <strong>capped those settings back then to match the hardware of the time</strong>, I would have never experienced the game in the new light Durante mentioned.</p>



<p>Hopefully, more developers will offer more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof Ultra settings</strong>, although with the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remasters</strong> consistently getting announced, I don't personally believe this will happen anytime soon.</p>
