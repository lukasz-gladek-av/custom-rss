			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>

			<p>Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent has increased its stake in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, edging closer to Sony's shares in the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-additional-shares-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a> today, Japanese publication Nikkei revealed that Tencent has increased its stake in the company by 1.11%, bringing it to 7.97%. The Chinese conglomerate confirmed the company had increased its share in FromSoftware's parent company as part of a <em>"capital business alliance"</em> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Despite increasing its share ratio, Tencent still isn't the largest shareholder in Kadokawa. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/">December</a>, Sony and Kadokawa confirmed that the two companies had entered a strategic capital and business alliance that made Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa stock. The alliance will allow Kadokawa to realize the company's Global Media Mix strategy, which involves the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is only one of the game development studios owned by Kadokawa, but it is definitely the most popular. The creator of the Souls series is now working on an Elden Ring spin-off called Elden Ring: Nightreign which combines mechanics from the main game with roguelike elements to provide a co-op experience that has ton of potential, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-to-last-30%E2%80%9340-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content.1125675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At a recent Assassin's Creed Shadows showcase event in Japan, Ubisoft Quebec Creative Director Jonathan Dumont discussed the estimated length of the upcoming open world game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1xnfk2J98Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Genki Gamer</a>, he said that the studio expects the main story to last at least thirty to forty hours, while the whole game could last more than eighty hours when accounting for all the side content.</p>
<p>That's certainly a hefty amount, although a bit less than the gargantuan Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which required 61 hours just for the main story and could last up to nearly 150 hours for a full completionist run, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the website HowLongToBeat</a>. Admittedly, Valhalla's quests and missions weren't always memorable, and gamers nowadays have loudly expressed their disdain for fetch quests and the like. Hopefully, the new installment can deliver higher quality content on average.</p>
<p>For Ubisoft, it would be an understatement to say that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher had to deal with multiple underwhelming commercial launches, including Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. The shorter spin-off game Assassin's Creed Mirage did well enough, but now Ubisoft needs a big win. It's why they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows twice</a> in a desperate attempt to improve the game and make sure it hits the intended mark.</p>
<p>Bringing players to the long-requested setting of 16th-century Japan, toward the end of the Sengoku era, the game features dual protagonists Fujibayashi Naoe and Yasuke, a shinobi and a samurai, respectively. Ubisoft Quebec has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that players could stick with their preferred protagonist for most of the game if they so choose, though there will be some things that one is much better at than the other, and at some point, the game might force you to switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-off-the-improved-anvil-engine-shares-new-tech-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version of the Anvil engine</a> delivers interesting improvements to the stealth gameplay, too. For the first time in the franchise, hiding in the shadows will actually make the player character invisible to their enemies. This means that during nighttime, every shaded spot will become a dynamic hiding spot in which the players can advance themselves further, both indoors and outdoors. Players can even destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens, creating new shadowed spots. Moreover, the dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth as well. When it's raining, the sound covers the player's footsteps. Rain also makes changes to enemy patrols, as some NPCs will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation won't be there in the winter months.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to debut on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1896969076884562078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has surpassed six million players, adding that such a scope is 'hard to comprehend' but the studio is 'incredibly thankful' to the community.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean six million users have purchased the game. That's because STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been available on Game Pass from day one, making it difficult to discriminate between real buyers and subscription users who found the game bundled in their library.</p>
<p>Still, it sounds like GSC Game World is happy enough so far. Moreover, while there has been no mention of a PlayStation 5 version, the console exclusivity <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is believed to be timed</a>. Eventually, STALKER 2 should also launch on Sony's console, opening up to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>The developer still has a long road ahead when it comes to post-launch support, anyway. The game should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to include hardware-enhanced ray tracing, official mod tools with cross-platform mod integration, and even a multiplayer mode, about which we know practically nothing so far. On top of those, there are also two upcoming expansions that were sold as part of the Season Pass, included with the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The base game is well worth playing, if a bit too rough, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
