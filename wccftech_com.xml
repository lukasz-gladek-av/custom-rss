			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-fbc-firebreak-battlefield-2042-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-and-more/">announced</a> the nine games that are being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for June 2025, with the two biggest titles being Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, the latter of which is launching into the service on June 17, 2025.</p>
<p>Along with Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, other notable titles PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can play beginning on June 17, 2025, include Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2, and We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. PS Plus Premium subscribers will also be able to dive back into the world of Deus Ex, with Deus Ex: The Conspiracy being the lone addition to the PS Plus Premium Classic's Catalog for June 2025.</p>
<p>Here's the full list for all nine games that'll be available to subscribers on June 17:</p>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wilds (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak are arguably the two major games added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs this month, having Battlefield in this month's batch of games won't feel like much of anything for subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-march-2023-battlefield-2042-extra-premium-uncharted-ghostwire/">In March 2023,</a> Battlefield 2042 was the headlining game for the PS Plus Essential's tier three monthly games. Anyone who is subscribed to PS Plus at all, without needing to go to the higher tiers, likely already has Battlefield 2042 in their library of games they got through PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>This also makes for two straight months of Battlefield games being added to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalog, because<a href="https://wccftech.com/sandland-battlefield-v-and-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-included-in-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-may-2025/"> May 2025's additions included Battlefield V</a>. Another game which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-may-2021-games-godfall-disco-elysium-battlefield-v/">previously been one of the three free games offered for Essential tier subscribers</a>, even before PlayStation officially switched to its new tiered PlayStation Plus structure.</p>
<p>At least FBC: Firebreak is an entirely new addition for subscribers to enjoy this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">Remedy also just detailed</a> what Firebreak players will be getting in two major free updates coming to the game post-launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warframe to Get Isleweaver Update on June 25]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25.1215768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes revealed that the next large Warframe update called Isleweaver will be released on all platforms on June 25.</p>
<p>Players who have completed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> quest 'The Hex' will have access to an expanded Kingdom of Duviri. They will face Major Rusalka once again in the emotionally turbulent Kingdom of Duviri, alongside new threats to this region such as The Murmur and the looming presence of The Indifference. Activities include collecting lore fragments to reveal narrative secrets, discovering the new island of Scholar’s Landing and unraveling the mystery behind Rusalka’s reign, before facing off against the latest Warframe, Oraxia, in a new mini-boss battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isleweaver introduces Operation: Eight Claw. Here, players partner with Dominus Thrax to earn exclusive event rewards by reclaiming Scholar’s Landing and Duviri’s throne from Major Rusalka and the Murmur in a new Clan Operation. Search the area for lore fragments to learn more about Rusalka's story and the current state of Duviri's kingdom. During Operation: Eight Claw, previous Clan Operation rewards will be available to earn again until Wednesday, 16 July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Isleweaver Official Teaser - Coming in June!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBsQROfuf0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All players will have access to Oraxia, the 61st Warframe, known as the mistress of fear. Oraxia can isolate and execute weakened foes, poison enemies, imbibe marked enemies for buffs and summon spiderling swarms like a good broodmother would from the corpses of the fallen. Two new weapons will be added to the Warframe arsenal alongside Oraxia: the Scyotid barb cluster throwing weapon and the Spinnerex poison whip.</p>
<p>There are also new Deluxe Cosmetics and TennoGen. Explore new facets of Citrine with the latest Deluxe Collection, including the Citrine Aphrodita Skin, the Corazon Syandana and other bejewelled cosmetics, all of which have been given a new look. Players can also take their Fashion Frame game to the next level and collect new TennoGen cosmetics to adorn their Warframes, weapons and operators with new, community-designed customisations when Isleweaver launches.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also reiterated its commitment to refining Warframe's first impressions for new players this year with the launch of Isleweaver. A revamped onboarding tutorial has been introduced in one of the first quests, Vor's Prize, which modernizes the boss fight. Players may also experiment with a rework of Valkyr’s gameplay, which changes her ability kit to allow for a faster, more aggressive playstyle that caters to her melee-focused kit.</p>
<p>More announcements will be made during <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TennoCon</a>, which will take place on July 18-19 in London, Ontario, Canada. It should be a special event, given that it's the tenth year of the fan-focused Warframe convention.</p>

			<p>The moon has always been a spot of interest and wonder that humankind has dreamed about reaching and finally setting foot on, if briefly. Establishing moon bases and creating a permanent foothold on the barren landscape is something that humanity still has not completely mastered in this day and age. In science fiction, when you leave Earth and set up a colony elsewhere, there’s probably a good reason for leaving God’s green Earth. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">PRAGMATA</a>, the journey is about doing the exact opposite: escaping the confines of the lunar stations and returning to Earth, not just by yourself but with a young girl/android named Diana along with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">PRAGMATA</a> is much more than an escort mission. While the playable astronaut controls all of the movement and offensive capabilities, the young Diana riding piggyback along the way has some serious hacking prowess. As players dodge and shoot their way through autonomous death machines and androids, Diana can simultaneously hack through the enemy’s defenses. On paper, this sounds arduous with having to juggle between moving on one analog stick, aiming with another, firing with the shoulder buttons, and trying to navigate through a hacking minigame with Diana on the face buttons. In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core. In practice, the earlier hacking segments only took a second or two to move your little avatar around and collect the requisite nodes in order to disable the enemy shields.</p>
<p>There is a few weapons at the player’s disposal in PRAGMATA early on, each having its own mechanics and capabilities beyond just shooting and dealing damage. The player’s signature pistol has infinite ammo and takes time to recharge, while other weapons picked up off the ground might only have a clip or two before they’re discarded and replaced with something else. There’s a variety of energy weapons, and I leaned more into the energy shotgun type when it came to blasting my way through the brief demo.</p>
<p>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idx9z6ke3tc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that Capcom has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxCboik0Is">five years ago today</a>. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</p>
<p>There’s still some time to go before this adventure is ready for players’ hands as PRAGMATA will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>
