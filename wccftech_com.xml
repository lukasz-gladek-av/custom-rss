			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>

			<p>PlayStation porting its first-party, console-exclusive games to PC should have always been a full slam-dunk for the company, as everyone (save for some console warriors, probably) can get behind more people being able to play good games where they want to play them.</p>
<p>But the company's new multi-platform approach has been plagued by PlayStation seemingly shooting itself in the foot, by trying to force players to link their Steam accounts with a PlayStation Network account, and blocking its games, even the ones it only published, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/">Stellar Blade</a>, from being sold in the 100+ countries where PSN is not available.</p>
<p>It started being a major issue with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">Helldivers 2</a>, and has since been a talking point with every port of a PlayStation game to PC. However, as spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lrj3gsdkr22v">Wario64</a>, it looks like PlayStation is starting to see the light. Region restrictions for God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Helldivers 2, have all been removed.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrj3gsdkr22v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia24z2us5mamqq7fuzivp5cmyswoghpufymdjvsktqboo7fvh62nq">
<p lang="en">Sony appears to be removing regional restrictions on their Steam/PC games God of War Ragnarok steamdb.info/sub/833972/h...The Last of Us Part II Remastered steamdb.info/sub/1219787/...Spider-Man 2 steamdb.info/sub/1219797/...Helldivers 2 steamdb.info/sub/137730/h...</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is a sign that we won't have to have the conversation around region locking when it comes to PlayStation games on PC again. The recently released Days Gone Remastered didn't launch with region locks, and now that we're seeing them removed from older releases, this saga seems to finally be over.</p>
<p>Which is great for all involved. It never made sense in the first place that PlayStation would bring its games to Steam, with the intention of getting players who may not have access to a PlayStation or choose not to play on a console for one reason or another, only to block those players specifically in over 100 regions around the world, from playing their games.</p>
