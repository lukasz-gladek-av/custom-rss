			<p>In a new gameplay trailer shared by IGN, players get a glimpse at what's to come in STALKER 2 and what weaponry and ammo will be available. It also shows off the gun attachments you'll get access to throughout the game. Since the original STALKER came out, it's been 17 years, and there have been major technological advancements since then. STALKER 2 is set to use Unreal Engine 5, and so far, all teasers and trailers have showcased amazing graphics. However, games using Unreal Engine 5 have been known to be temperamental. Despite this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/">the developers have promised</a> that the game will remain stable at all times. If you want to know what weapons and kit you can expect in STALKER 2, make sure to check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the video, the graphics and environments shown are absolutely stunning and are extremely detailed. It shows off how you can loot from bodies on the ground, as well as what your inventory will look like, something that can be a huge deterrent in games, depending on how it's handled. In the video, it seems as if each item you pick up is a specific shape or size, and you will be required to do a bit of Tetris to be able to fit items together. This sort of inventory is often seen in survival games and is commonly seen in the Resident Evil franchise. This can be fun but also serves as its own challenge. Each item also has its own weight, which can lead to over-encumbrance if you carry too much, as shown in the video.</p>
<p>The video also shows off some of the combat that you can expect in STALKER 2, as well as methods of self-preservation, which includes quickly bandaging yourself in sticky situations. The video released by GSC Game World shows how the world can go from derelict and barren to chaotic and dangerous in seconds, always showing that you have to be on your guard.</p>
<p>There are a variety of weapons that will be available and a lot of different attachments you can get, including 2x and 4x Scopes if you're someone who likes to use Sniper Rifles or want to be stealthy about your kills and take out your enemies from a vantage point.</p>
<p>The release date for STALKER 2 ebbs ever closer and is set for release on November 20 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>, the Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now enhanced for the PS5 Pro, just a year after it was initially released on PS4 and PS5. Ubisoft Bordeaux has been working to release a patch for the game so that it will be enhanced for PS5 Pro when the console officially releases. To make it worth playing on the PS5 Pro, they've made some changes to how the game will run in both Quality and Performance mode on the PS5 Pro. Here is everything you can expect from the Assassin's Creed Mirage Enhanced patch.</p>
<p>Should you be picking up the game for the PS5 Pro, you will be able to play the game in 4K60 with PSSR as the upsampling software to provide "more faithful 4K details at 60 FPS." Quality Mode is now the default setting for the game at 60FPS rather than the 30FPS that it was for the original PS5 version of the game.&nbsp; The improvements have been showcased in a <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1854569510272905389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video</a> that was posted by the official Assassin's Creed account on X.</p>
<p>As a whole, graphics are said to be generally improved, with better shadows and reflection fidelity, as well as higher texture resolution and improved draw distance. Whether this will be enough for people to pick up the game for the PS5 Pro remains to be seen.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise is quite expansive, when it comes to recent titles, Assassin's Creed Mirage wasn't as revered compared to other titles in the franchise, like Black Flag and Valhalla, for example. Despite this, Assassin's Creed Mirage was still the third best-selling retail game in Japan when it was released.</p>
<p>The main issue with Assassin's Creed Mirage was that people felt that the game was too short, and it is listed as one of the lowest-rated games in the franchise. Although it received a ton of positive buzz from critics when the game launched, it's tied for the third lowest-rated Assassin's Creed game in the whole series. Mirage tried to return to the stealthy roots of the fan favorites but didn't quite have the sparkle and charm that the original Assassin's Creed games had.&nbsp; You can read the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">review by Nathan Birch here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest Assassin's Creed game, named Assassin's Creed Shadows, was due for release on November 15 but has since been pushed back for a release on February 15, 2025. Despite not being out yet, the game has caused a significant stir in the community, and people have been actively trying to push for Ubisoft to either scrap the game or remake it entirely away from the story that they were initially trying to create.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Assassin's Creed Mirage for the PS5 Pro?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer.1030245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly three years since Deadline first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Amazon was closing on a deal to adapt Mass Effect into a TV series for its Prime Video channel. Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that the deal is finally done, featuring Daniel Casey as the writer and executive producer of the show. Casey is known primarily for the screenplay of 2018's Kin, a sci-fi feature film, and 2021's Fast &amp; Furious 9. Neither of which were exactly masterpieces, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, Variety also reports that Karim Zreik will executive produce under his Cedar Tree Productions banner. Ari Arad and BioWare's Michael Gamble will also executive produce. Zreik has worked on several successful TV series, such as Jericho and a plethora of Marvel shows (Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Runaways, The Punisher, The Gifted, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Legion, and Helstrom). Ari Arad has produced several feature film adaptations, such as 2004's The Punisher, 2007's Ghost Rider, 2008's Iron Man, 2017's Ghost in the Shell, 2022's Uncharted, and 2024's Borderlands. Finally, Michael Gamble is a BioWare veteran who has worked on every Mass Effect game since the second. He is also leading the project for the next game installment and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would retain the photorealistic style and mature tone of the previous entries.</p>
<p>No details are currently available on the plot or on the casting. For Prime Video, this is yet another gaming adaptation. They've had massive success with Bethesda's Fallout, of course, and they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Like a Dragon: Yakuza last month. Amazon has two more heavy hitting gaming TV series on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>As for Mass Effect, today is N7 Day, so it's a good day for fans to get this near-announcement. There won't be much else, given that BioWare has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, beyond a return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-adds-cross-save-brings-back-mass-effects-normandy-on-n7-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
