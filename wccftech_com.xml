			<p>Concord remains, for now, arguably the greatest commercial failure for Sony and PlayStation in the history of the PlayStation platform. <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">After just ten days on the market</a> between the end of August and the beginning of September 2024, Sony pulled it from store shelves and confirmed servers would go offline, rendering the online-only game unplayable for the few players who bought it. Fast forward to the last few days, and Concord was playable to those with a legal copy of the game courtesy of fan-made custom servers, until Sony killed it once again.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, it began with Sony issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos that were uploaded by the creators behind the project of them playing Concord on the custom servers they built. The takedowns were issued by a company listed as MarkScan, which is generally the face Sony uses to issue claims like this.</p>



<p>Though Sony wasn't directly targeting the project of building custom servers for Concord, just videos of gameplay on these custom servers, shortly after the takedowns came through, one of the lead developers behind the project stated in the Concord Delta Discord, "<em>Due to worrying legal action we've decided</em> <em>to pause invites for the time being</em>."</p>



<p>As previously stated, Sony hasn't attacked the actual project of building the custom servers. It's also worth noting that the developers were being extremely careful to remove and disallow any players from trying to share illegal copies of the game, and would only allow players who had legally obtained a copy of Concord. </p>



<p>"<em>I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do,</em>" the team wrote. "<em>We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files</em>."</p>



<p>So while Sony hasn't directly issued a takedown to the project itself, the indirect action of taking down the videos seems to have been enough for Sony to show the development team that it knows about what they are doing, and it will take every path it can to strike it down. </p>

			<p>It's no mystery that Valve's Steam platform continues to grow at a steady rate. Over the past few years, we've reported several new concurrent peak player records, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recorded a month ago with around 41.6 million users</a> online at the same time.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this also translates into higher sales on the store. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/valves-bold-expected-return-to-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics</a>, Steam has already generated sales for around $16.2 billion in 2025, a 5.7% increase over 2024's estimated $15.33 billion. Do note that 2024's data point is, of course, final, whereas there are still 44 days left in 2025, and it's arguably the period when people spend more due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday sales, Holiday gifts, and so on. It would not be a surprise to see Steam break the $17 billion threshold by year's end.</p>



<p>Valve takes a substantial cut out of each sale conducted on the store: 30% until the product reaches $10 million in revenue, 25% between $10 million and $50 million, and 20% over $50 million. It's one of the ways the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-store-fee-lowered-from-30-to-12-for-pc-games-halo-infinite-will-have-crossplay-and-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later the Microsoft Store</a> have attempted to compete with Valve's store (which many game developers still consider a monopoly) by offering a higher revenue per sale than they can get on Steam. On those stores, developers only pay a 12% fee and get 88% of the sale.</p>



<p>Epic also famously paid hefty sums to secure big temporary game exclusives, such as Borderlands 3, on its store. At one point, Epic founder Tim Sweeney even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-tim-sweeney-promises-forego-exclusive-deals-if/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged Valve to match the Epic Games Store's revenue split</a>, stating that he would have ended the exclusivity program if they agreed to do so.</p>



<p>Valve never flinched, though, thanks to the unwavering loyalty of hundreds of millions of gamers. While Epic did manage to carve for itself a sizable platform on the EGS, between exclusive, free games, and the evergreen Fortnite, Steam did not suffer in the least and, as shown by these figures, keeps growing.</p>



<p>Alinea Analytics estimates that Valve has already earned $4 billion in 2025 from the sales on its store. With these numbers, it's perhaps no wonder that its president, co-founder, and majority stakeholder, Gabe Newell, has a lot of money to spare.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, website Boat International <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/oceanco-y722-superyacht-leviathan-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Newell has just received his latest superyacht, a 111-meter entirely custom wonder called Leviathan. Produced by Oceanco (which was also acquired by the Valve owner earlier this year), it can accommodate up to 22 guests plus 33 crew members. It features two gyms, a spa, a bar, a basketball half-court, a beach club, a small hospital, and, of course, an entertainment room equipped with fifteen top-of-the-line gaming PCs.</p>



<p>With Steam poised to expand its ecosystem even further <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the launches of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller products early next year</a>, Valve's billionaire owner, who recently said he lives full-time at sea but still works remotely on various company projects, will probably be able to afford more of these superyachts in the near future.</p>

			<p>Everstone Studio's Where Winds Meet does a lot of things right, but its AI chatbot NPCs are unironically one of its best features, leading to all sorts of hilarious interactions that players are fully embracing.</p>



<p>Many of the game's NPCs, with which players can build lasting relationships as part of the game's core mechanics, are actually powered by AI chatbots that reply to all sorts of inputs from the player. During the early access review period of the global version, I wasn't able to make them do anything other than repeat some set lines, but now that the game is finally live, these NPCs are fully functional, and players have been testing how much they can be pushed to provide some genuinely fun interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-most-vicious-ai-break-up-child-support-and-grief">The Most Vicious AI Break-Up: Child Support and Grief</h3>



<p>One user on the game's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">official subreddit</a>, MisterZan25, proved to be particularly cruel, subjecting the Zhao Dali NPC to a vicious narrative arc. The player made the NPC believe their character was pregnant with their child, demanded child support, and eventually informed them that the child had died.</p>



<p>The AI NPC believed the entire scenario and reacted dramatically to the news, <strong>providing a moment of dark comedy.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<figure></figure>

<h3 id="h-life-advice-and-martial-arts-moves">Life Advice and Martial Arts Moves</h3>



<p>Not all interactions have to be so destructive in Where Winds Meet. Some kind-hearted players have tried to lift the spirits of some AI NPCs, often resulting in reactions that fit the Wuxia setting.</p>



<p>User lessobvious had a <strong>constructive exchange</strong> with an NPC, successfully lifting their spirits by highlighting the value of training, even after that training had failed to help the NPC find a wife.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User zheiro provided life advice to an AI NPC, who <strong>appreciated the guidance and thanked the user gracefully</strong> in a manner that felt perfectly in line with the game’s aesthetic.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User OtherwiseEnd944, on the other hand, decided to have a little bit of fun with another NPC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1oxmtez/the_ai_is_killing_me/">suggesting a rather "peculiar" martial arts move</a>, which<strong> left the NPC baffled</strong>, proving the system reacts even to the most absurd of interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-taunt-npcs-and-pay-the-price">Taunt NPCs and Pay the Price</h3>



<p>The AI’s reactivity extends beyond mere conversation. Treating the NPCs rudely can lead to believable, and sometimes violent, reactions. User Sensitive_Touch_8190 taunted an AI NPC repeatedly, and after having had enough, <strong>the character retaliated</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if this sort of bizarre, player-driven feature isn't your alley, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Where Winds Meet</strong> has a lot to offer for all sorts of players.
