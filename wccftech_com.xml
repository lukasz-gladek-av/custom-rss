			<p>Another video game to film adaptation has been announced, and this time it's horror movie powerhouse production company Blumhouse announcing that it is collaborating with Kinetic Games to make a Phasmophobia movie.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-film-adaptation-blumhouse"> blog post from Kinetic Games</a>, with the studio's director Daniel Knight saying he is "<em>thrilled</em>" for Kinetic Games to be working with Blumhouse and James Wan's production company, Atomic Monster, on this project.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasomphobia film adaptation is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting</em>," said Knight.</p>
<p>"<em>We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops</em>."</p>
<p>No directors, writers, or cast members have been attached to the film so far, but in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game is a match made in heaven</a>, so is Blumhouse and Atomic Monster taking on any film adaptation of a horror video game, including Phasmophobia. Hopefully, we'll hear more about the film soon.</p>
