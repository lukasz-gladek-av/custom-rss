			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is a game that was previously only available on <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">the Wii U</a>, with the game being released in 2015. However, the game is now making a return and will be coming to the Nintendo Switch with enhanced visuals, new story elements, and much more. For those excited to get their hands on it, this definitive edition will be releasing on 20 March, 2025. To celebrate the announcement of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Nintendo has released a trailer that showcases the graphics, the story, and some of the gameplay features that players can expect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Coming March 20th, 2025 (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKHz71V7Csc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you'll be able to customize your Avatar to look how you want them to, and you get to pick their class as well, which gives you a ton of variety with how expansive the battle system is. Of course, before you get to utilize a Skell, you have to prove yourself to the BLADE organization. Once you've done that, you'll be able to have your very own customizable mech that will help with exploring the vast world of Xenoblade Chronicles X, as well as help you in combat.</p>
<p>This game takes place in the year 2054, where humans have fled Earth due to an intergalactic war. You are one of the remaining survivors of the New Los Angeles (NLA) colony, and you have to help them build a new home on the planet Mira.</p>
<p>As you help them get settled on Mira, you'll get to know some of the people from NLA, help them with their problems, and build bonds with your party members, which will later unlock new quests that can lead to rare gear and items. There will also be multiplayer-specific missions to take part in, allowing you to team up with friends online to play Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition together. If you want to play multiplayer but don't want to team up, you can also take part in Global Nemesis Battles, full of fun and chaos.</p>
<p>If you find that you don't like the characters in the game as party members, you can also recruit the avatars of other players to your team so that they can help you through the main story, somewhat similar to the Pawn system in Dragon's Dogma.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get your hands on this game, you <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can pre-order it now</a>, with the title costing $59.99.</p>
<p>Is Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition a game you'll be picking up?</p>

			<p>Following the expiration of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard review embargo, lots of media and industry people have started sharing their thoughts on BioWare's latest RPG, including Larian Studios Director of Publishing Michael Douse. In a lengthy tweet <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Douse showered the game with high praise:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen). From me, you may be wondering “is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3” so I’ll tackle it from that perspective. </em><em>The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, 9 season long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy Netflix series is.</em></p>
<p><em>It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade &amp; Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements. </em><em>More important, to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, if you want some character driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it’s fun!</em></p>
<p><em>To me, I’m extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times. An existential game, and a fun one at th</em>at.</p>
<p>As I jokingly replied via tweet, it was not quite <em>complete </em>secrecy. I have known Michael for years and have him on my Steam friends list, so I noticed he was playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard while I was also going through it for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. Having said that, as you already know if you read my evaluation of the game, I wholeheartedly agree with Douse's assessment of BioWare's latest work. It should definitely appeal to franchise fans but also to those who enjoyed games like Larian's own masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3. It's different, but there are many common threads that will make fans of Western RPGs happy if they give it a chance.</p>
<p>The game is out in two days on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
