			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes to find across all of its chapters, and it's worth taking the time to seek them out.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of Compulsion's latest title is its storytelling, and these notes are no exception. They add strong context to the story being told, and even if you don't care about that, you'll need to collect them all to grab all the achievements in the game.</p>
<p>Here's where to find the notes in Chapter 13.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 13</h2>
<p>This is the final chapter with notes to find. Thankfully, only two are left, since Chapter 14 has no notes. Once you grab the ones here, you'll have unlocked the Lore Master achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Run, Rabbit, Run -&nbsp;</strong>After the first chase sequence in the level, when you reach the second set, turn right at the first corner, and you'll see a small workshop area. This note is on a desk next to a painting of a rabbit on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Eternally She Waits -&nbsp;</strong>After the next chase sequence, you'll find this final note on a desk next to a typewriter on the third set.</p>
<p>Those are the final two notes to find in the game. Once you've found them both, you'll have found all 103 and unlocked the Lore Master achievement.</p>
