			<p>Marvel Games and NetEase Games have made the announcement that Hawkeye will be joining the launch roster for Marvel Rivals. So far, the roster is pretty nicely stacked and has a lot of variation for those who plan on getting stuck into the game. The release date for Marvel Rivals isn't far away, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-demanding-540p-xbox-series-s/">the game will be launching on December 6</a> with all heroes unlocked and free to play. In addition to Hawkeye's reveal, the dev team has also revealed a new map being added for Wakanda. The map is called Birnin T'Challa and is a built-up, futuristic city in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.</p>

<p>To celebrate all of the announcements they've made, they've released a trailer for Hawkeye and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Ci9jZY11JluGVcqL&amp;v=dz_778SYulo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Birnin T'Challa</a>, respectively, as well as a new dev diary that was released five days ago to talk about some of the decisions they've made for the upcoming hero shooter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYSZFAZC3Kg&amp;t=22s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The dev diary</a> talks about the roadmap of the upcoming game, with the title beginning with Season 0, named "Doom's Rise." This season will be month-long, where players will get to experiment with 33 heroes and eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes. There will also be a Conquest map and a new Practice Range, allowing players to experiment with the superheroes before taking them into a game against other people. The Doom's Rise season is all about the chaos that is caused by Doctor Doom and his time experiments, which is also explained in the dev diary released recently.</p>
<p>Since Season 0 is so short, there will be a battle pass available, but it will have half the content of a full Seasonal Battle Pass, with the battle pass being priced accordingly for the month long season. Additionally, there is an in-game store that will have regular rotations with costumes and cosmetics inspired by the comics, MCU, and costumes that are specifically created to reflect the storyline of Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>These costumes include the Imperial Protocol series, which has Afrofuturism roots and is representative of the empire of Wakanda. As Hawkeye is the latest character to be added to the ever-expanding roster of Marvel Rivals, he is the fourth in the story set to receive an Imperial Protocol costume, with details of the cosmetic set to be revealed sometime soon.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals?</p>

			<p>Following the launch of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for Game of the Year at The Game Awards), Square Enix is now entirely focused on the third part of the FFVII remake trilogy. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-no-dlc-open-world-minigame-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> there won't be any DLCs for Rebirth to speed up the arrival of the final installment, but what can we expect in that game? Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi talked a bit about his plans in an interview with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-mini-games-naoki-hamaguchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VG247</a>, stating that the goal is to add some sort of different twist to make it a new and exciting experience.</p>
<p><em>I play a lot of games, a lot of open world games, and something I feel whilst playing a lot of these games is that you've got the core mechanics - or their fighting systems - and most of the content you'll encounter, most of the places you can go, most of what you'll be doing, can get repetitive. These games just use the same mechanics. There are no real changes, there’s nothing new to experience around the different regions of these worlds.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, there’s a great battle system in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - and there’s a lot of fun to be had in fighting the various different monsters in each region - but I wanted it to feel like a breath of fresh air when you entered each different region. That you feel like there’s something new and exciting to do when you enter a new area. That you can experience something different with the mechanics. That’s why we wanted to put so many different mini-games in, and I feel we really managed to achieve our goal with that. It’s simply a breath of fresh air in an open world (or ‘open field’, as we call it for Rebirth).</em></p>
<p><em>So, are we going to continue with this same balance going forward? Have we reached perfection? I think if we did just do the same thing again for the third game in the series, then it wouldn’t really be very new or exciting anymore. I want to add a different twist, rearrange things slightly for the next game, and have a slightly different look to things. We don’t just want to make more of the same, we want to make new and exciting experiences.</em></p>
<p>There's no telling yet when the next entry of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy will be released, but it will be at least three years. In the meantime, Rebirth is likely to be released on PC.</p>
