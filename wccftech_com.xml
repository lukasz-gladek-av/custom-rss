			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 literally swept the floor during last night's The Game Awards 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning nine out of ten of the prizes it got nominated for</a>, including Game of the Year and Studio of the Year for its developer. It's a massive victory for a relatively small indie team that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent less than $10 million making this title</a>.</p>



<p>As if gamers couldn't love them enough already, the French developer has now dropped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased</a> sizable (and free) new update, version 1.5, which adds new features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0-fsr-4-0-2-now-available-next-gen-neural-rendering-technologies-fsr-redstone-ready-for-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD FSR 4</a> on PC and even new content, such as Verso's Drafts, a new playable environment that takes the characters of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover. Verso's Drafts is located on the world map right next to Lumière and becomes accessible from Act III. Esquie's underwater ability is required to access the environment.</p>



<p>That's far from the only addition of the so-called 'Thank You' update. New Luminas and weapons have been added; there are new costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving players even more customization options; there are new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower, variations of iconic bosses from the main game that are designed to be even more challenging.</p>



<p>The "Old Key" quest item has been added to the final area of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This specific item was previously only obtainable during the game's prologue, so this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough. New text and UI game localizations are available in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come, according to Sandfall.</p>

<p>Update 1.5 also introduces the following features: </p>



<ul>
<li>Lumina Sets, which enable players to save up to 50 different Lumina loadouts, allowing them to adapt their fighting tactics at any moment. </li>



<li>An Abandon Battle option in the pause menu is available and it can now be opened in battle.</li>



<li>A Photo Mode is now in the game with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing their favourite moments from the game. It's accessible at any time from the pause menu.</li>



<li>A HUD Scale setting has been added to the game so that players may adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%.</li>



<li>Input remapping is available for controllers.</li>



<li>The game is now officially certified for the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are, of course, plenty of bug fixes too. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>1381546</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bandai Namco Aces has announced ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during The Game Awards 2025</a>. About a year and a half ago, an actor's resume <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'leaked' its existence</a>, suggesting a 2025 launch, but the game will instead be released next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. Still, we don't suppose many fans of this franchise will complain. This is the first mainline installment in seven years, after all.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the press release claims it will take the IP to new heights. Harnessing the power of Unreal Engine 5 in addition to proprietary technology, the studio promised players a visually stunning, ultra-realistic aerial thrill ride. It will feature an immersive campaign mode that places players in the role of an ace pilot, embroiled in an emotional tale of identity and duty as they fight for the survival of their homeland. ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE will also feature multiplayer modes that thrust players into high-speed aerial dogfights against friends and foes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The press release notes that the new game continues the legacy of the ACE COMBAT franchise, which has consistently pushed the boundaries of game visuals and action-packed, arcade-inspired gameplay in the flight shooting genre. Players will fly various real-world fighter jets from around the globe in a game characterised by stunning visual detail and effects. They will navigate realistic expanses of clouds, finely rendered terrain and landscapes, and inclement weather. Bandai Namco Aces also teased thrilling cinematics and the option to view them from a first-person perspective, which could potentially enhance the immersion of the story.</p>



<p>The announcement trailer provides a first glimpse of the game's in-depth Campaign Mode, in which players take on the role of an ace pilot in Strangereal, a fictitious war-torn world. The weight of decisions, the pressure of command, and the bonds forged in battle will feel very real. With their nation, the Federation of Central Usea (FCU), occupied and its navy destroyed, players take on the role of the 'Wings of Theve' – a legendary ace whose name is synonymous with Theve, the capital of the FCU, and who is a symbol of hope for every citizen in their homeland. Joined by three new fighter pilots, they embark on a mission to reclaim their homeland and eliminate the threat to their people, carrying the hope of every FCU citizen and taking on the name of their capital city.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, publisher KOEI TECMO and developer Team NINJA announced that a new demo of their upcoming dark samurai action RPG, Nioh 3, will be released on January 29, 2026 on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam). The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous demo</a>, as you might recall, was only available for PS5. Players will be able to sharpen their blades in the new demo in solo mode or in online multiplayer mode with up to three other players. Cross-play is not supported for online multiplayer, according to the press release, and this limitation applies not only to the demo but also to the full game. After completing the demo, fans will be able to carry over their save data to the final game.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at $79.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $119.99. This version includes the Season Pass (also available for separate purchase), as well as the following items: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nioh 3 season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>



<p>The season pass is a set including add-on DLCs. The DLCs include new stories, enemies, yokai, boss characters, and equipment. The aforementioned season pass bonus items will be released on the same date as the base game. Add-on DLC 1 is set to become available by the end of September 2026, and add-on DLC 2 is set to become available by the end of February 2027.</p>



<p>A SteelBook edition is also available to pre-order and includes the base game and two exclusive DLC bonuses. Players can also pre-order a special PlayStation 5 physical edition exclusively through the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/nioh-3-treasure-box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIS America Store</a>. The Nioh 3 TREASURE BOX includes the base game, a Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm Keychain, a Nioh 3 Original Desk Pad, the Official Artbook, and a Nioh 3 Selection Soundtrack CD.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, new exclusive bonuses for players who purchase the game early have been revealed. These players will receive bonus armour sets inspired by protagonists from previous titles: the “Youngblood Armour (Samurai)”, worn by William in Nioh, and the “Lone Wolf’s Armour (Ninja)”, worn by Hide in Nioh 2. These items can be obtained by redeeming the “Hellfrost Armour Set” early purchase bonus in the game. Lastly, a special discount is available on the Steam version of Nioh: Complete Edition, which offers players a 90% discount on the first title in the franchise.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches on February 6, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a>, who recently played the game at a preview event, it feels like the culmination of every previous Team NINJA title. The developers also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured fans that the game won't feature sudden difficulty spikes</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NO LAW, from the Makers of The Ascent, Is a 1st Person Open World Shooter RPG Very Reminiscent of Cyberpunk 2077]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/NeonGiantGames/status/1995417593407050185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> in the past few days, Swedish developer Neon Giant, known for 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-qa-neon-giant-shares-info-on-game-length-crossplay-and-the-games-living-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ascent</a>, has revealed a new game called NO LAW during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. While The Ascent was an isometric twin-stick shooter, though, this upcoming game is a first-person open world shooter roleplaying game that, at least on the surface, is highly reminiscent of CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, players take on the role of Grey Harker, a former soldier who has left his war-torn past behind in favour of a quiet life tending to his plants, until trouble finds him again. When his peace is shattered by violence, Harker must rely on his black-ops instincts and customised equipment to reclaim what was stolen and confront the city that wronged him.</p>



<p>Set against the backdrop of the sprawling port city of Port Desire, carved into the cliffs above a restless sea, the game invites players to explore a neon-sleazy world where regulation is absent. This vibrant metropolis is a hub of import and excess, teeming with colourful characters whose motives are as murky as the smog-filled skyline. Every inch of Port Desire, from the rooftop gardens to the alleys below, is alive and reactive, waiting to be shaped by the player's choices.</p>



<p>Every decision carries weight, according to Neon Giant. Should you help a friend in need or silence an enemy permanently? Should you take the tactical route through the shadows or unleash chaos in open combat? Even in a city without laws, actions have consequences. Each playthrough promises new possibilities, allies and outcomes, making NO LAW an immersive shooter that is as much defined by its story and morality as by its firepower.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NO LAW | The Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD6kFXZlX00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, NO LAW blends visceral first-person combat with deep player agency. Whether the player favours precision, stealth or destruction, their approach will define the in-game experience. Players can master advanced military upgrades, experiment with sci-fi tools and vertical movement, and transform every mission into their own tale of revenge, consequence and survival.</p>



<p>Claës af Burén, Managing Director at Neon Giant, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>NO LAW represents the next step for us as a studio. With The Ascent, we built a strong foundation for how we approach worldbuilding, systems, and storytelling. This new project takes everything we’ve learned and applies it to a completely different kind of experience — one that’s bigger, more reactive, and more personal than anything we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>The game, which will be published by Krafton (the Korean studio acquired Neon Giant in 2022), is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. It can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161710/NO_LAW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, where we found the recommended system requirements.
