			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> launches tomorrow, nearly nine years after the last mainline entry in the franchise, making fans more than eager to get their hands on this new game. Sure, in 2020, there was the Mafia: Definitive Edition remake of the original classic from 2002, but this is a new story, albeit one set in the past.</p>



<p>As the title suggests, Mafia: The Old Country does not take place in America's fictional cities of Lost Heaven, Empire Bay, or New Bordeaux. Instead, it is an origin story of the Sicilian Mafia set on Italy's island very early in the 1900s.</p>



<p>In that light, it is more interesting from a narrative perspective because it shows the true roots of the Mafia. Most American movies have focused on the American side, but the Italian side is where you really understand what it's all about - chiefly, the unyielding adherence to certain values of that world, for better and for worse.</p>



<p>As an Italian myself, I was doubly glad that Hangar 13 chose this setting. Sicily has long been neglected in videogames, and there's hardly a better chance to portray it than in a new Mafia title. To do so, the developers from Hangar 13 (headquartered in Novato, California, but with two offices in the Czech Republic) partnered with local game developer Stormind Games, known for titles like Remothered: Tormented Fathers and Broken Procelain, Batora: Lost Haven, and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>



<p>Through a joint effort documented in a developer diary, Stormind helped Hangar 13 recreate turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sicily, and I'm pleased to report that the results are excellent. In fact, Mafia: The Old Country may very well include the best, most accurate rendition of Sicily ever seen in a game. Everything from the visuals to the dialect and the music is faithfully reproduced. To that end, I would recommend selecting the extremely well-done Sicilian voiceover and add to that whatever subtitles you need to maximize immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Hillside_Church-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That's particularly useful because the game is heavily narrative-driven. All the games in the franchise were, albeit to a different extent. Mafia III, for example, included a proper open world experience, whereas previous entries allowed for open world exploration but only offered minimal side activities. </p>



<p>For this new game, Hangar 13 cut all that. There are no real side activities to be found in Mafia: The Old Country, unless you consider gathering hidden fox-like statuettes or Trinacria symbols such a thing. No, the game is very linear, jumping straight from mission to mission. It can be compared to the Uncharted series in this regard (though the very last one, 2017's The Lost Legacy, actually allowed a decent degree of open ended gameplay that is absent here), with plenty of car chases and setpieces to mark pivotal moments in the story.</p>



<p>The game does occasionally allow you to roam a bit of the countryside of San Celeste (a fictional town located in the vicinity of Mount Etna, which would put it in Eastern Sicily) by car or horse, but there really is nothing to do there except look at the gorgeous environments. I can't help but think that's a bit of a shame - while I understand why the developers decided to go with a full linear design (and a lower price), I believe there's a lot of potential in an open world game set in Sicily, provided that it is filled with enough content to make the exploration worth it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Horse_Riding-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During missions, gameplay consists of a blend of stealth and shooting, just like in the aforementioned Uncharted franchise (platforming, however, is entirely absent). In most missions, you're given the chance to either go in guns blazing or get the drop on the enemies first. Sneaking behind an enemy triggers a little mini-game where you must mash a button repeatedly to fill a bar to knock out the unlucky foe. You can then grab the body and hide it somewhere it won't be seen; otherwise, some other guard could alert the whole map against you. The developers have conveniently (perhaps even too conveniently) placed a great many trunks throughout the levels where bodies of knocked-out foes can be hidden. This is where I noticed something odd: not only could each trunk fit as many as three bodies before becoming unavailable for further disposal, but the previously deposited bodies simply disappeared, with the trunk looking empty each time. A missing detail, albeit a small one, to be sure. </p>



<p>Whenever multiple enemies are looking in the same direction, you can distract one either with a coin toss or by grabbing an empty bottle from the environment and launching it elsewhere. If stealth fails, it will come to shooting. Here, Mafia: The Old Country includes various era-appropriate weapons, from small pistols to sawed-off shotguns, regular shotguns, and long-range guns. These can either be acquired by spending denari (the in-game currency that can be looted off enemies and acquired from small chests after breaking them open with a knife) or by simply looting from the ground weapons used by defeated foes. The shooting component is solid enough, if not quite exceptional. Enemy AI is not the smartest during stealth, but it appears to be more proactive when fights break out, advancing at a steady pace and even flanking the main character's position. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the game lacks a seamless transition from stealth to melee combat, which is a bit jarring. If, for some reason, the enemy you're sneaking on turns early enough, you cannot really switch to fist-fighting like you would in another action/adventure title such as Uncharted. In that case, you'd have to switch to guns instead, as there is no bare-handed melee combat. </p>



<p>The game does include extensive knife fights, but only in one-on-one, cinematic duels against key characters. In these instances, the camera switches to focus solely on the two fighters, not unlike a fighting game. The moveset is a conventional one: the player can select two types of strikes, and also parry and counterattack, and dodge, which is particularly useful against those attacks that cannot be parried (as with most games, they are highlighted in red). They are, effectively, 'boss fights', including two big bars for each contender.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Knife_Fight-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country does feature some character progression, but it's honestly paper-thin. You can equip a few items that provide small boons, such as the chance to dodge a bullet or the ability to carry extra ammunition or bandages. These items can be found scattered throughout the levels, but they do not make much of a difference. Overall, the challenge level is decent when playing on Hard.</p>



<p>By far the best reason to play this game is witnessing the rise and fall of Enzo Favara. The protagonist of Mafia: The Old Country is an orphan youngster who spent long years toiling as an indentured laborer, practically a slave, in the sulfur mines. Following the death of his one and only friend in the mines, Enzo takes his chances and escapes, ending up under the protection of Don Bernardo Torrisi. He begins as the lowliest laborer there, but soon proves his worth in increasingly challenging circumstances. </p>



<p>Without spoiling anything, the plot is pretty much what you can expect from the genre: a talented low-born's tumultuous rise all the way to the top, only to fall again in the end. That said, even without any big twists, the story is told exceptionally well, especially during the cutscenes (the dialogues outside of the cutscenes have worse facial animations). The characters are memorable, if a bit trite, and will stay with you even after reaching the game's ending, which took me twelve hours.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and looks suitably appealing, showing off gorgeous environmental details. Stuttering is thankfully minimal and perhaps that's mostly due to the lack of any open-world elements, which might have complicated matters. The PC version does not feature any ray tracing, offering only standard UE5 options. When it comes to upscalers, all main options are available: Unreal Engine's TSR, NVIDIA DLSS (with Frame Generation selectable in-game and the Multi Frame Generation override available via NVIDIA app), AMD FSR and Intel XeSS (both without frame generation). Even at max settings and 4K resolution, the game only needs about 6.4GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>Finally, the soundtrack is owed a well-earned mention for complementing the mood and ambience in such a striking way.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-is-expected-to-release-by-march-2026-bungie-is-set-to-become-part-of-playstation-studios.1264224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> will launch by March 2026, the end of the current fiscal year, although Sony has yet to commit to this release window.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session which followed the company's latest financial report, where it was also revealed that Sony shipped <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million PlayStation 5 units</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-marathon-is-expected-to-release-before-march-and-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/">VGC</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed that Marathon's sales were factored in the latest forecast, as the company expects the game to be out by March 2026. This, however, isn't a commitment to this release window, as the company believes it can announce a release date by this Fall, as previously confirmed. Though a release date hasn't been set, chances of Marathon being ultimately canceled are slim. The game's issues are being fixed, so the Sony CFO believes the game will indeed launch.</p>



<p>Besides commenting on the Marathon release date, the Sony CFO also commented on the current state of Bungie. Right after the acquisition, the Destiny 2 developer enjoyed a certain degree of independence, but this independence is getting lighter, and the developer is "shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios." Ultimately, the developer's direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">2024's restructuring</a> was one of the steps towards this direction.</p>



<p>Marathon was initially scheduled to release on September 23, but was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a> shortly after its reveal due to the game's bad reception and some controversies, including using <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">art assets from an artist without their permission</a>. With the additional development time, Bungie aims to up the survival game with more engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs with new types of loot and dynamic events, increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling elements, and improve the experience for solo and duo players. Hopefully, the additional development time will be enough to help Bungie give Marathon a distinct identity, which it didn't really show at reveal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been very long, but it definitely looks like it is almost over, as some lucky fans will be able to try out the game developed by Team Cherry in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>As reported on the ResetERA forums, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will be playable at the Nintendo booth at this year's Gamescom, which takes place from August 20 to August 24 in Cologne, Germany. At the booth, players will also be able to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-suggesting-nintendo-switch-2-release-may-be-imminent/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">Borderlands 4</a>, EA Sports FC 2026, and the already released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.</a></p>



<p>With Hollow Knight: Silksong being playable for the first time to the public this month at both the Nintendo and the Xbox booths, and the game said to be available by the time the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds launch worldwide later this year, a release window which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/">Team Cherry also&nbsp;confirmed</a>, there's no doubt a release date announcement is right around the corner. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/">Yesterday</a>, it was suggested by creator Switchforce, who leaked the Nintendo Indie World Direct happening later today before its official announcement, that the game developed by Team Cherry won't be at the show, but there's still the chance the release date will be announced this month, as the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase on August 19 would be the perfect stage for one of the most anticipated game announcements of the year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-reaches-80-3-million-units-shipped.1264134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financial results for Q1 2025</a>, we learned that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 console</a> has now shipped 80.3 million units, breaking the milestone of 80 million. That was thanks to 2.5 million units shipped this quarter, a slight increase compared to the 2.4 million units shipped in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>Overall, it was another excellent quarter for the PlayStation 5, with most indicators trending upward. Full game software sales increased from last year's 53.6 million units to 65.9 million units in the quarter, with a 23% increase. Even first-party game sales went up from 6 million units to 6.9 million units (+15%). The ratio of digital versus physical game sales skewed even more toward digital, which is more great news for Sony, reaching a historic 83%, up from 80% in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>The number of monthly active users (MAUs) on the PlayStation Network also increased, at least compared to Q1 2024, which registered 116 million MAUs, whereas this latest quarter saw 123 million monthly users on the PSN, a 6% increment. Of course, Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 registered higher MAUs (129 and 124 million, respectively), but that is always the case in those quarters.</p>



<p>Overall, sales for the Game and Network Services segment increased by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, the PlayStation 5 is still lagging behind its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, when considering time aligned sales. In June 2018, that console had already shipped 82.3 million units, 2.1 million more than the PS5. </p>



<p>However, the PS5 had other issues to contend with, such as COVID-19, the global chip shortage that lasted from 2020 and 2023, and now increased prices due to the economic environment. All things considered, Sony is probably still happy with how it's going, even if it's selling a little less than the PlayStation 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[007 First Light Is the Fastest IO Interactive Game to Break 500K Wishlists on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-is-the-fastest-io-interactive-game-to-break-500k-wishlists-on-steam.1264125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1953139116930986023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that 007 First Light has already surpassed 500K wishlists on Steam. It is the studio's fastest game to do so, beating their previous HITMAN games, though that's not very surprising when factoring in the power of the 007 IP.</p>



<p>As a reward to the community, IO Interactive revealed that the equippable Savanna Bloom skin will be available at release, and a series of animated wallpapers will be shared shortly. Furthermore, there are other 'missions' to complete if even more fans add the game to their wishlists ahead of the release:</p>



<ul>
<li>Milestone 2: Add flair to your fieldwork with a custom gadget skin, and stream like an agent with a bespoke overlay.</li>



<li>Milestone 3: Go in style with a Deluxe agent skin, plus unlock a developer AMA.</li>



<li>Milestone 4: Confidential. The contents of this final reward are top secret, for nowâ€¦</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//4246066/5768ab8d3f75964ec4c2707eebe79afe53e81d04.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2020 as Project 007. In late 2024, IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it aims to create a 007 gaming franchise, specifically a 'big trilogy'. 007 First Light was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> during Sony's June 2025 State of Play, showing off a cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Players will step into the shoes of a young, reckless, but already resourceful James Bond as he goes through MI6's training program. After a particularly heroic act, the young naval air crewman is offered a spot in the newly revived Double-O program. However, when a mission to stop a rogue agent goes tragically wrong, Bond must team up with his reluctant mentor, Greenway, to expose a deep conspiracy and prevent an impending coup at the heart of the British state.</p>



<p>In short, it is an origin story that includes the events that transformed an audacious young hero into the best MI6 agent. Players will go on missions in breathtaking locations, drive iconic vehicles, and dive into a cinematic adventure in pursuit of a rogue agent whoâ€™s always one step ahead.</p>



<p>Owing to IO Interactive's sandbox approach already seen with HITMAN, players will be able to choose their approach: go silent or go loud. They can fight with fists or firepower, use gadgets to infiltrate, or bluff their way past guards. Moreover, 007 First Light will allow them to replay the missions with additional modifiers.</p>



<p>The game is slated to launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
