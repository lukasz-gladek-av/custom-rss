			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>

<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>
