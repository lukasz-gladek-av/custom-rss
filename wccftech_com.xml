			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing some welcome new features and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>The 0.7.0 version of the emulator, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.7.0">here</a>, introduces, among other things, mouse and keyboard input remapping, shader recompiler fixes, gyro, and acceleration sensor handling fixes, improved compatibility with older CPUs and games powered by the Unity engine, AMD FSR and HDR support, and more. The full changelog over the previous version can be found <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/compare/v.0.6.0...v.0.7.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Even before the launch of version 0.7.0, the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator made some excellent progress in the past few weeks, as highlighted in a new video put together by BrutalSam. While Bloodborne continues to be one of the games the emulator runs best, there's been great progress in the emulation of other PlayStation 4 exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last Guardian, and the original Until Dawn. These games are not exactly in a playable state due to visual glitches and performance issues, but the progress is nonetheless amazing.</p>

			<p>Unfinished builds of multiple unreleased video games, including Riot Games' first fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/">2XKO</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">Killing Floor 3</a> and P<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/">LAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</a> are leaking online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/several-builds-of-unreleased-games-are-leaking-including-riot-games-2xko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, these unfinished builds are getting shared on an undisclosed datamining Discord server, whose members are using them for datamining purposes. As it is often in these cases, however, there's a very high chance some of these games will eventually get leaked in playable form at some point, which will definitely be unfortunate, as their early state could impact the reception the final releases will get once they are officially released. Besides 2XKO, Killing Floor 3 and PLAYERUKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-game-shown-in-debut-gameplay-trailer/">ARC Raiders</a> and an early build of <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/">Delta Force Hawk Ops</a> have also leaked.</p>
<p>While this is setting out to be a rather big leak, it definitely does not compare to the massive Insomniac Games leak from <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-we-are-angry-and-sad-about-the-recent-criminal-cyberattack/">late 2023</a> when all sorts of information got leaked, including information on the then-unannounced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-wip-screenshots-were-leaked/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC port</a>, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ai-upscaling-wolverine/"> PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and a very early build of Marvel's Wolverine. The leak was so severe that a group of users managed to develop an unofficial port of the aforementioned Marvel's Spider-Man 2 before its official release <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">earlier this year.</a></p>
