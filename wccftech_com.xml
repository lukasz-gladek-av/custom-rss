			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/">Last week</a>, <strong>Google</strong> debuted its latest <strong>generative AI</strong> experiment, <strong>Project Genie</strong>. It's a tool capable of generating <strong>interactive three-dimensional environments</strong> made <strong>entirely through generative AI</strong> that you can explore for one solid minute.</p>



<p>All you need to do (after paying the <strong>$250 monthly fee</strong> for <strong>Google's AI Ultra</strong> subscription) is write a prompt to start generating your own game-like worlds, but besides the paywall barrier, there are more than a few limitations to this technology in terms of it becoming the new way to make games.</p>



<p>The fact that it runs at a slide-show speed of 24 frames per second, the fact that you can barely interact with anything in the environment, that the worlds it generates are devoid of any kind of level design, or anything to really do in them, all come to mind before getting to the fact that these worlds only live for one minute at a time.</p>



<p>Still, that didn't stop stock market investors from panicking, causing the shares of major video game industry companies like <strong>Take-Two, Roblox,</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong> to take a nosedive, as if investors suddenly believed the age of game development as we've known it was over, and Project Genie was here to usher in a new age.</p>



<p>Obviously, that won't happen, and even if it does, as <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">SuperJoost Playlist</a> author and co-founder of SuperData Research, <strong>Joost van Dreunen</strong> puts it, "<em>World models like Genie represent meaningful progress in content generation. <strong>But they can't re</strong></em><strong><em>place the creative vision, narrative depth, and intangible elements that make games memorable</em>.<em>"</em></strong></p>



<p>Dreunen, co-founder of one of the foremost video game industry analytics firms, before selling it to NielsonIQ, <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/engine-failure">offered his take on Project Genie</a> after it was revealed and so significantly impacted the stock market for a day.</p>



<p>The top-level takeaway is the aforementioned obvious, that GenAI models like Genie cannot do the job of top-tier game developers. "<em>Creating compelling game worlds is harder than it seems</em>," Dreunen writes, "<em>much like how AI can't simply prompt its way to the next great American novel.</em>"</p>



<p>Even as the technology improves over time, as these GenAI models certainly will, so long as major players like Google and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/openai-strikes-300-billion-project-stargate-deal-with-oracle-to-build-next-generation-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure/">OpenAI</a></strong> continue to invest in them, Dreunen argues that people won't want to play the games they generate, because people want to experience what expert artists and creatives can do - not what a piece of software that's only iterating on the actual creativity of humans can do.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, currently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">players</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">game developers</a> have made it clear that they have no serious love for GenAI tech and games made with GenAI. Dreunen cites the downfall of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-coming-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration/">InZoi</a></strong>, but you need only look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash <strong>Larian Studios</strong> faced</a> after it even flirted with the idea of using GenAI for concept art to see how players feel about the technology.</p>



<p>The only hope that GenAI world models like Project Genie and future iterations that will come after it have, if they have any hope at all, is potentially one day making something that people actually want to experience. Even then, it won't come without actual human input, with creatives using technology like Genie as a tool, if these technologies ever do find a place in game development.</p>



<p>"<em>The horseless carriage phase will pass. When it does, the winners won't be those with the fanciest AI tools. They'll be the ones who used those tools to make something genuinely worth playing</em>."</p>

			<p>South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2018685912973242632?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming open world action/adventure game <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> has been wishlisted by <strong>over two million users across all platforms</strong>. </p>



<p>It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (<strong>the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's</strong>), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets about the game to keep players hooked until the <strong>March 19</strong> launch date. Just yesterday, we reported <span>on an interview in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank">discussed the extensive amount of content players will encounter</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> beyond the main campaign</a> in Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>Now, another interview featuring Powers has appeared on YouTube. This time, the PR Director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dacjty4cYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hosted by Luke Stephens</a>, who at some point said he felt the game leaned more toward Nintendo's <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> than CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> in terms of gameplay dynamics versus narrative. The Pearl Abyss rep countered that <strong>Crimson Desert is actually squarely in the middle between those two open world masterpieces</strong>:</p>



<p><em>If you're going to do it a scale from one side to the other.... There's narrative driven cutscenes in there, too, so I don't want to put it on the far scale there because it's much more in the middle. In The Witcher 3, what drives you through that game is the story. First and foremost, that is a story-driven game. CDPR has created this immersive, amazing, story-driven world. We sit in between those. Is it more one or the other? It's literally right in between because you have that central thread that's pulling you through it, but then there's those narrative-driven like cinematics and everything that are very heavy story. But it's not like The Witcher 3 in the sense that CDPR's game is story, story, story focused.</em></p>



<p>Of course, that's not to say the game's overall quality will be comparable to those two. The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are <strong>two of the highest rated open world games ever made</strong>, only comparable to <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> franchises in this regard. Pearl Abyss would likely be happy just with getting relatively close in terms of critical reception.</p>
