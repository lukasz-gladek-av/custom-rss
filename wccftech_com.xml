			<p>Today, publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> announced that there is a limited-time free <strong>Styx: Blades of Greed demo</strong> available for download on PC via <strong>Steam</strong>. The demo is approximately <strong>17GB</strong> in size and includes <strong>the full first hour</strong> of the game from its beginning. </p>



<p>Players will <strong>infiltrate a massive golem</strong> attacking Styx to destroy it from the inside and also experience Styx's first real mission, <strong>a high-risk zeppelin theft</strong> under the ever-watchful eye of the Inquisition in the first open environment of the game, The Wall. According to the developers, it's a 'focused taste' of the tone, systems, and level of freedom that will be in the full game. There's an extra bit of good news: the demo's save data will carry over to the full game, so you won't have to replay the first hour if you don't want to.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nacon has also <strong>kicked off pre-orders on all platforms</strong> (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> with Pre-order Bonus includes the base game and the Master of Shadows Skin from the first installment and is available for purchase at a price of <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> <strong>on consoles</strong>, and <strong>€39.99</strong>, <strong>$39.99</strong>, and <strong>£34.99</strong> <strong>on PC</strong> via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The pricier <strong>Quartz Edition</strong>, on the other hand, includes the base game, two days of early access, the Greedy and Legacy skin packs for Styx and his weapons, a Starter Pack with two talent points and some crafting resources, and 5 additional taunts to lure enemies. The Master of Shadows Skin pre-order bonus is also included. If you want the Quartz Edition for Styx: Blades of Greed, it'll set you back <strong>€59.99</strong>, <strong>$59.99</strong>, and <strong>£54.99</strong> on consoles and <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> on PC via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Finally, there's a new <strong>Styx: Master of Stealth Collection bundle</strong> that brings together the whole stealth series: 2014's <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong>, 2017's <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong>, and the new Styx: Blades of Greed in its Quartz Edition. This is available for <strong>€69.99</strong>, <strong>$69.99</strong>, and <strong>£64.99</strong> on consoles, and is also available on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65163/Styx_Master_of_Stealth_Collection__Prepurchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, albeit at a higher price of <strong>€85.50</strong>.</p>



<p>Our own Francesco De Meo played the demo in advance as part of a press event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed cautious optimism</a>:</p>



<p><em>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options.</em></p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed launches on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

			<p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">New York Times</a> on Monday revealed that <strong>Meta</strong> would be <strong>laying off 10% of its Reality Labs</strong> division, the branch of its business under which it works on products like the Metaverse, and also houses its internal VR teams under <strong>Oculus Studios</strong>, including <strong>Deadpool VR</strong> developer <strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asgards-wrath-ii-hands-on-impressions-vrs-breakout-untethered-rpg/">Asgard's Wrath 2</a></strong> developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquired-sanzaru-games-asgards-wrath-for-its-oculus-studios/">Sanzaru Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, as developers began sharing the news that they had been impacted by the cuts, we learned that at least two whole studios, the aforementioned Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games, <strong>would be shut down</strong>, with the entirety of their teams laid off.</p>



<p>The first signal came from <strong>Andy Gentile</strong>, a designer at Twisted Pixel, who shared on his <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">X (formerly Twitter) account</a> that not only had he been laid off, but the entire studio, along with Sanzaru Games, had been shut down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear how many people have been impacted by the cuts, but more developers have come forward to confirm the news of the two studios shutting down, including a senior level designer at Sanzaru, Ray West, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on his personal LinkedIn page</a>, "<em>Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru.</em> <em>It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know everyone there.</em>"</p>



<p>Twisted Pixel is known for titles like Deadpool VR, 'Splosion Man, and Path of the Warrior, while Sanzaru was highly regarded for its Asgard's Wrath titles, the second of which is commonly known as one of the best VR titles to release in recent years. </p>



<p>Sanzaru also has a place in the hearts of many longtime PlayStation fans, as it was also the team that ported the first three Sly Cooper games to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and even developed the fourth entry in the franchise, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. Sanzaru was also responsible for ports of the God of War Collection and Secret Agent Clank.</p>



<p>Both studios were founded in 2006, which means that Meta is shuttering them just as they were set to hit their 20th anniversaries. A milestone that not many studios get to hit anymore in today's unstable video game industry. It's altogether an unfortunate start to 2026, and a sign that the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry for the last few years aren't going away anytime soon.</p>
