			<p>Warhorse Studios has <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> the imminent launch of official mod support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The developer also revealed that it will be implemented through Steamworks rather than other options like Mod.io. As such, you should be able to download mods directly through Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>This will, of course, be in addition to all the regular mods that have been released and will continue to be released via platforms like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods?BH=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> some of the convenience mods last week, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-4k-skins-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skin mod</a>, but there's a lot more you can find there. There are 412 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods on Nexus, 291 of which were released in the last seven days. With the official mod integration, the community will have even greater incentives to continue improving, tweaking, and enhancing the game. Presumably, official mod tools will be released, too, although that was not explicitly confirmed at this point.</p>
<p>Warhorse's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was a resounding success on all accounts. Commercially, it has already recouped costs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold over a million units</a>. Critically, it stands at 88 average score on Metacritic. This includes our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 score from Chris Wray</a>:</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>The release of official mod support won't be the end of Warhorse's work for this game. The Czech studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its 2025 roadmap, announcing a free update for Spring (bringing barber, horse racing, and Hardcore mode), the Brushes With Death DLC for Summer, the Legacy of the Forge DLC for Autumn, and the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC for Winter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-pc-technical-report-%E2%80%93-solid-work-from-obsidian-4k-200fps-with-dlaa-and-max-settings.1109439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-pc-technical-report-solid-work-from-obsidian-4k200fps-with-dlaa-and-max-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed may be officially slated for February 18, but owners of the Premium Edition can already play it. As such, a technical report is in order.</p>
<p>I played the game extensively pre-release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the review</a> and immediately noticed the game's solid performance across the board. As far as Unreal Engine 5 games go, this may be one of the smoothest I've played to date.</p>
<p>Sure, it isn't the most taxing. It is not, after all, an open world title, although its zones are fairly large. It also doesn't path tracing like Black Myth: Wukong, although its ray traced reflections look great on water surfaces, and the ray traced lighting and shadows definitely augment the visuals. More importantly, the stuttering is minimal, especially when you add a frame rate cap. That's always a worry for Unreal Engine games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Avowed-Shaders-Generation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Obsidian has adopted the best practice of running shader generation when loading the game. It will take a while the first time, even with a high-end NVMe SSD like WD Black's SN850X. However, you'll only need to do it again after a driver update, otherwise the game will check them quickly and then load the main menu. The tradeoff is definitely advantageous compared to having the initial experience marred by stuttering.</p>
<p>During the review period, we didn't have access to NVIDIA DLSS 4 or Multi Frame Generation, as the game wasn't listed as supported on the NVIDIA app for the Override feature. Still, I ended up using the DLSS Swapper tool because subtitles were affected by ghosting. By default, Avowed uses a fairly old (3.5.10.0) version of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Updating to DLSS 4 easily fixed the problem, though Multi Frame Generation and DLAA were still unavailable.</p>
<p>That changed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-572-42-is-optimized-for-avowed-indiana-jones-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's GeForce Game Ready driver</a>. You can now select the latest DLSS 4 transformer model for Super Resolution, the improved AI-based Frame Generation model, as well as force Multi Frame Generation and DLAA through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed PC 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen, GeForce RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRv4UwAC4-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features no built-in benchmark, so I had to come up with a custom solution. I decided to record performance with NVIDIA FrameView while roaming through Paradis, by far the largest city in Avowed with the most amount of NPCs. Of course, I used 4K resolution, and every setting was turned to the max (labeled Epic, as in most Unreal Engine games):</p>
<ul>
<li>View Distance</li>
<li>Shadow Quality</li>
<li>Texture Quality</li>
<li>Shading Quality</li>
<li>Effects Quality</li>
<li>Foliage Quality</li>
<li>Post-Processing Quality</li>
<li>Reflection Quality</li>
<li>Global Illumination Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz G.SKILL Trident Z5</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition</li>
</ul>

</figure>


<p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, I had enough headway to run DLAA at 200 average frames per second. Dropping to DLSS Quality provided a 30% boost to the average frame rate, which averaged 260FPS when upscaling from 1440p to 4K. However, the stuttering time increased from 7.30% to 13.29%, likely because of the larger difference between the maximum and minimum frame rates. Indeed, when looking at the 0.1% Low, DLAA and DLSS Quality are nearly identical (118 and 123 FPS, respectively). On the flip side, latency is lower when using DLSS Quality, though the difference is just over 8 ms (40.9 ms with DLSS Quality, 49.1 ms with DLAA).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that the frame rate variance would be far lower when capping the frame rate, which you should absolutely do when actually playing the game. Indeed, during the review period, I capped the frame rate with the in-game slider to 120FPS and had a very smooth experience even without Multi Frame Generation.</p>

<p>Graphically, Avowed received a lot of criticism before its launch. However, the final version is nothing to complain about. In fact, it is often rather beautiful, thanks to the striking biomes and the highly detailed characters and armors. Sure, facial animations may not always be great, but only a handful of studios have really mastered that part of character rendering. As you can see above, the ray traced reflections are very pretty, though it's usually Lumen's lighting that elevates the visuals.</p>
<p>However, I do have to criticize Obsidian for its lack of native High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support. In 2025, this is nearly inexcusable, especially when the Xbox version supports not only HDR10 but Dolby Vision, too.</p>
<p>I had to resort to the Unreal Engine 5 HDR workaround <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Unreal_Engine_5#High_dynamic_range_.28HDR.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on PC Gaming Wiki</a> to enable HDR. Basically, you need to add the following variables to the GameUserSettings.ini file:</p>
<p><em>[SystemSettings]</em><br>
<em>r.AllowHDR=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.EnableHDROutput=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice=5</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut=2</em></p>
<p>It's not nearly the same as having it natively supported and optimized, though. Hopefully, a patch can resolve this.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Avowed supports the DualSense Edge controller right away despite not having any PlayStation 5 version announced. Granted, you'll have the wrong icons and no Adaptive Triggers or Haptic Feedback, but regular rumble works just fine. Lastly, I had good results with my Dolby Atmos setup when upmixing via the Dolby Access app, which I take as a sign of great surround sound implementation. The game also features sliders for Field of View (from 90 to 105) and for motion blur.</p>
<p>When scrolling Avowed's credits, the game lists many supporting studios, including the Xbox Games Technology Group, which was created in 2023 inside The Coalition. The studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-coalition-shows-stunning-ue5-demo-running-on-xbox-series-x-nanite-allows-100x-detail-lumen-is-a-total-game-changer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the foremost Unreal Engine experts</a>, and I have little doubt that they were instrumental in helping Obsidian achieve their objectives with their game. In this regard, if nothing else, having the support of Xbox's teams has definitely leveled up the experience compared to The Outer Worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-sold-40000/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Early Nintendo Switch 2 units are reportedly selling on the black market in China for an exorbitant amount of money.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the new Nintendo system and provided the first accurate look at its design before the official reveal last month shared a screenshot featuring a conversation with a black market seller saying that the system, complete with dock and Joy-Con controllers, costs 290,000 RMB, around $39,780. While no regular user would spend so much money to get the console, the Xiahongshu forums user is selling the opportunity to manufacturers to test accessories on a real unit, so they have something going on to earn back the money spent.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ip50jr/chinese_cad_model_leaker_shows_a_screenshot_of/">Chinese CAD model leaker shows a screenshot of his DMs with a black market seller, saying the prices for the Switch 2 dock, joycons, and tablet will cost him $39,780</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">u/Icy-ConcentrationC</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While there's no way to really know if the Xiahongshu forums user really has an actual Nintendo Switch 2, it likely won't take long to learn if it is true, considering the user did share the CAD model online after acquiring it and how people are hungering to learn more about the system ahead of the dedicated Nintendo Direct that will air on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch sometime this year. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but considering the preview events around the world will be hosted until late May, a release in the second half of the year is to be expected.</p>

			<p>Despite not having been announced yet, the Final Fantasy IX remake remains in active development alongside another unannounced series remaster, but both may not be released soon, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known and reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake of the ninth entry in the series by Square Enix, saying that it remains in active development alongside another rumored remaster, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-playtested/">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. Unfortunately, it looks like it may be a while until we see how Zidane's adventure will get updated for modern gaming hardware, as the game isn't expected to be released in 2025, although, the insider highlighted, the fact that nothing has been heard about it doesn't mean that it won't release for sure before the end of the year. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster also isn't expected to release this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Both remain in active development. FFIXR isn't expected to see release in 2025. Maybe we'll see it launch in 2026.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just because I haven't heard it... doesn't mean it's not coming this year, to be clear. I simply don't have a timeline of release on the game at the moment.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889021467490136206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not that I've heard.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889020257450209727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake, as mentioned above, has yet to be officially announced and was originally revealed via a huge GeForce Now leak a few years back. While multiple insiders have provided different details on the game, all have suggested that the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original and will have a more modest budget than the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.</a> Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida also commented on a potential remake last year, acknowledging the demand and highlighting how it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-multiple-games/">difficult to remake the original with a single game</a>, although it's difficult to imagine Square Enix committing to another long undertaking with multiple games to remake a title that, while beloved by many, it's not as popular as the seventh entry in the series.</p>

			<p>Today, Eclipse Glow Games has shared an extended gameplay video of its exciting newly announced action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation. The video, published on IGN's YouTube channel, is embedded below. In the footage, we get to see a bit of exploration, some standard fighting, and a boss fight against the game's version of Mordred Pendragon.</p>
<p>It's clearly a work-in-progress build, but it shows a lot of promise, confirming what we already saw at Gamescom 2024 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in this article</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, players will explore an alternate version of London that lies in ruins, following a surprise invasion from another realm. They'll step into this world as Gwendolyn, supposedly the city's last surviving inhabitant, as she navigates otherworldly foes and gains awesome powers of her own.</p>
<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn will be able to summon over ten legendary knights (picking two at a time). They were inspired by Arthurian myths, bringing unique skills and abilities that will allow players to craft their own fighting playstyles and combos. Such powers will be needed to face the gigantic knights that now roam ruined London. Players will get not only to fight them but also scale them, as they are practically levels of their own.</p>
<p>In this game, London isn't just devastated, it's also transformed. But there's also the fantasy realm of Avalon, where the supernatural is even more prevalent between ancient magic and legendary creatures. Throughout the journey, Gwendolyn will have to save her family, the city, and even reality itself.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC and consoles with Unreal Engine 5, and the studio has already confirmed PS5 Pro support with ray tracing and 60FPS mode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Tides of Annihilation, such as its planned length, the current boss target, and the tentative launch window, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our interview with Eclipse Glow Games from Gamescom 2024</a>.</p>

			<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot has dominated DICE Awards 2025 with five award wins:&nbsp;Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Family Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, as well as the most coveted one, Game Of The Year.</p>
<p>It's another big victory for the platform game, which had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received the Game of the Year prize at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards</a> ceremony in December and <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-sweeps-at-new-york-game-awards-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the New York Game Awards</a> last month. So far, when taking in most outlets and organizations, Astro Bot has put itself far ahead of any other game released in 2024 when it comes to GOTY awards. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here on Wccftech</a>, though, it only won the genre-specific award, whereas the overall Game of the Year went elsewhere.</p>
<p>On another note, the developers have just started releasing free new Astro Bot content. The Tick-Tock Shock level is already out, while four more levels will be rolled out according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>Team Asobi also confirmed that a PS5 Pro update for Astro Bot is on the way, allowing players to enjoy the game at 4K@60 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot Add-On - Tick-Tock Shock | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iI4iROxxkHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for the rest of the DICE Awards 2025 winners, Helldivers 2 won four prizes: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design, Action Game of the Year, and Online Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which our staff voted as Wccftech's Game of the Year, won in the Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year categories.</p>
<p>Balatro developer LocalThunk also won three awards: Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game, and Mobile Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong prevailed in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category, while Metaphor: Refantazio won RPG of the Year.</p>
<p>For the individual award, Don Jones received the Lifetime Achievement Award, while former Insomniac founder and CEO Ted Price (who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the cancellation of a Resistance 4 project) was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
