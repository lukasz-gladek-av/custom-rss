			<p>2024's <strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> was one of the best games to release that year, despite it being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/">VR Meta Quest 3 exclusive and not arriving until December</a>. A sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">accidentally confirmed by one of its voice actors, <strong>Mark Rolston</strong></a>, who was set to play Commissioner Gordon in the coming sequel. But a new report from <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-canceled-as-camouflaj-sees-significant-layoffs/">UploadVR</a> reveals that <strong>Meta's</strong> recent 10% layoff to its Reality Labs division hit developer <strong>Camouflaj</strong> with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs, cancelling the sequel, and <strong>marking the end of Camouflaj developing VR games entirely</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong>Sanzaru Games</strong> were both shuttered by Meta</a> as part of the recent layoffs, which saw <strong>1,000</strong> people get laid off across the Reality Labs branch of Meta. While Camouflaj was one of the few that didn't get entirely shut down, according to the report, the studio "<em>has seen significant layoffs, and will no longer be developing VR games</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that Sanzaru Games was working on the Arkham Shadow sequel alongside Camouflaj, though that work ended once Sanzaru was shuttered, which also contributed to the sequel project getting cancelled. </p>



<p>With the teams behind two of the best VR games to release in recent years either shut down or pushed out of making VR games entirely, it's a clear sign from Meta that it is no longer invested in making VR games. It's also a sign of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones">Meta stepping away from its Metaverse focus</a> and instead investing in AI.</p>



<p>VR hasn't grown to be the next frontier of gaming in the way that many touted it would for years, as it remains a niche part of tech and the gaming industry, but it's still upsetting to see the teams that were making genuine strides in pushing the medium forward have been pushed out of it. Sanzaru Games' Asgard's Wrath 2 was regarded as one of the best VR games ever made when it arrived in 2023. Arkham Shadow was a new step forward for what combat could look like in VR.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this isn't the end for Camouflaj entirely, and we still see them move on to make their own games, rather than becoming a support studio for the few remaining teams under Meta's Reality Labs division still making VR games.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong> developer <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> will reveal the next <strong>Life is Strange</strong> game next week on <strong>January 20, 2026,</strong> in a live stream that will kick off at <strong>10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</strong></p>



<p>The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists <strong>Max Caulfield </strong>and <strong>Chloe Price</strong>, who walk across the frame in the teaser.</p>

<p>2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched</a> - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning.</p>



<p>This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans. In the meantime, if you're looking for more Life is Strange, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/">Amazon has greenlit a TV series adaptation of the franchise led by Kaos writer <strong>Charlie Covell</strong></a>. </p>
