			<p>New leaks that emerged online over the weekend have provided another look at the Nintendo Switch 2 supposed design, the system's ports, and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1heyizw/more_photos_of_the_switch_2/?share_id=9la12PrZ5fFQxo6Zaow3S&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, another Chinese manufacturer shared images of their upcoming accessories, providing a look not only at the supposed design of the system but also at details like the back stand, Joy-Con controller buttons, the top of the system, and more. While we have seen the system's design multiple times already, these images help us get a better idea of how the Nintendo Switch 2 will look, although we still do not know if this will indeed be the console's final design.</p>
<p>Another detailed look at the Nintendo Switch 2 ports also arrived during the weekend, thanks to the Chinese leaker who previously created <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">CAD models</a> of the system based on a prototype used by an accessories manufacturer, providing the first supposed look at the console. Reddit user Fidler_2k also shared the images again with details on what each port showed on the system's top and bottom could be for, and you can find them on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1heg76q/xiaohongshu_the_one_who_originally_leaked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">The number of leaks</a> that have been circulating online in the past few days is a very good indication of how players are excited about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like they aren't the only ones. According to Paul Gate, many of those who attended this year's The Game Awards after-party were very positive about the system, and some instances of confirmed dedicated support were also promising to hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My take away from The Game Awards after party regarding the successor to Nintendo Switch was VERY positive.</p>
<p>Many people that I spoke to were excited to see the system, hyped over what Nintendo’s games were going to look like next generation, or ready to play more modern…</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-bandai-namco-best-selling/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is doing quite well on the market, so much so that it is reportedly one of Bandai Namco's best-selling games ever.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-games-in-bandai-namco-history-a-nice-surprise-in-a-year-thats-been-kind-of-rough-overall-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Circana's executive director and games analyst Matt Piscatella revealed his surprise at how well the game is selling, highlighting how it has become not only the best-selling Dragon Ball game to date but also one of the best-selling Bandai Namco games ever. <em>"One heck of a nice surprise in a year that's been kind of rough overall,"</em> according to the analyst.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success on the market is wholly deserved, in my opinion. The game is not only a massive love letter to the franchise and an incredible tribute to the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly passed away this year, but also a very fun game to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-so-big-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-%E2%80%98so-big%E2%80%99-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven.1062261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-so-big-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios prepared a nifty Christmas video for its large community of fans. First and foremost, greetings from every office worldwide are included: Kuala Lumpur, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warsaw</a>, Ghent (the headquarters), Barcelona, Guildford, Dublin, and Quebec.</p>
<p>Then, the focus returns to Senior Communications Developer Aoife Wilson, who claims she's got one more thing. It's a big gift with a 'Larian's Next Game' tag on it. She's got just enough time to shake it once before Larian CEO Swen Vincke jokingly tackles her off-screen, though. Vincke said:</p>
<p><em>Oh no, you don't! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry, sorry about that. No, this thing, it needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished, it's going to be so big! For the time being you're going to have to wait.</em></p>
<p>And then he proceeds to kick the package far away. I have to say, I certainly wasn't expecting them to start teasing the game so soon. After all, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Baldur's Gate 3 in August 2023, and we only <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> they wouldn't do DLCs or a sequel in March.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vincke himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not long ago that the next title could come as late as 2029. Sure, he also later added that it was kind of a throwaway line, and he did not want Larian to be beholden to a date. However, a lot of time is clearly needed. After all, Baldur's Gate 3 was revealed ahead of E3 2019 and only launched out of early access more than four years later. From the sound of it, this one will be similarly big, and triple-A development times are only increasing with each new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Larian Christmas Gift" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4AJ7gCqrvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps this very early tease is an indirect confirmation that the studio's next project will also be released on early access. While this won't make its full launch come any quicker (in fact, the opposite might be true), it would put an early version of it in the hands of the players a lot sooner, probably in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the studio's fans must be patient. In the meantime, there's their <a href="https://advent.larian.com/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent Calendar</a> Web game to go through. Speaking of actual videogames, Larian has at least one major Baldur's Gate 3 update <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for next year. It will add cross-play for cooperative multiplayer, a built-in Photo Mode, and twelve new subclasses to the award-winning cRPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-rumored-to-be-coming-to-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new rumor, LEGO Horizon Adventures might be coming to Xbox after all. As you might remember, Microsoft's console was the only one left out of the fun, with the game launching right away on PC, Nintendo Switch, and, obviously, PlayStation. Ahead of the game's launch, Guerrilla Games (which partnered with Studio Gobo to make the spin-off) <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a rather unconvincing explanation for the absence:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Just Play It, though, which doesn't really have a track record when it comes to these leaks. Take it with a big grain of salt, but they're saying the reason is LEGO Horizon Adventures only had a modest commercial performance. They also provide a potential release window for the Xbox version: early 2025.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures attempted to retell Aloy's first adventure in a manner more befitting for younger audiences. However, the game wasn't quite as successful as the original. It got 6.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, a much lower score than Horizon Zero Dawn. Reviewer Nathan Birch shared these final thoughts about the game:</p>
<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really want more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</em></p>
