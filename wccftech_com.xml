			<p>It had been six months since Pascal Gilcher, also known as Marty McFly, had released an update for his popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-shader-adds-image-based-lighting-extended-ray-length-multiplier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTGI ReShade shader</a>.&nbsp;However, a new version just became available to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> subscribers, and it's a big one.</p>
<p>The modder tried to implement the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> algorithm in his shader, but encountered several limitations, like chroma noise (because reservoir sampling can only hold light from a single direction), sample correlation that breaks denoiser variance estimation, and white noise output. Eventually, Gilcher decided to design his own sampling algorithm, which he reckons vastly outperforms ReSTIR GI in terms of quality.&nbsp;The RTGI shader has also received significant improvements to its reflections, which now trace pixel-perfect paths using HiZ Min-Max Tracing.</p>
<p>The modder also shared future plans to split RTGI's diffuse and specular components into separate shaders to manage them more easily.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marty's Mods | Update June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PImgAUIoyZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There were also improvements to other Gilcher's shaders, such as MXAO, which saw the fixing of the low-radius halos that manifested around objects, and especially Launchpad, whose optical flow is used by several other shaders. This new version of Launchpad introduces an innovative gradient descent-based algorithm that can handle subpixel shifts more effectively than traditional grid-based search methods.</p>
<p>Users can now choose from two general-purpose gradient descent optimizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton: Converges quickly, making it more suitable for lower-quality settings.</li>
<li>SophiaG: Converges more slowly, but finds better minima, making it a good fit for high-quality settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, Gilcher has released a brand new shader: path traced volumetric fog. It was originally built as a ground truth reference for a real-time effect, but the modder ultimately enjoyed so much that the full path-traced version is now available in beta testing, although it's meant to be used for screenshots only. Check out the example below, which was captured in God of War.</p>

<figure><figcaption>After</figcaption></figure>
<p>The path traced volumetric fog shader is currently only available at the most expensive Patreon tier, 'Photon Mappers', which costs $20 monthly.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-will-introduce-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-amd-fsr-4-support-on-pc-and-more.1229862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides new content, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 is introducing some new features on PC, the full update notes confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">release date</a> and most significant additions, which include returning monsters Lagiacrus and Seregios, the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Update 2 full notes</a> have gone live, confirming it will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4 support on PC. Multi Frame Generation support is also being added by the update, featuring an Auto option that will dynamically turn frame generation on and off depending on the load. The upscaling and frame generation options will also be separated once the title update goes live, allowing users, for example, to use NVIDIA DLSS for upscaling and AMD FSR frame generation together, or any other combination. Rounding up the PC-specific additions are a warning dialogue that warns the user they are using out-of-date GPU drivers, new customizable keyboard configuration controls, and the option of copying the Lobby ID/ Hunter ID via the Start Menu and the Squad ID via the Squad Menu. Unfortunately, the Title Update 2 notes make no mention of performance or optimization improvements, so most users will still have to rely on Frame Generation to hit acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2, which launches next week on June 30, introduces Lagiacrus and Seregios, a Layered Weapons system, and many other features. Next month, hunters will also be able to take on Arch-tempered Uth Duna and participate in a Fender Special Collaboration event in August. The following Title Update, which has yet to be detailed, will launch in September.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 may be a sequel, but it's definitely doing some things differently than its predecessor. One of those things is the ability for players to 'respec', that is to say, to change their allocation of perks, traits, and whatnot. The first game supported that, but the new game director Brandon Adler, who did not work on the original The Outer Worlds (but has credits in Obsidian RPGs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and Avowed), has a different view on the matter. Speaking to RPG Site, he <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>We don't allow respec. Lots of people love respec… that is definitely one way you can go about things. I personally want the player to understand their choices are permanent – they matter – and then they think more about their choices. There's a lot of times where you'll see games where they allow infinite respec, and at that point I'm not really role-playing a character, because I'm jumping between -- well my guy is a really great assassin that snipes from long range, and then oh, y'know, now I'm going to be a speech person, then respec again.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, it's not wrong that people like to play like that. But I just like to make sure... Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely an interesting view. I can see where he's coming from, although others will be disappointed by the lack of flexibility when building their new character. However, you are still allowed a bit of experimentation in the beginning, as you can still respect while in the tutorial area.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X and will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1938250909865410867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, had surpassed one million players. At the same time, the Finnish developer acknowledged that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-gets-update-1-2-as-remedy-promises-lots-more-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of work to do</a> to improve the game:</p>
<p><em>As of last night, we have surpassed 1 million players in FBC: Firebreak. This is a significant milestone, so thank you for playing from all of us at Remedy. We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super-motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the game may have reached one million players, but that's not saying too much since it has been available on the two primary subscription services, Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Game Pass, since day one.</p>
<p>On Steam, the FBC: Firebreak peaked at 1,992 players ten days ago, but it's been getting lower and lower. Yesterday, the daily peak was 169 players. At the time of writing, there are 78 players playing the game via Valve's platform. User reviews are 'Mixed', too, with just 67% leaving a positive review.</p>
<p>Now, it is definitely a little early to sound the requiem for the game. We've seen several online games starting badly and managing to claw back their way to a decent, active user base. The reverse is also true, with some games starting off strong and then dying down like a flame.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any live service game lives or dies depending on the developer's ability to gather feedback, analyze it, and implement it properly. We'll see in the next few months how well Remedy fares in this regard, where so many developers have stumbled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can read our full review of FBC: Firebreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, penned by Francesco De Meo.</p>

			<p>Swedish game developer Fatshark <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-new-arbites-class-via-dlc-and-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first paid DLC for Warhammer 40K Darktide earlier this week, adding the Adeptus Arbites class. Today, the studio has proudly shared that the launch has been successful. Martin Wahlund, CEO and Co-Founder of Fatshark, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We more than doubled our estimated player goals on launch day alone. Thank you for making this launch one to remember!</em></p>
<p>The team also shared some fun stats. The Cyber-Mastiff companion has been petted more than 459,760 times as a reward for being a very good boy. Users have already killed 553,082,097 enemies with an Adeptus Arbites character. Their most used melee weapon so far is the Mk III Branx Pattern Arbites Shock Maul, used 969,008 times, while the most used ranged weapon is the Mk III Executioner Pattern Arbites Shotgun, used 1,157,103 times. The players' favorite ability is Break The Line, which was activated 715,525 times.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Darktide players can purchase the Arbites DLC for $11.99, although there's also a Deluxe Edition available at $18.99. This version includes a unique class outfit, a unique companion outfit, a portrait frame (this one can be equipped by characters of all classes), and four weapon skins.</p>
<p>Alongside the DLC, Fatshark also released a free update that introduced a more structured narrative path to ease new players into the game. The mission board system was revamped, too, increasing the number of mission options for all characters. The patch also increased the maximum number of Operatives to eight, as was the maximum number of weapon loadouts. Fatshark also added around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, Darktide was not the only Warhammer 40K game to launch new content focused on the Adeptus Arbites. Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG also just released the Lex Imperialis expansion, introducing this very class of enforcers of the Emperor's justice, including a new companion, Solomorne Anthar.</p>
