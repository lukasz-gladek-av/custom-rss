			<p>Today, Pearl Abyss announced that Black Desert console will be updated with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously confirmed</a> native versions for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles on June 26. The community had been waiting a long time; it has been well over four years since those consoles launched, after all. The caveat is that the game won't be playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One anymore after that date.</p>
<p>The General Manager <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlGGwrWCBU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>Black Desert console was first introduced in 2019 with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and this month <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-now-live-in-black-desert-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the fifth anniversary of crossplay</a>. In our previous commentary video, we've mentioned that we are preparing for a native gen port with the goal of releasing an update in the first half of this year. We'd like to share that platform certification for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox series versions is progressing as planned. While there is a possibility of some schedule changes depending on the certification status, if all processes are completed smoothly, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be available on June 26.</em></p>
<p><em>As mentioned previously, the update will be provided at no additional cost while we are excited to bring this update to our community. Following the porting update, Black Desert console will be transitioning to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service. Consequently, gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available. Rest assured your game data will be safely stored your account information and all entitlements to Black Desert will be fully accessible when you're ready to transition to the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series version of your console.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you. However, as we mentioned in </em><em>our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly </em><em>difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly. We kindly ask for your understanding and </em><em>offer our sincerest apologies for this decision that is made with the long-term growth of Black Desert console in mind. </em></p>
<p><em>We believe that the transition to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service will be an important first step in providing a better gaming environment from Black Desert console. </em><em>Performance improvements involve many different factors, so it might be difficult to notice immediate changes in old areas but we will continue working to address the limitations experienced on the older generation consoles. Furthermore, we are planning updates for</em><br>
<em>various content that you have all been waiting for.</em></p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced today that The Legend of Zelda live-action movie will be released in theaters on March 26, 2027, roughly two years from today. The news was posted on Nintendo Today, the brand new app that was unveiled yesterday during the Nintendo Direct. According to the Big N, this smart device app is a daily calendar featuring the latest news, videos, and comics of Nintendo games and characters from select franchises. Nintendo Today is available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znsa&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>. Clearly, the delivery of such big news through the app is a way to emphasize its importance in Nintendo communications going forward.</p>
<p>The Zelda live action movie was <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> on November 8, 2023. Back then, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto said in a brief message to fans:</p>
<p><em>This is Miyamoto. I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega-hit films. I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.</em></p>
<p>Wes Ball, known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, will direct the film. Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX—The Return of the Jedi, will write the script. The next step will obviously be to find the actors forming the cast. Fans are already wondering who will be cast in the key roles of Link and Zelda herself. Who would you like to see playing these hugely beloved characters? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 RTX can be easily fixed to look much closer to the original game in terms of ambiance and atmosphere with some choice tweaks showcased in a recent video.</p>
<p>The video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2kliksphilip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2kliksphilip</a> highlights how volumetrics and light bounce impact the ambiance in the currently available demo of the RTX Remix project the most. The first is easily fixed by reducing the Max Accumulation Distance, which makes volumetrics update much faster once a light source has been covered, and the Froxel Max Distance settings, which, reduced to 0, completely eliminates fog and similar effects.</p>
<p>The other setting that was changed to make Half-Life 2 RTX look much closer to the original is the Max Expected Average Radiance, which was set to 0 to limit how much lighting bounces around. This creates a much darker atmosphere that's more in line with the limited light bounce the Source 1 engine was capable of.&nbsp; The amazing adjustability of RTX Remix has also allowed the modder to show how Ravenholm would look during the early morning by setting a negative value to fog distance.</p>

<p>Besides being an excellent showcase of how RTX Remix can significantly upgrade older games' visuals, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is also an excellent showcase of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-showcase-sampler-feedback-vram/">Sampler Feedback technology</a>, which can be used to significantly lower VRAM usage, which can be a game-changer in the future for those playing games on GPUs with low VRAM.
