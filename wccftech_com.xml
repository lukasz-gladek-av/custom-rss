			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>

<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA and Respawn </a>have just debuted a new gameplay trailer for the latest season for Apex Legends, which is up to its 26th season now since the free-to-play movement-focused battle royale launched in 2019. Season 26: Showdown will arrive on all platforms on August 5, 2025, bringing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-game-updates">some significant changes</a> to the gameplay, including a new permanent mode, Wildcard.</p>



<p>Wildcard is a new mode that really lets players break the tried-and-true systems of Apex Legends. Gone are any cares towards tactical synergies between Legends. You can stack your whole team with the same legend if you want in Wildcard, as you zip and fly around the altered version of Kings Canyon which has been tuned with more ziplines, more launch pads, and every player gets a second chance without having to be revived, so long as you die before the final ring. </p>



<p>Looting has also been simplified and streamlined in this mode to make everything as action-packed as possible. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other changes beyond the addition of Wildcard as a new permanent mode include the introduction of Elite weapons, the first of which is the RE-45. Two Legends, Caustic and Bangalore, are getting significant buffs this season. Amps are being introduced as new passive upgrades players can pick up in ranked and unranked matches. Hop-ups will be locked to weapons now instead of being pick-ups on the ground for players to loot. The reign of the Jumpmaster has ended, as ranked matches will now feature pre-assigned drop zones instead, and the E-District map is getting a switch to a daytime setting.</p>



<p>These are also just the highlights regarding the big changes, as the full details will be unveiled with the full patch notes that will arrive a day before Season 26 goes live, on August 4, 2025.</p>
