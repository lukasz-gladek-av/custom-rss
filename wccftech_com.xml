			<p>If you've been getting stuck into the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest game</a> from MachineGames, you'll know that you're stepping into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">role of Indiana Jones</a>. In this game, you'll get to hunt for relics, solve puzzles, and, of course, fight off many villains. If you've been doing your exploring correctly, you will have come across some Skill Books in the game. Don't panic if you don't know what they're for just yet, as this guide will explain everything you need to know about the Skill Books and how to use them in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<h2>How To Use Skill Books in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As you're adventuring as Indiana Jones, you'll be able to obtain Adventure Books. You can also call them Skill Books, as that is technically what they are. They provide new skills or buffs to your pre-existing skills, which can help you survive in the vast world you'll explore, as well as help you with combat and brawling. Picking up the book doesn't automatically mean that you've learned a new skill, though. By cycling to the Books tab in your main menu, you'll find a list of all of the books you've found under their relevant categories.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the books that are available in that category. If you hover over the book that interests you, it will tell you what you need to be able to use the book and learn the skill. To learn a skill, you need <strong>Adventure Points</strong>. Adventure Points are earned by finding secrets during your exploration, by collecting hidden items such as posters and letters, and even by taking pictures using your camera. There are plenty of things hidden in the world of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, making it easy for you to tally up Adventure Points fast enough, as long as you're thorough with your exploration and look in every nook and cranny you come across.</p>
<p>Once you have the required amount of Adventure Points, you'll then be able to learn the skill by reading the book, and the skill will be activated, allowing you to use it when you need to.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about how to use skill books in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Good luck exploring!</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2-focused event is being planned for May, suggesting, together with industry chatter, that the console could be released this June.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the latest episode of their podcast</a>, well-known insider NateDrake provided an update on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing and potential release date. Commenting on the rumored June release window for the system that's been making the rounds in the past few days, the insider mentioned that as of late September, early October, there's been a lot of industry chatter that placed the Nintendo Switch 2 release window between late May to June.&nbsp;There's still some uncertainty regarding this, but partners and publishers have been considering it as the release window for the system for the time being.</p>
<p>While NateDrake could not confirm if the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed releasing in the late May-June release window, the insider did reveal that an event focused on the system is currently being planned for May. The nature of the event is not clear, but it could be similar to the January 2017 event where Nintendo invited the media for some hands-on time with the original Switch. If the Japanese company was following a similar timeframe, the timing of the event suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 could indeed be released in June, which would be a great time to launch the system with the hands-on opportunities that could be offered during summer events like the Summer Game Fest and PAX East to generate more buzz on the system.</p>

<p>There's little doubt that partners are getting ready for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, as images and listings for the new<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/"> Joy-Con controller</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">accessories</a> have started appearing online. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to finally see what Nintendo has been working on for reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">quite a long time.</a></p>
