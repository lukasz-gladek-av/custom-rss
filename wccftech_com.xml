			<p>Techland has just released Dying Light: The Beast, the third installment (fourth if you count the original game's expansion pack The Following) in the first-person open world action game zombie series.</p>



<p>You can read our full game review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, written by David Carcasole. Here's an excerpt:</p>



<p><em>Dying Light: The Beast has two core pillars that are fairly strong, and if you are already a fan of the series, then there's sure to be plenty here for you to enjoy, even if it might not knock it out of the park in every element. If you're new to the series and have no prior attachments to it, but love a good zombie-killing game now and then, I'd push you to really consider how much you want to spend your money on this game, when there are so many better games to spend your time with in 2025.</em></p>



<p>In this article, I will concentrate exclusively on the game's technical side. The game utilizes an evolved version of Techland's proprietary C-Engine, last seen in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. As a reminder, Dying Light: The Beast was originally going to be the second DLC for Stay Human, and to be honest, it shows, at least visually.</p>



<p>Even though the development team stressed that there have been a number of significant technical improvements in the game to lighting, weather effects, skyboxes, materials, and foliage, to be honest, the game doesn't look that different. Furthermore, it looks pretty average for a 2025 triple-A game, even with all settings maxed out on PC. The texture work and lighting in particular stand out negatively when compared to top games in the genre. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Visuals could perhaps slightly improve post-launch. Techland had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-requirements-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4-intel-xess-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that Dying Light: The Beast would include ray-traced global illumination and reflections, but these are nowhere to be seen in the graphics options. We reached out to ask about their inclusion, but have not received a response so far. It is possible they might be coming later with a patch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The flip side is that the game doesn't even perform that well as is, and that is on top-of-the-line hardware. With a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and GeForce RTX 5090, the game averaged 236.2 frames per second with maxed settings at 4K resolution, DLSS Multi Frame Generation (x4), and DLAA. But there is a lot of variance; the 1% Low is at 129 FPS, and the 0.1% Low is at 85 FPS. What's worse, if you check the gameplay video, some stutters go down to 40-45 FPS, and in two instances (toward the end of the footage) even down to 9 or 20 FPS. Needless to say, it feels all the more jarring coming (and quickly returning to) from a very high average frame rate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Obviously, the side effects of this stuttering can be minimized, as always, by capping your frame rate. But doing so would effectively negate the benefit of having a display with a high refresh rate. It's a trade-off that might be worth it on a case-by-case basis and one that each user will ultimately have to decide for themselves.</p>



<p>One clear improvement over Dying Light 2: Stay Human is that Techland has introduced native support for HDR (High Dynamic Range) displays in this new game. The HDR calibration is well-made, offering detailed sliders for Maximum Luminance, Minimum Luminance, Brightness, Shadows, and UI Brightness. I would definitely recommend turning on HDR if you have the chance, as it can help combat the otherwise bland color palette available in regular SDR.</p>



<p>Overall, though, it is clear to me that Techland will have to significantly step up the technical game with their next title if they want to keep up with the ever-improving visual standard. Part of the reason for the middling visuals can be attributed to having to cater to legacy platforms like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, at a time when practically every triple-A game save for annual sports titles has dropped those aging consoles. Indeed, Techland should rather look forward. Given the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated goal to create games every three years or so</a>, its next game could very well arrive alongside the next-generation consoles (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a>), which will undoubtedly feature some impressive launch titles against which the next Dying Light installment would inevitably be compared.</p>

			<p>Techland has been working up to the third mainline installment in the series for the last few years since the launch of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">after a late delay</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">release date being moved forward</a>, Dying Light: The Beast is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>A new launch trailer premiered alongside the game going live on all platforms, showing even more gameplay off and giving players a recap on how they'll find returning protagonist Kyle Crane at the beginning of The Beast's story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Techland has also confirmed that the game is Steam Deck verified, so players can take their parkouring adventure on the go with them if they want. Rendering and audio director at Techland, Tomasz Szałkowski, said that he was "<em>personally driven</em>" to ensure that the game would run on Steam Deck, overseeing the creation of a special performance mode "<em>that contains a mix of tweaked settings and special optimizations together with HDR and VRR running smoothly on an OLED display.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Dying Light is back, and I couldn't be more proud of my team and the game we created</em>," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland's chief executive officer in a press release. "<em>Their passion, dedication, and hard work have resulted in something truly great. This project taught us more than any before about the importance of staying true to the core elements of our IP. For players, it's an exciting return to the roots of the series, and for us, we're back on the right track!</em>"</p>



<p>Franchise director Tymon Smektała added, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast is our love letter to the series and to the incredible Dying Light community. Our players have stood with us through highs and lows, and our greatest ambition with this project was to deliver the game that our community truly deserves. To all the fans of Kyle Crane and Dying Light, the moment is here. It's time to unleash The Beast!</em>"</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and while its tried-and-true approach to combat and parkour mechanics delivers an undeniably fun time, the overall package of the game was lacking in anything more substantial.</p>



<p>You can check out my full review for more details, and what led me to feeling that, "<em>Overall, those two pillars only keep the game interesting for as long as you want to keep your brain turned off. A dash of well-executed survival elements around those pillars doesn't make up for the rest of the ways the game is lacking, making Dying Light: The Beast a missable title as we move into the final months of 2025 with plenty of major releases on the horizon.</em>"</p>
