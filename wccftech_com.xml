			<p>The recently released Half-Life 2 RTX demo is not only a great showcase of the potential of NVIDIA RTX Remix but also of the DirectX 12 Ultimate Sampler Feedback feature, which has the potential to be quite a game-changer in terms of VRAM usage.</p>
<p>A new video shared earlier this week on YouTube by Compusemble shows Sampler Feedback streaming in action in the demo, showing how the technology can significantly reduce VRAM usage in pretty much every scenario. While the reduced VRAM usage doesn't lead to any significant performance improvement, the technology is definitely impressive and could definitely help improve image quality and performance in games running on GPUs with low VRAM capacity.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 2 RTX is an amazing showcase of what can be achieved using NVIDIA's RTX Remix, although the quality of the transformative upgrade is impacted by the change in the atmosphere of the original game. You can learn more about the demo by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</em></p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo is now available for download for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>

			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has a hidden 60 FPS mode, which suggests the recent game may have been future-proofed ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As confirmed by known modder MasaGrator, this 60 FPS mode is hidden in the game's executable but doesn't function properly, as enabling it causes some unspecified issues. While this mode could be some development leftover, it would definitely make more sense if its faulty implementation could be the basis upon which a Nintendo Switch 2 patch for the game could be built to allow the game to take advantage of the console's additional power and deliver a 60 FPS experience.</p>

- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked<br>
- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1 <a href="https://t.co/Ag09YVQ7g1">pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1</a></p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is the best way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to the improved UI, streamlined mechanics and new content, though the presentation could have been polished a little more. You can learn more about the game in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition brings one of Nintendo’s best open worlds to a new audience with confidence, offering up much-improved UI, smartly-streamlined mechanics, and some intriguing new content. While the game’s presentation could perhaps use a touch more polish, the game is an out-of-this-world Switch RPG worth experiencing before Nintendo launches its next hardware.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is now available on Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a pretty unique entry in the series in terms of gameplay, as it features a somewhat clear split between the stealth playstyle of classic entries in the series and the more combat-oriented style of recent games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla with its two protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. While both are pretty competent at what they do right from when they are introduced in the story, Yasuke, in particular, doesn't feel that good to play, even in combat. With some choice abilities, however, he becomes much more fun to play, so you should be looking into unlocking these abilities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you're into fighting enemies head-on, there's no better choice of protagonist than Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but you will often find yourself surrounded by multiple enemies. To fight multiple enemies effectively, you will want to equip a<strong> Naginata</strong> and learn the <strong>Crescent Strike</strong> ability. This Adrenaline ability is perfect to use when surrounded, as, by swinging the Naginata in a very wide arc, Yasuke knocks enemies down while also pushing them away, giving you some breathing room.</p>
<p>The second Naginata ability to learn as quickly as possible to make fights more fun and prevent things from dragging out too much is <strong>Impale</strong>. This ability can be used not only to reposition Yasuke but also to impale enemies on walls. If the enemy is still alive after the ability has been used, they will be knocked down and open for a grounded attack that is often fatal. Augmenting these abilities is the <strong>Combat Expert</strong> ability on the Long Katana Mastery skill tree, which increases damage with all melee weapons by a certain percentage each level, and the <strong>Increased Armor Damage</strong> on the Teppo Mastery skill tree, which increases armor damage by a certain percentage each level. <strong>Vigor</strong> abilities in the Samurai Mastery tree are also great skills to learn to get additional Adrenaline chunks and use these abilities more often.</p>

<p>If the Naginata is not the melee weapon you want to use in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are some Long Katana and Kanabo abilities you can learn to make them more effective and fun to use as well. The <strong>Sheathed Attack</strong> and the <strong>Sheated Posture</strong> are essential abilities to learn for the samurai's signature weapon, as a charged sheathed heavy attack on a guarding enemy has the chance to knock them down, opening them for a potentially lethal grounded attack. Even if it doesn't knock them down, a sheated posture attack is generally very strong and can kill weaker enemies if they are in a vulnerable state with a single hit.</p>
<p>The powerful Kanabo is also made better and more fun to use by two abilities, <strong>Devastation</strong> and <strong>Forward Momentum</strong>. The first unleashes a second combo ender when using a different type of attack after performing the first finisher, which is often a deadly combination against any sort of enemy. The second makes attacking much faster by pressing the next button in a combo with perfect timing, allowing Yasuke to deliver more devastating attacks more often. These two abilities synergize well with each other as well as with the <strong>Combo Ender Damage, </strong>making the Kanabo one of the strongest weapon types in the game in terms of sheer damage.</p>
