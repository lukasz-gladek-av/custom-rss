			<p>Borderlands 4, the next entry in the series launching later this year on PC and consoles, has become available for pre-order today, finally confirming the game's price.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-now-available-for-pre-order-post-launch-content-to-include-story-missions-and-all-new-vault-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> shared today, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the game's Standard Edition will launch in the United States for $69.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. For a few weeks, statements from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">suggested</a> the fourth entry in the series would be among the increasing number of games retailing at $80 at launch, but thankfully, that was not the case.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the price of the Borderlands 4 Standard Edition, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the details of the Deluxe Edition and the Super Deluxe Editions, which will retail for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively. The first will include the Bounty Pack Bundle featuring four separate post-launch DLC packs, each with distinct areas, new missions, and unique bosses; four Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards; new gear and weapons; four new vehicles, and Vault Hunter cosmetics; and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin. The second will include not only the Bounty Pack Bundle but also the Vault Hunter Pack featuring two new Story Packs, each featuring a new Vault Hunter, story, and side missions, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter cosmetics, and new ECHO-4 cosmetics.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th. The game will also be available at launch on the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Direct presentation for this week, a Donkey Kong Bananza Direct that'll premiere this&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, June 18, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>. It'll be a 15-minute-long presentation and will likely feature a bunch of new gameplay clips we've not seen before, ahead of the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> July 17, 2025</a>, release date.</p>
<p>The news first came through the Nintendo Today app, and is the latest sign that Nintendo will be using the app to deliver its big announcements before turning to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">its social media accounts</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em><span>Tune in at 6 a.m. PT on June 18 for a livestreamed</span> Donkey Kong Bananza <span>Direct presentation, featuring roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</span></em><span>," Nintendo said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p>It'll be good to see more of Donkey Kong Bananza on Wednesday, since there's still plenty about this game we don't yet know. <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch was able to preview the game</a> more than two months ago now, and at the time, while he didn't love everything about it, the game's core mechanic of being able to destroy the environment and how malleable the world is, makes for strong potential.</p>
<p>"<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully, on Wednesday, we'll see a little more of what's to come in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
