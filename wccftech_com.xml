			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/?trackingId=jGFh4qisSbKEPXgV6DMZRQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> his annual letter, which was published in the company's 2024 report, via LinkedIn. In the letter, Nadella discusses every major focus area for Microsoft: AI, security, business applications, professional social network (LinkedIn), search/ads/news, and gaming.</p>
<p>On this subject, the Microsoft CEO chose to highlight how the gaming side of the company has begun expanding its content (which now also includes all of Activision Blizzard King's franchises) on many more devices, and he seemed to hint that this trend will continue in the future.</p>
<p><em>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.</em></p>
<p>Nadella is, of course, referring to the big tectonic shift in Xbox's strategy that happened in February when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to bring four games to PlayStation 5 and/or Nintendo Switch: Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush. At the time, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans that the company had to find ways to attract new customers and that the whole gaming industry had to return to growth to stay sustainable. In June, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that more games would launch on other platforms in the future, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> at Gamescom 2024 to be coming to Sony's PlayStation 5 console just a few months after the PC and Xbox debut.</p>
<p>It is, after all, a strategy change that could have been foreseen in Nadella's own testimony rendered during the FTC vs Microsoft trial. At the time, the Microsoft CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/nadella-no-exclusives-blames-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>If it was up to me I would like to get rid of exclusivity on consoles. But that’s not for me to define, especially as a low-share player in the console market. The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that’s the world we live in. I have no love for that world.</em></p>
<p>True Xbox exclusives will be far and few between, then, as Microsoft aims to release its games on as many devices as possible, including competitor consoles and mobile, to maximize growth.</p>
