			<p>Developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive has released a new trailer for Killing Floor 3 ahead of its launch next week on July 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Technically, Killing Floor 3 should have been out for months by now. First announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/">Gamescom 2023</a>, it was initially due to arrive on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25, 2025</a>. However, just a week into March, Tripwire Interactive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">the shooter would be delayed</a>, and though it didn't reveal a new release date at the time, it promised it would arrive sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Two months later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">in May</a>, Tripwire confirmed that the delay would only last four months, with a new release date set for July 24, 2025. Today's new launch trailer seems to confirm that there won't be any more unexpected delays, and that players can look forward to jumping onto the killing floor next week with their friends regardless of platform, since Killing Floor 3 will support full crossplay between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, at launch.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 takes place 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2, and in that time, Horzine has created a horde of monstrous creatures called Zeds. Now, Mr. Foster and the Nightfall crew are the only thing standing between the army of Zeds and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If this trailer is to be believed, then Killing Floor 3 will be an explosive and action-packed game. We'll see how players respond to it when it arrives next week. </p>
