            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the end of June, amid a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">myriad of rumors</a> already circling about an incoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the actor who played Edward Kenway, Matt Ryan, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/">practically confirmed</a> that the remake was real and that it was coming soon. Ubisoft took notice and, according to Ryan, wasn't too pleased with his apparent slip-up and threatened the actor with a lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ryan admitted to the legal threat while signing the box of a fan's Edward Kenway figure at a recent convention. First posted to TikTok by kylo_hd659, and then shared on <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618">Twitter by TheHiddenOneAC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">Insider-Gaming</a>), Ryan is asked by the fan about his comments and about the upcoming remaster, to which he first responds by shrugging and saying, "<em>Don't know</em>."</p>



<p>The fan presses him further, and Ryan explains, "<em>Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this *gestures to person filming,* and I was being very free and open. But I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone, and then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didnâ€™t realize he was being recordedðŸ˜µ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>â€” The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that, as Ryan explained, he wasn't aware he was being filmed at the time. Sure, you can argue that he shouldn't have said anything if he didn't want the trouble from Ubisoft, but there's also an argument to be made that Ubisoft is being a bit overly litigious here. </p>



<p>Ubisoft's own co-founder and chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">confirmed in June 2024</a> that there were remakes of Assassin's Creed games coming. Anyone who knows anything about the Assassin's Creed franchise knows that Ubisoft and its decision-making executives would be dumber than they already seem to be at times, if they weren't working on a remake of Black Flag. Ubisoft has also been in dire need of some good press around its projects and what it has coming down the pipeline. </p>



<p>It honestly seems like a waste of a day for Ubisoft's lawyers to write up the legal threat in the first place. Surely they had better things to do with their time, and a simple message from someone on Ubisoft's team who works directly with actors like Ryan, telling him to stop talking about the remake and referencing it, would have sufficed. </p>



<p>But then again, we can't exactly be too surprised about a video game company being overly litigious, nor can we be surprised about a mismanagement of time and resources at Ubisoft.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's 2021 psychological horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> is being adapted into a film by Gary Dauberman, the man who horror fans will recognize as the writer and producer of the recent <em>It</em> and <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>



<p>Dauberman won't be writing on the project himself, as he is currently in the process of looking for a writer and director to helm the film. Dauberman's production company, Coin Operated, which he runs along with the company's president, Mia Maniscalco, will be producing the film.</p>



<p>Dauberman told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, who first reported the news of the adaptation, that "<em>With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, </em><em>The Medium</em> is a natural for a feature film adaptation. When I talked to Piotr [Babieno] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed. I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and Iâ€™m excited to be working alongside them."</p>



<p>For Bloober Team's part, chief executive officer Piotr Babieno added, "<em>Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with </em><em>The Medium</em>, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us. From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this film. Dauberman most recently worked on the adaptation of Until Dawn, which, by most accounts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/">did not impress audiences</a>. Whoever he gets to work on this adaptation as a writer and director will, of course, likely be the make-or-break element of this film.</p>



<p>The other interesting aspect about this adaptation news is that it brings into question what's happening with the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-the-medium-tv-series-the-witcher-producer/">TV series adaptation</a> of The Medium. The assumption, now that this film adaptation has been announced, is that nothing is happening with that series, and that it's another of dozens of projects that are born and die before they ever get close to audiences in the regular Hollywood churn. </p>



<p>Or perhaps we'll see the TV series be born again after this film with a different angle. Or maybe we'll see neither, as this film adaptation could see the same end the TV series did.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-deep-dives-into-ea-sports-fc-26-clubs-changes-including-archetype-revamps-support-for-multiple-clubs-and-more.1258551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-clubs-deep-dive">published a deep dive</a> into the changes it made in EA Sports FC 26 to Clubs, with revamps to archetypes and archetype progression, support for multiple clubs, dynamic Club Rush Live events, and more.</p>



<p>Regarding archetype progression, consumables are the new introduction to help players earn XP for their archetypes outside of playing matches or skill games, and to help players who didn't jump into FC 26 on day one and start building their clubs right away catch up to those who did. You'll unlock consumables through season pass and objective rewards, or through the Clubs Store. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while there will be multiple kinds of consumables available, some of the ones EA is introducing are Archetype XP multipliers and Direct Apply AXP, both of which boost AXP either through match rewards or just a direct boost. Archetype unlocks are exactly what they sound like, letting you unlock any of the remaining 12 archetypes you didn't pick when you first jump into clubs, and the same goes with Archetype Resets, which let you reset your attribute points and redistribute them.</p>

<p>FC 26 also introduces signature perks, which, according to EA, "<em>encourage you to embody your chosen archetype or specialization whenever you step onto the pitch</em>." Every archetype comes with two perks that you unlock through archetype progression, and a third can be applied when you have a specialization active.</p>



<p>Some perks are action-focused, which means they're based around you performing specific actions on the pitch, while others are mechanic or team-based. Mechanic perks focus on improving elements of your game, like your passing, while team-based perks improve how your computer-controlled teammates receive passes and control the ball.</p>



<p>Live events coming to Clubs are one of the other major changes in FC 26, with new events coming to Clubs regularly through single-elimination knockout rush tournaments. That said, you do have multiple attempts to make it out of the first round if you lose a match when starting a rush tournament. You're truly eliminated when you lose each attempt.</p>

<p>Some of the rush tournaments will have house rules like Rugby Rush, which is basically a 'no fouls' mode, or a Designated Scorer mode, where goals only count if they come from a designated player.</p>



<p>Players can now also be a member of up to three clubs at a time, switching between them at will through the Clubs menu, but that doesn't mean you'll earn rewards for all three when playing a match for one of them. So make sure you have the right club selected if you're trying to earn rewards for a specific one.</p>



<p>The big promise with this year's entry into EA's long-running football series has been to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/"><em>make gameplay better</em>,</a>" and address the myriad of issues that players have had with the game for years. It's clear that EA is putting in some kind of effort from these deep dives and its marketing, but whether it's all sizzle and no steak is something we won't know until FC 26 launches on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on September 26, 2025.</p>
