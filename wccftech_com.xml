			<p>According to the developers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> will launch in June 2025, opening up a new era for the game with the biggest and most transformative evolution in its ten-year history.</p>
<p>The new trailer shared today, which can be watched below, provides a new look at what Siege X will bring on June 10th, such as a major visual overhaul, an enhanced player experience, and some gameplay changes that will improve the game's tactical core.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Reveal Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0Hw96M5bC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of the new features that will come with Rainbow Six Siege X this June include a new play mode called Dual Front, a permanent 6v6 game mode that will be set on the game's biggest map to date. In this mode, players will be able to form squads by picking between 35 different operators and proceed to secure enemy sectors while defending their own. While this new play mode will only be available when Rainbow Six Siege X launches, players will be able to test it out this week with a limited-time closed beta that will run from March 13th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET to March 19th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET. To get access to the beta, players will need to connect their Twitch and Ubisoft Connect accounts and watch either the Showcase on the<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Official Rainbow 6 Twitch channel</a> or other <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">livestreams</a>.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X will also visually enhance classic maps with new lighting, shadows, and up to 4K textures. Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank and Kafe will be upgraded at launch, with three additional upgraded maps added each season. The update also introduces gameplay features that deepen the game's tactical core, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items (fire extinguishers, gas pipes, and metal detectors) provide additional strategic opportunities to surprise and outmaneuver opponents</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls that allow players to run horizontally and jump around building corners</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation so that players may better pinpoint the location of enemy players</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X will be free to access on June 10. New players will be able to play in the Dual Front, Unranked, and Quick Play modes, with the ability to earn up to 26 operators through progression. By upgrading to the Premium Edition, they can subsequently unlock Ranked Mode and the Siege Cup once they reach level 50, giving them instant access to more operators. Current players will retain all previously unlocked content, including operators, inventory, and progression, and will receive exclusive veteran rewards based on the year they joined the game.</p>
