			<p>Ubisoft has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> is now available on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Amazon Luna). The sizable update improves graphics and adds new content, but also brings free access to the game, allowing newcomers to join with a selection of operators and play Unranked, Quick Match, and Dual Front modes without paying. Certain features like Ranked playlists, Siege Cup, additional operators, and cosmetics require payment to unlock.</p>
<p>Two of the available options are the Elite Edition, which grants access to all game modes, including Ranked playlists and Siege Cup, and 16 additional operators for $19.99, and the Ultimate Edition, which also unlocks all game modes, the Ranked playlists and the Siege Cup, but adds immediate access to 52 Operators and the Disruptor Pack for a price of $39.99.</p>

<p>In Rainbow Six Siege X, players will experience the brand-new permanent 6v6 mode, Dual Front. For the first time, Dual Front mixes Attackers and Defenders to seize enemy sectors while defending their own. During matches, players can respawn, change their selected operator, and complete time-limited Neutral Sector assignments. Siege X also introduces significant upgrades and overhauls to the graphics, gameplay, and audio.</p>
<p>At launch, five modernized 5v5 maps received upgrades to lighting, shadows, and resolution: Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe. Three new 5v5 maps will be modernized each season thereafter.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege X is deeper thanks to new destructible items, including gas pipes, metal detectors, and fire extinguishers. Players can interact with these items strategically to outplay their opponents. Rappel navigation and momentum movement have also been improved, providing more fluid controls. Players can now sprint horizontally along walls on rappel and maneuver around building corners.</p>
<p>The audio propagation and reverberation have been overhauled, making the game sound more realistic than before. This enables players to gather critical intelligence through audio cues, allowing them to pinpoint the location and type of rooms where enemy players are on the map. Lastly, Ubisoft Montr√©al has added a new onboarding experience that will help new players build their skills and confidence.</p>
