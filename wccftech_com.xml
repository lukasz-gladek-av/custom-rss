            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch, the upcoming soccer game from Sifu developer Sloclap, is due to arrive for everyone this <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Thursday, June 19, 2025</a>.&nbsp;</strong>It should be an exciting launch for the studio, as Rematch had an extremely popular beta test with more than 1.9 million players jumping in on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>But that excitement has been significantly quelled, with today's reveal by Sloclap that the game will not support cross-play between players on other platforms.</p>
<p>"<em>Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch,</em>" <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143">Sloclap announced in a post on the game's official X account</a>. "<em>But it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934628094624567591">separate post</a>, Sloclap said it "<em>aimed for launch but couldn't quite get it ready in time. We're actively working on it.</em>"</p>
<p>Rematch is already available for those who paid for early access, and it was only about an hour before that early access launch that Sloclap delivered the disappointing news about cross-play functionality. It's clear the team was trying to have it ready in time, but delivering the news so close to the game's early access release, the one reserved for those who paid extra for the privilege of playing three days early, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lcua7w/the_game_still_feels_like_a_beta/">upsetting players online</a>.</p>
<p>The mood around Rematch isn't helped by the fact that players are reporting major server issues impacting their experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Golden Rules Trailer | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFMw23F-KbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hopefully, by the time the game is available for everyone on Thursday, Sloclap has resolved the biggest of its server issues, and players are able to have a smoother time than they are now. And hopefully it doesn't all break again once cross-play support is added.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> is a wonderfully immersive game that allows players to insert themselves in the world of Arrakis and play among the sandworms and political intrigue the series is known for, but before you get to any of that, you need to live long enough to see it.</p>
<p>Surviving on Arrakis in Dune: Awakening is, whether you like it or not, painfully accurate to what it would be like if you were to try living on the desert planet for longer than a day. And it doesn't exactly help your case that the game begins with your player character crash-landing on the planet, with barely anything but the clothes on your back.</p>
<p>While you are guided through some concrete survival steps in the game's opening hours, this guide will take you through the minutiae of what it takes to survive on Arrakis, and the new way of thinking you'll need to adjust to in order to make sure you'll be able to see the sun rise on a new day on Dune.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - Tips for Surviving Arrakis</h2>
<h4>ABP - Always Be Prepared</h4>

<figure></figure>

<p>On one level, always being prepared means having the tools and resources you'll need to survive at the ready. But more accurately, it means developing habits that ensure you never get caught off guard.</p>
<p>For example, having enough dart ammo in your backpack or making sure your literjon of water is filled before heading out is easy enough to remember, but you also want to make sure you're not without survey probes. Surveying new areas is an absolute must because it'll clear away the fog from the new parts of the map you're exploring and give you a clear picture of how to travel safely.</p>
<p>If you don't know where the actual closest rock formation is to your current location, it's easy to get caught out in open sand for too long. And you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> want to be caught in open sand for too long. That's a fast track to losing everything in the gullet of a sandworm.</p>
<p>This is also why your map is arguably your biggest support for everything you'll do in Dune: Awakening. Knowing where to go next so you're safely travelling across the planet is one thing, but another is the fact that your map will also show you where to gather resources you need to stay alive and craft the vehicles and devices you need to aid your survival. ABP means keeping your map up to date, your inventory stocked with essentials, and ensuring that you can handle whatever situations come your way.</p>
<h3>Store your vehicle(s)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Take it from someone who has already gone through this experience. Store your vehicle, do not simply leave it next to your base in a shaded area, thinking that'll be enough to keep it safe from the elements on Arrakis. It isn't, and you'll return to your time away from the game with a bike that's wrecked beyond repair.</p>
<p>When you reach the point where you're crafting your first bike to drive across the sands, you'll also be able to craft a device that'll let you store your bike and redeploy it when you need to make those longer treks across Dune. You should consider this device now part of your permanent inventory, as it is a key piece of kit to have if you plan to do any kind of quick travelling between various points of interest on the planet.</p>
<h3>Build for mobility, not for settlements (at first)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>When you first start building your own base, it's tempting to begin to design your dream home on Arrakis. There's already excellent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcuvbl/first_base_ive_ever_been_proud_of_spent_so_long/">examples</a> on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lalsnm/people_here_are_posting_some_awesome_futuristic/"> Dune: Awakening Reddit page</a> of really impressive bases, in terms of design, and<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcl2z7/who_needs_thopters_i_have_a_ramp/"> functionality</a>. These are not the kinds of bases you should look to grind out and build off the top.</p>
<p>In the same way you can store a vehicle, you can store a bases design - but not the base itself. That, you'll have to rebuild, using your construction tool as you move deeper into Arrakis and away from Hagga Basin.</p>
<p>You will reach a point where it is worth building a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-extensive-base-building-feature/">permanent settlement</a> that you'll return to time and again, but there's no point in trying to make your first base that permanent home. Not only will it make your attempts at keeping it with you as you move into Arrakis more difficult, since you'll almost certainly not be able to hold enough materials to build it all at once wherever you decide to put down your sub-fief, but abandoning your first base is in fact a mission objective in the early hours of the game.</p>
<p>So until it makes sense, don't get attached to your base. Oh, and as a side note for when you do build your permanent base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l7tan4/example_immersive_build_without_ruining_pathing/">make sure you're not blocking anyone's path</a>. It's annoying enough to have to plan your travel across the sands around not being out in the open for too long. You don't want to add to that by being the person who build their base between two rock formations causing a route blockage for everyone else in your server.</p>
<h3>Keep the lights on in your base, or risk losing it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Speaking of your base, you absolutely need to ensure it always has power. The generator you build for your base does more than just keep your fabricator or blood purifier working, it also generates a shield for your base to protect it from the elements on Arrakis. If you don't keep it powered up, you risk your base being picked apart by the elements - or worse, picked clean by other players raiding your stuff.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see how long your base can maintain power for, and if you don't have every machine in it crafting large-scale devices then the drain on its fuel won't be too dire at all. It's not a difficult thing to keep it powered, but it can be an easy thing to forget. And survival always seems to come down to not forgetting the little things.</p>
<h3>You won't win against a sandworm, a sandstorm, or the sun, so don't chance it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are three elements of Arrakis that you simply won't win against and should not take your chances on. Sandworms, sandstorms, and the sun.</p>
<p>The sandworms are a pretty obvious one. They're huge, will swallow you and everything you have on you whole, and are to be avoided at all times. Shai-Hulud is respected and worshipped for a reason, and as far as we know, Funcom has no plans to add a skill-tree where the end goal is gaining the powers of Atreides descendant <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Sheeana_Brugh">Sheeana</a>. Make sure you have an escape plan, whether that's heading to the nearest rock formation, or flying out of there with an orinthopter, when sandworms are close by.</p>
<p>Sandstorms on Arrakis are to be feared just as much, and you'll need to ensure you have a way of taking shelter should you hear the warning that one is headed towards your area. Once the warnings begin, every moment spent out in the open to gather more resources or make it to your next destination is done at your own peril.</p>
<p>Lastly, the sun is the third part of this trifecta of terror that you need to always be aware of when travelling the sands of Arrakis. It will boil you faster than you think, dehydrate you faster, and slowly tick down your health if you're caught out in it for too long. This is why you should always travel at night, especially in the early hours of the game when you're working your way up to building your first bike. You travel, build, basically do anything, at your own peril in the heat of the Arrakis sun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods</a>, likely the biggest and most popular repository for game mods that PC players have relied on for more than two decades, has been sold, the previous owner and creator, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed">Dark0ne, announced</a>.</p>
<p>Dark0ne ran the site for 24 years and made the decision to sell and step back from the day-to-day operations of the website after it took too much of a personal toll on them.</p>
<p>"<em>The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,</em>"&nbsp;Dark0ne wrote in their blog post announcing the sale.</p>
<p>"<em>The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole</em>."</p>
<p>While Dark0ne doesn't disclose who the new owner of the website is, they do make it clear that they are confident that the site is being passed into good hands.</p>
<p>"<em>One of the biggest reasons I've been doing this for so long is that I've never felt that I truly found someone who really "gets" the modding community the way I do. Finding a new owner who would be able to understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community was essential.</em></p>
<p><em>After months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task.</em></p>
<p><em>So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate “exit” or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.</em>"</p>
<p>Dark0ne continues to say that on the player and modder side of things, there won't really be any changes, and that the biggest change is simply the ownership, and the fact that Dark0ne won't be the person who has to sign-off on everything happening with the website.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-crossed-the-10-billion-downloads-milestone/">Nexus Mods crossed 10 billion mod downloads</a> in its lifetime. An impressive feat, and a solid one for Dark0ne to leave on at the end of their tenure. It'll be interesting to see who is taking over the site, if/when the new ownership is disclosed. So many players around the world rely on Nexus Mods. For their sake, and the sake of the PC modding community, hopefully this new era for the site is even better than the last.</p>
