			<p>The Halo: Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">we've all been anticipating today</a>, as part of the Halo WCC, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">has finally been announced</a>. Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake that Halo Studios and Xbox describe as "<em>a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign</em>." It'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>We've officially seen it all now, with all of Microsoft and Xbox's biggest first-party franchises making their way to PlayStation. It was the inevitable endpoint we all saw when Halo Studios (formerly 343 Studios) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-halo-infinite-impact-vision/">dropping the Slipspace Engine and moving to using Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>It's both exciting and surreal to see Halo making its way to PlayStation for the first time. You can check out the trailer for the remade campaign, below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as what's new in this remake, the answer is pretty much everything, since all of the assets, models, environments, everything has been redone and retooled for Unreal Engine 5, and to take advantage of all the features that engine brings along with it that Halo Studios couldn't do within the Slipspace Engine.</p>



<p>There are also three brand-new bonus missions that act as a prequel setup to the main campaign. The actual Combat Evolved campaign hasn't been changed with regards to how the story goes, these are new missions to give players a bit more than just a remake of the campaign.</p>



<p>Campaign Evolved also introduces four-player co-op for the whole campaign, letting you play through the campaign with three other people online. Also, even though Halo Studios never got it done for Halo Infinite, couch co-op is available for Campaign Evolved for two player co-op.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the trailer, and the above roundtable, which shares a little more about why Halo Studios went forward with Halo: Campaign Evolved at this point in time, we also got a full 13-minute gameplay showcase, which shows off the The Silent Cartographer level towards the beginning of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as what this new remake doesn't have, the big aspect missing that should be obvious, given the title of the remake, is that it doesn't include the game's multiplayer. It's just the campaign. If you want to play multiplayer in the style of Halo CE, then the Master Chief Collection remains your best option.</p>



<p>All things considered, this remake definitely looks impressive at first glance, but a huge element of what made Halo unique was how the game felt thanks to the Slipspace Engine and everything that Bungie got right about what makes a good first-person shooter all those years ago. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react when they get their hands on it at some point next year.</p>



<p>For now, you can wishlist the game on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

			<p>It's been a decade-long journey so far, and it'll have been over a decade by the time its finished, but we're nearing the completion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. With Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 currently in development, we're on the lookout for any bit of information we can get, and in a recent <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">interview with VGC</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a little more insight into the game's development.</p>



<p>Recently, Hamaguchi spoke about how he's looking to provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">"<em>a new gaming experience</em>" </a>for players with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, by which he meant Part 3 will have a different kind of focus compared to its predecessors. He also commented that he believes the conclusion to this decade-plus trilogy journey <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">will satisfy old and new fans alike</a>, and with regard to when the game is coming, we heard from Tetsuya Nomura recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">that Part 3 is "<em>on schedule</em>."</a></p>



<p>In this interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">VGC</a>, Hamaguchi doubles down on how development for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing, saying, "<em>We're working really hard on the third game in the Remake series at the moment. It's coming along really</em> <em>well. I've got in my head the vision now, the gameplay structure, the gameplay experience, the core experience, and it's looking in a really good state.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It's something really satisfying that gamers can get their teeth into, and it'll be just a brilliant experience that it really should be and has to be. So we're going to work on that, brush that up even further, and then deliver it in the not-too-distant future. You really can look forward to the climax of the series, and it'll be exactly what you want it to be. So don't worry about that.</em> <em>It's coming, and it's just as good as you think it is. I'm very confident in the game that I'm making there.</em>"</p>



<p>Separately in the interview, Hamaguchi also commented about <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">Part 3 coming to Nintendo Switch 2, along with the rest of the trilogy</a>. He did his best to reassure players that they don't have to worry about how the games will run on Switch 2, saying they've done "<em>some Switch 2-specific optimizations and further tweaks</em>" to make sure that the games will perform well on Nintendo's new console.</p>



<p>All things considered, it's good to hear how confident Hamaguchi is about Part 3, and it's good to hear that we'll get to see more in "<em>the not-so-distant future</em>." With one last major event left for the rest of the year, we might even be close enough to find out the official name of Part 3 at The Game Awards later this year.</p>
