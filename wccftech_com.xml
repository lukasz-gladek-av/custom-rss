			<p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has filed a legal claim against Rockstar Games, following the game developer's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly fire 31 workers from the Edinburgh office</a> (and three more in Canada). As we previously covered, Rockstar claimed the terminations were due to 'gross misconduct', which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> as 'leaking information on a public forum'; however, the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain</a> that they had been on the verge of unionization after reaching the 10% threshold required by law.</p>



<p>Thus, the IWGB considers this a brazen act of union busting. After a series of protests held in front of the Rockstar North headquarters, the union asked the studio to voluntarily reinstate the workers, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wanted to return to work and finish their project (Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now scheduled for November 19, 2026</a>).</p>



<p>However, yesterday afternoon, the union <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Rockstar refused to meet, forcing them to issue the claim. The IWGB's legal department shared the following statement:</p>



<p><em>We are representing employees who were dismissed by Rockstar Games in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity. Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants. Our members allege that Rockstar’s conduct constitutes trade union victimisation and blacklisting.</em></p>



<p>IWGB President Alex Marshall added: </p>



<p><em>We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law. This case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers - we will not be intimidated.</em></p>



<p>Notably, a legal claim is not the same thing as a lawsuit. Instead, it is an informal request to resolve the matter outside of court. However, if the legal claim isn't successful, the IWGB and the former Rockstar employees will likely have to file a proper lawsuit. Needless to say, the proceedings could take a lot of time, forcing some of them to look elsewhere for employment in the meantime.</p>

			<p>Red Dead Redemption may be coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a fresh finding.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the ESRB posted <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">a new rating</a> for the classic Old West open-world game developed by Rockstar Games for the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo current-generation systems. <span>The rating is unsurprisingly identical to the ones of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39915/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39512/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PlayStation 4,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39439/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;ports, an M for Mature 17+ due to the presence of blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, and more.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-new-port-of-red-dead-redemption">What's The Point of a New Port of Red Dead Redemption?</h2>



<p>Today's rating is somewhat surprising as Red Dead Redemption is already playable on all three systems via backward compatibility. As such, a new native release for current-generation systems can only mean that some new technical features should be included. In regard to content, no surprise should be expected due to the rating summary being identical across all versions of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-red-dead-redemption-be-improved-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s">How Can Red Dead Redemption Be Improved on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The new Red Dead Redemption console ports may finally offer 60 FPS and beyond gameplay on all systems.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the game can be played on current-generation consoles via backward compatibility, the experience may not be the best for the most demanding players, as 60 FPS gameplay is only available on PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PlayStation 4</th><th>Nintendo Switch</th><th>Xbox Series X|S</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1080p (PS4), upscaled to 4K on PS5</td><td>1080p docked / 720p handheld</td><td>1440p on Series S<br>Native 4K on Series X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 FPS (locked), 60 FPS on PlayStation 5</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance Enhancements</strong></td><td>Stable frame pacing, improved texture filtering</td><td>Optimized for handheld and docked play</td><td>Enhanced resolution, improved filtering, Auto-HDR</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">PC port of Red Dead Redemption, on the other hand, is the most advanced</a>, offering up to 144 FPS gameplay, among other improvements that set it decisively above every other version of the game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Red Dead Redemption PC Port Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution Support</strong></td><td>Up to native 4K resolution and ultrawide monitor support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>Up to 144 FPS support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong></td><td>Improved textures, enhanced shadows, updated anti-aliasing, higher draw distance, and overall graphical refinements, HDR 10 support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Features</strong></td><td>NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.0, DLSS Frame Generation Support</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Considering the PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S have the horsepower to run what's basically an enhanced port of a PS3, Xbox 360 era game at high resolution and framerates, it's very likely the new Red Dead Redemption console ports will attempt to reach parity with the PC version in this regard. </p>



<p>Hopefully, a few more surprises will also be included in this new port, but even without any, improved resolution and framerates should be more than enough to make Red Dead Redemption an enjoyable experience on modern consoles.</p>
