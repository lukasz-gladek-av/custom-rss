			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has released the latest monthly charts for US video game sales for October 2025, and the two games at the top of the charts are the two games you would have expected to be there: Battlefield 6 and Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Those were the top two games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> in first place and Pokémon Legends Z-A in second, though it's worth remembering that Nintendo doesn't share its digital sales data with any of the big analytics firms, Circana included, which means that on physical sales alone, it had a stronger month than 18 other games, some of them new releases, some of them sales-charts-topping regulars like EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26.</p>



<p>It also could mean that, were digital sales properly included, Pokémon Legends Z-A might have been listed as the actual best-selling premium game in the US for October 2025. But we can't know its digital sales, so that crown goes to Battlefield 6.</p>







<p>Number one on the sales charts for the month of October in the US isn't the only crown Battlefield 6 is walking away with, as it also launched right to the top of the list for best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>According to Piscatella, not only did Battlefield 6 become the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, it also "<em>produced the highest single month US physical and digital full game tracked dollar sales total in three years. The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October 2022</em>."</p>







<p>It's all coming up roses for Battlefield 6 on the commercial front, but it's one month away from perhaps the biggest victory it could hope for, which would be maintaining its top spot over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November 2025 sales numbers are in.</p>



<p>Of course, we'll have to wait a while for those numbers, but for now, Battlefield 6 can bask in its top spot for the month, for the year, and in the history of the franchise. Also, it's worth noting that while Battlefield 6 may be the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, when it comes to exclusively physical sales, the best-selling game in the US so far is Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Other notable elements of the list include <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">September 2025's best-selling game in the US</a> dropping all the way to the tenth best-selling game, with Borderlands 4 going from the top spot to halfway down the top-20 list.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was also able to squeeze into the top-10 in seventh place, just ahead of another new release, Little Nightmares III, which made the list in eighth place. Ninja Gaiden 4, another big new release for October 2025, made the top-20 list, but not the top-10, as it fell just outside the top-10 in eleventh place. </p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be the best-selling console, though what's more impressive is how far ahead it is compared to Nintendo Switch sales for the same time period of its launch year. "<em>It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4's previous record velocity</em>," writes Piscatella.</p>



<p>Another notable hardware tidbit is that spending on ASUS PC portable hardware saw a 4.8x spike led by he release of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. You can find out more about both devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">my interview with ASUS executives last month,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">in my review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, October 2025 was a strong month for video game sales in the US. It saw a 3% growth over October 2024, and included a couple of the year's best-selling games so far. However, the real bout of the year for US sales is currently happening right now, between Call of Duty and Battlefield, with both games officially out and available for players to buy. We'll see which game ends up at the top of the charts for November 2025.</p>

			<p>Another week, another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-Ultimate-is-everywhere/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud gaming service</a>. This week, eight games are entering the service, while an additional title is added to the list of games playable with the RTX 5080-powered Blackwell servers. Also, those servers are just one region away from completing NVIDIA's campaign to make them available worldwide.</p>



<p>Regarding the games joining the service this week, the heavy-hitters are titles like the highly anticipated Persona-like indie game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the early access release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-pubg-productions/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, the new survival game from PUBG Productions that's finally releasing in early access. It's a different kind of class of heavy-hitters <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/">compared to last week's batch of games,</a> but they're heavy hitters nonetheless.</p>



<p>As far as the game that's now RTX 5080-ready, it's Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. A game that definitely didn't get off to a great start with players, but has since been updated for a much smoother experience that doesn't involve a bunch of frustrating insta-fail stealth missions. At least it was always a good looking game, and now that you can play it through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, it can look even better.</p>



<p>Speaking of those Blackwell servers, last week it was Phoenix getting added to the list of regions where RTX 5080 servers were available. The only remaining region on NVIDIA's list now is Stockholm, which isn't ready to go live this week, but will be ready soon. As a reminder, the Blackwell servers are only available to players subscribed to GeForce NOW at the Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>"<em>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere</em>," head of partnerships and licensing at 2K, Sean Haran, added with regard to GeForce NOW in a press release. "<em>Anyone can experience the glory of Borderlands 4, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you're at home or on the move.</em>"</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spongebob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide</li>



<li>Long Drive North</li>



<li>Demonschool</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</li>



<li>Prologue: Go Wayback!</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>



<li>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Sacred 2 Remaster</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>
