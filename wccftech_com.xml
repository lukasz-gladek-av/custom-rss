			<p>Japanese developer<strong> Game Freak</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the first proper look at their new franchise</a>, <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>, during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct Show 2026</strong>. Following that appearance, several gamers noted the <strong>apparent similarities with the Soulslike genre</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Famitsu</a>, Game Director <strong>Kota Furushima</strong> revealed <strong>several key differences</strong>, such as the design goal of making the game completable even for those who are not action game experts, and the ability for players to lower the difficulty. This is <strong>famously absent in most Soulslike games</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We're trying to make it so that even people who aren't good at action games can enjoy it. You can also choose the difficulty level, so if you're unsure, I think it's best to lower the difficulty level. Personally, I'd be happy if people could enjoy the game by taking an approach that actually lowers the difficulty level, by devising the skill tree system and Koo's support.</em></p>



<p>That's not to say there won't be times when you will be challenged in Beast of Reincarnation. Again, though, Furushima stressed that <strong>they're not trying to make a game where you're forced to fight a boss hundreds of times</strong>, which is practically a key component of a Soulslike game.</p>



<p><em>I think there will be times when you get defeated, and I want players to enjoy trial and error, trying different fighting styles next time, or changing Kuu's skills. However, I don't intend for players to never be able to clear the game on their first try, or to have to retry dozens or hundreds of times, so I hope that players will pick it up without being too scared.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Game Director confirmed that the protagonists, <strong>Emma the Sealer and Koo, each have three skill trees</strong>, enabling a variety of playstyles. For example, as well as close-range combat, you can attack with long-range weapons and perform stealth actions. There are also other ways to change your fighting style; while you can learn action-oriented skills, you can also acquire passive skills that simply boost Emma and Koo's stats or recovery rate.</p>



<p>Beast of Reincarnation is currently slated for a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> launch window on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>. Stay tuned for more details as the release date approaches.</p>
