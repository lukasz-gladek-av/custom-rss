			<p>NetEase has revealed the new convergence mode K'un-Lun: Heart of Heaven map that will be arriving in Marvel Rivals later this week, on September 25, 2025. The Summer Special Vol.2 is also now live in the game, and players can start to earn free cosmetics from the limited event until it closes on October 17, 2025. </p>



<p>This is the latest update since Marvel Rivals' <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">Season 4 debuted earlier this month on September 12</a>, which also brought a new hero, Angela, to the game. Though perhaps more important was the fact that Season 4 marked the addition of a new playable platform for Marvel Rivals, with the game making its way to PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>The map reveal trailer shows off the vistas and intricately decorated hallways that will provide the backdrop for players' clashes, though as with any shooter, you won't get to really be familiar with the map until you've had the chance to play it yourself. At least the trailer allows you to take in the work NetEase put into the visual design of the map, since you'll likely be too focused on the match to notice when in-game.</p>

<p>New character cosmetics for Hela will also arrive alongside the map on Thursday, which you can see in the clip NetEase shared to X (formerly Twitter) below.</p>

<p>Shortly after Marvel Rivals came to PS4, NetEase introduced the game's technical director, Fanfan, to players in a new video series called 'Technically Speaking.' In its inaugural video, Fanfan addressed concerns that have surfaced from players around the game's performance and offered some explanation as to what the studio is doing to try to fix the issues.</p>



<p>He also pointed to a standard test that PC players can run on their devices, to help determine where their graphical settings should be to ensure they get the smoothest, most stable experience possible during gameplay. Switching around your settings won't solve every issues players have, but it's the best place to start trying.</p>
