			<p>S-Game's Phantom Blade Zero made more than a few heads turn when it was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">2023</a> with its haunting dark setting and intense action gameplay. The game looked so nice that many believed the trailer wasn't a proper representation of the experience, myself included, but every doubt I had about what looked like yet another soulslike were completely squashed last year when I had the chance to try out a few slices of the game during <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Gamescom 2024 </a>focused on extremely satisfying combat and action gameplay whose best qualities managed to shine through even in a version of the game that was clearly rather far from release. And although I felt combat was great, I couldn't help but wonder how the rest of the experience would shape up.</p>



<p>An answer to this question arrived during this year's Gamescom, when I was given the chance to try out two different demos of the action game in development by S-Game. Both demos, an earlier demo available during a press-only event held by NVIDIA one day before Gamescom began, and the one that attendees could try out themselves after braving some of the longest lines I have seen during the show, featured more of the incredible combat showcased in the game's first public demo, but also exploration and traversal to round up the experience.</p>



<p>In this regard, it definitely feels like Phantom Blade Zero will deliver as much as it does for combat. Both locations, with a clear eastern feel, sported an intricate linear design with tons of different paths where items and optional enemies could be found, alongside some NPCs who provided some additional information on the current state of things. Exploring these locations completely will require players to take advantage of Soul's impressive agility and some tools, which feel great to use thanks to the incredible animation work based on motion capture. Better yet, using all of Soul's traversal abilities and tools feels incredibly intuitive to use, making exploration as engaging as combat.</p>

<p>Although I already have found the game's combat incredibly engaging without being unfairly challenging last year, I couldn't help but notice how Phantom Blade Zero has been significantly improved in this regard since last year. The final game will feature a vast selection of weapons, and although only a small portion of them were available in the Gamescom demo, it was easy to tell how much care S-Game is putting into making each one better suited for different playstyles and enemies. Secondary weapons, for example, range from long-range weapons to heavier hitting melee weapons, and the ability to switch between two different main and secondary weapons on the fly not only allows for plenty of flexibility, but it's an actual game mechanic that players should use to extend their combos as much as possible once an enemy is left staggering after depleting some sort of posture gauge with attacks and proper parries. As such, fighting enemies is downright satisfying, as the game requires alternating between different offensive and defensive like in the best character-action games, but without being extremely punishing in the vein of games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, at least at normal difficulty.</p>



<p>The highlight of the Phantom Blade Zero Gamescom 2025 demo were, unsurprisingly, the boss battles. The fight against the massive Wan Jun was intense but easily manageable after a few tries, especially once I had a better grasp of the many abilities at Soul's disposal, which require resources to further extend combos performed by alternating light and heavy attacks. The fight against the Disciples of the Seven Stars was similarly easily manageable after a few tries, but it was considerably more stunning to experience, thanks to the aforementioned amazing animation work and combat design, which provides Soul with all the tools to deal with multiple enemies at once in spectacular fashion.</p>



<p>Speaking with an S-Game representative during my playthrough of the Phantom Blade Zero, the game has been defined as a Soulslite, which I have found to be an apt description of a game that takes the best features of modern action games and action role-playing games to offer an intense experience that is as pleasing to the eye as it is incredibly fun to play. Thankfully, we may not have to wait much longer to learn when Phantom Blade Zero will launch on PC and consoles, as I have been told a release date will be announced soon.</p>

			<p>A Dino Crisis remake was reportedly attempted twice, but the projects were later scrapped due to low quality.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on X, known CAPCOM leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a> revealed that, in the past few years, CAPCOM attempted to bring back the survival horror series with a remake of the first game. The first attempt was from CAPCOM Vancouver before they were shut down, while the second one was from an unspecified CAPCOM team a few years ago. This project, however, wasn't turning out good and was eventually scrapped.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) I hope Capcom eventually figures out what they want to do with Dino Crisis. For the record, &amp; I don't believe this is new info, but there has been a couple attempts in the last decade to remake Dino Crisis, the first by Capcom Vancouver before they were shut down (still <a href="https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX">https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763101613318388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although previous attempts at developing a Dino Crisis remake have reportedly failed, there's a good chance the classic survival horror series may be close to a comeback. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Earlier this year</a>, the series was trademarked again in Japan, something that is usually done in the country when there's a real intention of using an IP again, and in Brazil a few months ago. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-dino-crisis-trademark-revival/">Brazilian filing</a> is particularly interesting, as the series was trademarked again at the same time CAPCOM filed a trademark for Resident Evil Requiem, and with a similar trademark class, entertainment and video games. Hopefully, these trademarks really mean something is in the works for a series that is long overdue its return.</p>



<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, but the classic franchise made a small comeback earlier this year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">GOG release</a> of the first two entries in the series, complete with new features and improvements such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-handheld-specs-leaked-will-easily-outperform-xbox-rog-ally-x-base-playstation-5-with-patched-games.1282713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 handheld specifications have leaked online, suggesting the yet-to-be-announced handheld should comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 in certain scenarios.</p>



<p>In a new video shared earlier today on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who has recently proved to be quite reliable regarding PlayStation leaks, revealed some new information on the portable system, which has been obtained via up-to-date documentation. The handheld will be powered by the Canis APU, a monolithic 135mm square die manufactured on a TSMC 3nm node featuring 4 Zen 6c CPU cores and 2 Zen 6 Low Power cores that will run the operating system and all non-gaming tasks with 4MB of L3 for the Zen 6c CCX, a 16 CUs RDNA5 GPU clocked at around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and around 1.65GHz in docked mode and a 192-bit LPDDR5X-8533 memory controller with support to up to 48GB of RAM. Rounding up the features of the handheld are backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, a MicroSD slot, M.2 slot, haptic feedback support, dual mics and a touchscreen.</p>



<p>There is no solid information regarding how much RAM the PlayStation 6 handheld will feature, but it is expected to feature more than 16 or even 24 GB. Asked to comment on the matter, some unspecified developers unanimously agreed that the amounts above wouldn't be enough to run next-generation games with AI features, as even features like UE5's Nanite require a lot of RAM to work properly. As such, these developers believe that anything between 24 and 36 GB of RAM is required for next-gen games.</p>



<p>With these leaked specs seemingly revealed, MLiD also made some performance estimation for the unrevealed PlayStation 6 handheld. Rasterization performance is expected to be between 0.55 and 0.75 times that of the PlayStation 5 in docked mode, while ray tracing performance is between 1.3 and 2.6, which would bring the handheld close to the ray tracing performance of the PlayStation 5 Pro at peak. Factoring in AMD FSR 4 support, the handheld should be able to run patched games at around the PlayStation 5 level of performance, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver mode</a> level with unpatched games. With the faster RDNA5 CUs, which are between 40% and 50% faster than RDNA 3.5 CUs and 60% more bandwidth, the system should also comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>With the specs on hand, MLiD also made some estimations on how much the PlayStation 6 handheld should cost to produce and its final price, which is estimated to be between $399-499, based on the better yields of the TSMC 3nm node, the cost of RAM, compared to previous generation, and the fact that Sony seems to always launch hardware at a loss, although if the estimated costs are correct, Sony would be able to take a small profit even at $399.</p>

<p>As production and release of the PlayStation 6 handheld are expected in 2027, it may be a while until we hear more about the system. Still, we will keep you updated on it as soon as anything comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
