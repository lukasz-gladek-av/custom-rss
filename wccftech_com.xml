			<p>Japanese developer PlatinumGames went through a rough patch with the launch of Babylon's Fall. The game published by Square Enix was the studio's first attempt at a live service title and it failed spectacularly, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite a potentially intriguing setting, the execution was severely lacking, leading to poor critic reviews and <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-reaches-zero-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely low player numbers</a>. Francesco De Meo opined that a lot of the problems <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-babylons-fall-truly-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do with monetization</a>:</p>
<p><em>Where the monetization, Battle Passes, and GaaS features have impacted the game the most, in my opinion, is where it mattered the most in a PlatinumGames action title: combat mechanics. At the end of the main campaign, it becomes possible to change each weapon's attack mode to Power and Technical Mode, with the latter essentially making the game feel more in line with other, better games by PlatinumGames. Additional mechanics unlocked during the campaign itself, such as elemental attacks and properties and the Gideon Coffin mechanics, also make combat considerably more fun than at the start of the campaign. Later quests also feature a much better design, with different traps, light platforming, and more varied combat scenarios. Also, the endgame, although not much different in terms of game flow from the main campaign, is considerably more fun than the base campaign, and it is much easier to find players for stuff like Sieges and so on, better executing the multiplayer action game premise of the experience.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that it is clear that all these features and mechanics have been held back on purpose only to retain players and potentially make them buy future Battle Passes and premium currency. If the best-designed quests and advanced game mechanics would have been made available earlier, would the game have been received slightly better? I definitely think so. The game wouldn't have scored 7s or 8s all around, no question about it, but more reasonable 5s and 6s.</em></p>
<p>Babylon's Fall live servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went down for good</a> on February 27, 2023, less than a year after the game's launch. However, the Japanese developer still plans to work in the live service genre. As first <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/platinumgames-new-online-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by TechGamers</a>, they are <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/platinumgames/jobs/1-01-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> a Game Designer whose desired skills must include 'Experience working on online action game development' and 'Experience in level design for online or open field games'. Of course, it is possible that the studio would use Babylon's Fall learnings to make a much better live service product this time. At this stage, it is unclear whether this will be self-published or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on the single player action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which will be released later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/">Larian Studios</a> boss Swen Vincke shared some of his thoughts on generative AI technology in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">GameSpot</a>. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/">other major creators</a> are concerned the technology could eventually replace humans, Vincke doesn't necessarily share that concern.</p>
<p>It's not that Vincke is entirely against using AI and even generative AI in development for Larian Studios. He understands that it could eventually make a developer's work go faster, but he stops short of saying that it would actually make developing a game take less time.</p>
<p>"<em>I think the naive thing is to think that it will shorten them [development times]. I think that it's an age old truth, if you give a developer two years, they're going to take three. The same thing will be the case here, with what you're going to give them in terms of abilities to do stuff . If they have the ability to do things faster, they'll just do more, which is actually what you want.</em>"</p>
<p>But when it comes to the question of humans being replaced by generative AI technology just generating whole sections of games or entire games even to ship, Vincke doesn't think that'll happen. Nor does he think it's advisable to operate in that way, where generative AI is doing everything for you.</p>
<p>"<em>I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because that is what's going to be available to everybody, right,</em>" Vincke said.</p>
<p>"<em>If the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody, fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still going to want to create something special on top of that. I think that's where teams like us will make a difference, we're a very boutique team. We're actually crafting the situations and the flow of the story by hand, it's a thing that we do.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>When we talk to people about it, this is always the discussion. 'Oh my god, our jobs are going to disappear,' and, no, but you're just going to work differently, potentially. But you're still going to be making a difference</em>."</p>
