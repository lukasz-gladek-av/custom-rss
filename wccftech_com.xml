			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in several interviews this week. Firstly, he joined Fallout TV creator Jonathan Nolan on a panel at the Paley International Council Summit. During the conversation, the head of the Microsoft Gaming division <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-benefited-from-not-launching-with-a-new-game-says-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not having a new Fallout game ready for the show's launch was actually beneficial.</p>
<p>The executive then stopped by Bloomberg's New York City office for another interview. As reported yesterday, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> there is effectively no limit to porting Xbox games to other consoles following the launches of Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, and the announcement of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. He also confirmed the existence of an Xbox handheld project (which, however, will take years to complete) and suggested more acquisitions might be possible, especially if it is an Asian developer.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg interview</a>, Spencer gave a subtle dig at Sony's controversial pricing of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>, saying the market won't grow with consoles that cost $1K.</p>
<p><em>I feel pretty good about where this industry is going. To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.</em></p>
<p>The basic PS5 Pro costs $699, but if you add the optional vertical stand and the disc drive, the price increases to over $800. That's twice as much as the launch price of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony's previous mid-generation console refresh. The PS4 Pro included a disc drive (but not a vertical stand).</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't mentioned anything about a mid-generation console refresh for the Xbox Series S|X. They did it for the Xbox One, of course; the Xbox One X launched a year after PS4 Pro, offering far better hardware at a slightly higher price ($499). Microsoft probably calculated that due to the rising manufacturing costs, it would have to offer a console with similar, if not even higher, pricing than the PS5 Pro and decided it wouldn't be a good idea to launch such a console on the market.</p>
<p>Besides, Microsoft isn't really focused that much on consoles anymore. While they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a next-generation console delivering the biggest leap ever (likely with the help of machine learning), their real approach is fully multiplatform, as evidenced by the push on cloud and other consoles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil 2 Remake Is Coming To iPhone 15 Pro, Entire iPhone 16 Lineup On December 10, With Compatibility For Select iPads and Macs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-2-remake-is-coming-to-iphone-15-pro-entire-iphone-16-lineup-on-december-10-with-compatibility-for-select-ipads-and-macs.1035558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest models of the iPhone are pretty capable when it comes to handling high-end games, and developers are working to take full advantage of Apple's A17 Pro and A18 Pro chips. We are now hearing that Capcom is readying its Resident Evil 2 remake for the iPhone and iPad, with the release date set for December 10, possibly a day after the company releases iOS 18.2 to the public.</p>

<p>To be precise, it will be Capcom's fourth Resident Evil game for the iPhone and iPad and only one of the few AAA games you can play on your iOS or iPadOS device. When Apple announced on stage that it would bring PC games to the iPhone, people presumed that the company would port the titles to a more handheld version. However, the capability of the iPhone's latest chips has proved to be more significant than we previously expected.</p>
<p>The company released a full-fledged version of the PC game for the iPhone and not a stripped-down 'lite' version. The games were brought to the mobile experience without any cuts or edits, and they remained the same as they were on PCs or consoles. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-a17-pro-gpu-features-ray-tracing-metalfx-upscaling-resident-evil-iv-remake-village-assassins-creed-mirage-coming-to-iphones/">Assasin's Creed Mirage</a> was another title that made headlines when the company offered it on the iPhone with full controller support and stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil 2 remake will be released on iPhone on December 10. At this stage, the company did not mention how much the game would cost, but it did say that it would be just like other titles. You will be able to download the game free from the App Store and play the trial version absolutely free of charge. If you wish to continue playing and move out of the demo version, you must buy the full game.</p>
<p>If we presume that Capcom remains true to its words, we can expect the price of the Resident Evil 2 remake to be between $19.99 and 59.99, similar to its existing titles. If you are excited to play the popular title on your mobile device, it is worth noting that only the latest iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models will be compatible, along with last year's iPhone 15 Pro models with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ipad-mini-7-decent-gaming-tablet-for-running-resident-evil-4-remake/">A17 Pro chip</a>. If you have a compatible iPad or Mac, you will still be able to enjoy the game and make use of cross-progression to continue where you left off on another device.</p>
<p>You can register for Resident Evil 2 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432">App Store</a> right now. We will let you guys know when the title hits the App Store. We will be covering the performance of the game on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so be sure to keep an eye out.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-dont-sleep-on-the-fight-wisely-auto-battle-option/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-%E2%80%93-don%E2%80%99t-sleep-on-the-%E2%80%9Cfight-wisely%E2%80%9D-auto-battle-option.1035534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-dont-sleep-on-the-fight-wisely-auto-battle-option/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the original release of the fourth entry in the series, the Dragon Quest franchise has featured some auto-battle options that let the AI take control of party members and fight enemies in place of the player. While the AI programming has always been on the simple side, it has always worked surprisingly well, so much so that auto-battle options were later implemented in the remakes of the first three entries in the series, working as nicely as they did in the games that were developed with the feature in mind.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> unsurprisingly features some auto-battle options called Tactics that allow the player to focus on following the story and exploring the world and let the AI handle the fighting. While some players may scoff at the idea of using auto-battle options, you should definitely not sleep on them in the game, especially the Fight Wisely option, as using it can increase your enjoyment of the experience.</p>
<p>Unlike other remakes of older JRPGs, which tone down the encounter rate to offer a more welcoming experience, <a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> doesn't do anything of the sort, only allowing players to manipulate the encounter rate by using items and abilities that are not immediately available at the start of the game. This means that most of the time, you will be fighting a lot of enemies as you go on about the Hero's journey to save the world.</p>
<p>After a while, fighting so many enemies just to get from one point to another of the map can get quite tiresome, even though the high encounter rate is a core part of the Dragon Quest experience design. However, this becomes less of an issue if you use the Tactics options appropriately in fights against mobs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241113235733_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fight Wisely option, in particular, is a great auto-battle option and the best to use against mobs in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for a few reasons. In the vast majority of cases, this option truly picks the best possible combat options for both offense and defense, prioritizing taking down the most powerful enemies and groups while also handling healing and support surprisingly well. Few have been cases in my current playthrough where the AI hasn't made the same decisions I would have made, with only some small exceptions, such as making my Priest use an offensive spell when a single enemy was left that could have been taken down with weapons. This effectively saved me a lot of time in mob fights, improving combat pacing a lot and making the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Saving time in battles isn't the only reason you should use the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Another very good reason is that the AI controlling your characters essentially cheats against the enemies. For example, it handles healing in a way the player never would, healing characters that get at low health unpredictably, something that a human player could never do, also using items when magic spells are not available. In addition, the AI always selects the element an enemy is weak against, and it is also capable of attacking the reinforcements that some enemies call during battle, which is something that is extremely useful against enemies that call healers as backups, such as Healslimes.</p>
<p>Everything considered, you really shouldn't sleep on the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. While not the absolute best choice for bosses, where you want to have full control of your characters, it is a more than viable option to improve your experience and make the high encounter rate less of an issue.</p>

			<p>Blizzard hosted the Warcraft 30th anniversary livestream a few hours ago, revealing a boatload of information on the franchise's portfolio. Let's start with the original real-time strategy trilogy because Warcraft III Reforged 2.0 is live now, bringing a wealth of visual improvement. To begin with, the developers introduced high-definition versions of the Classic Units, Buildings, VFX, Heroes, Environments, and Icons while allowing players complete freedom to customize between Reforged and Classic HD assets. Moreover, the environments have been improved, ambient lighting has been enhanced, the tone map has been updated, and the bloom removed.</p>
<p>The patch also introduces XP and leveling for Ranked Play multiplayer matches. The leaderboard is based on the amount of XP; if players have the same XP rank, the tiebreaker will be MMR. Level and XP will be reset with each season.</p>
<p>Blizzard also launched the remasters of Warcraft I and II. Players will have the option to switch in real time between the remastered and vanilla graphics. Warcraft I also received a few quality-of-life control improvements, such as faster game speed and right-click to move. Both titles got user interface improvements. Fans can now purchase the updated Warcraft Battle Chest <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest?p=1863680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Battle.net</a> featuring all three remastered games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct: Celebrations, Reflections, and a Look Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rEfOTxr59o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard briefly touched upon <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-rumble-launches-november-3-pre-registration-is-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft Rumble</a>, too. Since its launch in November 2023, the tower defense/action strategy game saw players beat over 900 million bosses. The development team also announced that the game is coming to PC, with a beta scheduled for December 10.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, there were a bunch of World of Warcraft announcements. The highlight was easily the news that player housing will, at long last, be added to the next expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight. The game was the only big MMORPG to lack housing, so its many fans will undoubtedly be delighted.</p>
<p>As for the content updates scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a>, Siren Isle, currently being tested on the PTR, will drop on December 17 on live servers. There will be a new outdoor environment to explore. The World of Warcraft team also shared a detailed roadmap for what's next, starting with the goblin city of Undermine.</p>

<h2>Aloft, a co-op survival game, is set to launch in January 2025 in Early Access mode and currently offers a free demo on Steam</h2>
<p>Aloft, a co-op sandbox survival game developed by Astrolabe Interactive, will enter Early Access mode on January 15, 2025. The game will be published by Funcom and feature both single-player and online co-op modes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Aloft is an indie title that brings the elements such as building, crafting, and surviving together in a world of floating islands. By equipping the players with the ability to build an island into a skyship, the game takes a unique route toward the crafting and survival genre. With lots of side quests, which include stuff like finding lost knowledge, curing fungal corruption, and restoring the ecosystem, Aloft brings interesting gameplay and mechanics.</p>
<p>The game has been in development since 2021 by a dev team comprising 15+ members who have been active in various game projects. While all the content of Aloft will be available on 15th January, the Free Demo is currently available for the players. The demo was launched in 2022 and since then, the dev team has been working on the updates by taking user feedback into consideration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Aloft will be in early access mode for about a year but will continue to receive updates throughout this period. After the game exits early access mode, the dev team will launch the full version and introduce a lot of new content. This will include newer mechanics, more explorable biomes, meteorological events, and much more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In the early access mode, players will have access to crafting and building across three diverse explorable biomes. Aloft will have both single-player and multi-player modes with private and public lobbies as well. There will be a lot of things to do in the game apart from crafting and building, such as skyship sailing, gliding, farming, and cooking.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Aloft – Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMpbOiQcW4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As per the official announcement, the game's price will likely increase with the official launch. Right now, the game has been wish-listed over 30,000 times and has received a lot of positive feedback via demo gameplay.</p>
