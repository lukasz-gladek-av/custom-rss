			<p>Bethesda Game Studios' Head and game director for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series (as well as Starfield), Todd Howard, recently chimed in on the hottest topic across most industries: the usage of AI.</p>



<p><span>Eurogamer<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games" target="_blank"> interviewed Howard</a></span> during a preview event for the second season of Fallout's Amazon Prime Video show, which starts airing on Wednesday, December 17. On that occasion, the veteran developer mused that AI is effectively a tool that can make development go faster, but it won't replace the human intention, which is what really makes Bethesda's games (and great games in general) special. </p>



<p><em>I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one. But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things.</em></p>



<p><em>I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop. That's our view on it. But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.</em></p>



<p>It's a similar view to that of fellow games industry legend Hideo Kojima, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to consider AI as a 'friend' that could perform tedious tasks, thereby boosting efficiency, while he and the rest of his team at Kojima Productions focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p>Efficiency is definitely among the top priorities of large, triple-A game developers and publishers nowadays. With the continuous rise of budgets, AI is seen as an essential tool to reduce costs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that efficiency, expansion, and transformation are the three key areas of innovation that AI amplifies. However, as noted by Todd Howard, its application cannot come at the expense of human creativity. </p>



<p>As a side note, Eurogamer also asked Howard about his game of the year, and the Elder Scrolls and Fallout director joined the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chorus of creatives and executives who voted for Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>

			<p>Following <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">its release earlier this year</a></strong>, the Nintendo Switch 2 has received multiple system updates that introduced new features to the system, improved backward compatibility with select original Switch titles, enhanced the system's stability for a better user experience and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-fixes-frustrating-bluetooth-issue-and-more/"><strong>fixed some critical issues</strong></a>. Today, the Japanese company started the December system update cycle with a new update that also launched for the original Switch.</p>



<p>The 21.1.0 system update for both systems is a minor system update that introduces <em>"<strong><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473#current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience,"</a></strong> </em>so all those expecting a major new feature, such as Home Menu themes, will be disappointed. The new update will be automatically downloaded and installed by both systems when connected online.</p>



<p>While the new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is still being examined by datamining experts such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OatmealDome</strong></a> to reveal all undocumented changes, Nintendo itself has confirmed that the new update fixes an issue that caused video playback in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to malfunction, a change not listed in the official update notes. We will update this post if any further undocumented change is discovered in the coming days.</p>
