			<p>NetEase has announced that the popular free-to-play team-based 6v6 third-person online action game Marvel Rivals is getting its first PvE mode on October 23. It will be inspired by Marvel Zombies, the four-episode adult animated television miniseries released on September 24 via Disney+.</p>



<p>The announcement came with a brief video where Marvel Games Executive Producer Danny Koo explained:</p>



<p><em>In this Marvel Zombies inspired mode, you get to play as Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher, taking on endless waves of zombies. You'll have to survive the Horde, go toe-to-toe with zombie Namor and the Queen of the Dead as bosses and fight to save the world from getting totally zombified. We have also given each hero some unique abilities. Charge through the hordes as Jeff, slice and dice with Blade's bouncing Moon Blades, shock zombies with Thor in his persistent Awakened state. Or go berserk as Magik in her unlimited Darkchild form. Showcase your epic combat skills against the zombie swarms and tough bosses.</em></p>

<p>More details are yet to come, such as when this limited-time event will end.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-launches-next-week-daredevil-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently up to its Season 4.5 'Heart of the Dragon'</a>, which launched last week and delivered the long-requested cross-platform progression feature. Moreover, it introduced Daredevil as the 43rd playable character. In the game, Daredevil is a combo-oriented Duelist (the archetype for high-damage characters) with plenty of mobility. The character also has a team-up ability with The Punisher.</p>

			<p>Thanks to Sony and PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">lawsuit against Tencent over Horizon knock-off, Light of Motiram</a>, we have an update for the previously confirmed Horizon Zero Dawn movie that's in the works. First reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">The Game Post</a>, the movie is set to start filming sometime in 2026, and is intended to be out in theatres the following year, in 2027.</p>



<p>The confirmation came as part of the sworn declaration from Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, the branch Sony opened specifically for its film and TV collaborations and adaptations. According to Qizilbash, there's already a script in place, and PlayStation Productions is currently looking for a director.</p>



<p>"<em>We are in development for a film based on Horizon in partnership with Columbia Pictures</em>. <em>We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film Uncharted and the 2023 film Gran Turismo</em>," Qizilbash writes in his declaration, per The Game Post.</p>



<p>Initially, PlayStation's adaptation of Horizon was intended to be a TV series produced in collaboration with Netflix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/">though those plans were scrapped this past April</a> in favour of making a movie instead. Since the film still doesn't have a director attached to it, we're still a ways out from hearing about any casting decisions or ideas around what the film will cover.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see who PlayStation Productions is able to find to direct, and then where the search for who will play Aloy ends up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Days after Battlefield 6 went live, while EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">were enjoying watching sales numbers go up</a>, and players were still having a good time amid the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">myriad of issues cropping up for PC players</a>, one element of the game became clear to everyone playing. It took far too long to level up and unlock weapons and attachments in the current progression and XP system.</p>



<p>In response, players found a way to farm XP by jumping into Portal and creating Bot-filled matches where you could level up extremely quickly. EA responded <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">by trying to play whack-a-mole with these XP farms</a>, shutting some of the most popular ones down, but more bot server-moles kept appearing until Portal's server capacity was at its max.</p>



<p>Now, in a new <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">Community Update post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios are trying a slightly different approach, one that's arguably what they should have tried doing in the first place. On the one hand, it is still clamping down on XP farms. On the other hand, the amount of XP you'll gain through regular matches and daily bonuses is going up, and the requirements for unlocking the first 20 attachment ranks are going down. Assignments that previously required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 are also being reduced to only require ranks 10, 15, and 20.</p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression, especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets and weapon attachments</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield</em>."</p>



<p>The update listed three changes that Battlefield Studios will implement sometime within the next week: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively</em>.</li>



<li><em>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you'll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast</em>.</li>



<li><em>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively</em>.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to XP farms in Portal and how Battlefield Studios and EA are actually addressing it, the studio wrote, "<em>We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>All of these updates, as previously mentioned, will be implemented in the game at some point in the next week, though Battlefield Studios says several times in its full post that these changes will require further tweaking and adjustments over time, so nothing will be set in stone once the updates are live. Also, when the update for Portal goes live, Battlefield Studios expects that "<em>all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server</em>."</p>



<p>It's good that EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to address the root problem with progression and adjust it to make it feel like less of a slog instead of only trying to further clamp down on XP farms. Hopefully these changes are at least meaningful enough to start that the early experience for players is improved.</p>
