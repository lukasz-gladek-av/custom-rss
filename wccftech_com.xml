			<p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to dataminer PlayStation Game Size</a> (@PlaystationSize on X), <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> has just added title IDs for <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> on Sony's <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>, possibly hinting at pre-orders opening in the near future:</p>



<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database. I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders.</em></p>



<p>When asked how long it usually takes between the time when title IDs first appear on the store and the actual reveal of the pricing information, the dataminer replied:</p>



<p><em>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it's not something I know for sure. But I don't think there's going to be a long wait.</em></p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size <strong>regularly scrapes the PlayStation Store database</strong> searching for news and details about upcoming games. They'd previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launch-date-possibly-leaked-via-ps-store-db/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered the placeholder date for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong></a>, September 30, 2022, which had been entered into the PlayStation Store, and it turned out to be not far from the actual release date, <strong>November 11, 2022</strong>. More recently, they were behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original discovery of the native Kingdom Come: Deliverance PlayStation 5 version</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The fact that Rockstar Games has started doing preparatory work on Grand Theft Auto VI's store page will undoubtedly reinvigorate the hopes of fans, who are eager to see the studio confirm the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Nov</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">mber 19, 2026 date</a></strong>. There have already been two delays, after all, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a></strong>, and then again to November. <strong>Rockstar has never delayed any of its games three times</strong>, but there's a first time for everything.</p>



<p>As much as people are waiting to see if it actually releases this year, <strong>there's almost the same level of anticipation to discover the game's price</strong>. Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a tremor throughout the industry</a> when he claimed Rockstar (and publisher <strong>Take-Two</strong>) could get away with launching a base game at <strong>$100</strong> for the first time in history. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-should-cost-70-achieve-maximum-sales-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Rockstar developers</a> believe it will still be priced at <strong>$70</strong>, especially because <strong>a lower price opens up the true goldmine - the online mode - to more players</strong>.</p>



<p>There's still a lot we have to learn about Grand Theft Auto VI, though we do know, based on what a veteran developer has heard and revealed to Wccftech, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the online mode could feel a bit like an MMO</a></strong>.</p>
