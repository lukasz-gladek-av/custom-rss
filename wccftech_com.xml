			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developer The Chinese Room has been hit with layoffs, confirmed the game's publisher, Paradox Interactive. It's unclear how many developers have been impacted, though Paradox claims that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 "<em>is unaffected</em>" by the cuts.</p>
<p>The first reports of the layoffs came from now-former developers at The Chinese Room, who took to LinkedIn to announce that they had lost their jobs. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, one employee wrote, "<em>We are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around</em>." At least nine former employees have confirmed they were laid off, though the total number of cuts remains unknown.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn posts and Game Developer's report, Paradox Interactive confirmed the layoffs to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PC Gamer</a>, with a statement that reads "<em>Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release. We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors</em>."</p>
<p>It's no secret that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been through the wringer, so to speak, as we've been waiting on this game since it was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">2019</a>. It was also at risk of being canceled at least once before, when it was being developed by Hardsuit Labs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room took over development in 2021, and has been picking up where Hardsuit Labs left off while also developing its own titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>. These layoffs are the latest event in the long development journey that Bloodlines 2 has gone through.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/">Earlier this year,</a> Paradox Interactive confirmed that Bloodlines 2 is due for an October release date, though a specific release date has yet to be provided. According to Paradox, the game is "<em>done</em>," and the studio is working on polishing it and squashing every bug it can up to its October date. After all this time, seeing what arrives when Bloodlines 2 is out and on shelves will be interesting. Hopefully, it's a triumphant return for the series and the game that fans have been waiting for.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive and Anshar Studios have announced the release date for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painkiller remake.</a> This 'modern reimagining' of the classic 2004 first-person shooter game from People Can Fly will be available on October 9 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now on all storefronts. The Standard Edition of Painkiller can be purchased digitally for $39.99. It includes the “Iron Crusade” skin pack, which features skins for all four playable characters — Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch — as well as skins for six weapons: the Electrodriver, Stakegun, Shotgun, SMG, Hand Cannon, and Rocket Launcher. Pre-orders of the Standard Edition on consoles will come with the “Burnished Pride” retail-exclusive weapons pack, which includes additional gold skins for the aforementioned six weapons. The Deluxe Edition of Painkiller is priced at $49.99. It comes with the “Iron Crusade” pre-order bonus skin pack and three additional post-launch DLCs, each including six weapon skins and four character skins.</p>

<p>Just like in the original Painkiller, the player character is sentenced to Purgatory for crimes against Heaven. However, the Voice of the Creator gives them one last chance at redemption: blasting through hordes of demons in brutal, fast-paced combat using an array of infernal weapons. Players will fight their way through gruesome, gothic environments to stop Azazel, the fallen angel, from invading Earth, and earn salvation – either alone or with up to two other players in online co-op mode, which is a change from the original, a single player-only experience.</p>
<p>There will be lots of traversal options, such as jump, grappling hook, and dash, for players as they traverse the vast landscapes. They'll face grotesque terrors that range from hordes of demons to titanic terrors such as the monstrous offspring of Azazel, the Nephilim. Character progression sees tarot cards used to upgrade the player character's abilities. Each playable character has unique perks to boost energy, health, power, and damage.</p>
