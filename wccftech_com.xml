			<p><span>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-mind-blowing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V mod</a> released this week introduces an extremely accurate recreation of GTA IV's Liberty City, complete with all the elements that make it feel like a living, breathing city.</span></p>
<p>The Liberty City Preservation Project isn't the first modding project that attempts to recreate Liberty City in the latest main entry in the series, but it's definitely the most accomplished, as the recreated map features NPCs, vehicles, and sound effects from the original game. In addition, the recreated city also features a fully functional subway system, map, radar, and radio stations. As if all this wasn't enough, the mod also supports an HD texture pack that improves the visual quality of the map and makes it almost feel like the proper Grand Theft Auto IV remaster that has yet to be released. You can check out the mod in action in the trailer below.</p>

<p>The first release of the Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project is only the beginning for the development team. As revealed in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/how-world-travel-created-the-liberty-city-preservation-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Intel</a>, the team is looking to restore the majority of the interiors to be identical to those in GTA IV, destructible props, and completely redo the entire maps vertex paintings to make them look even better in Grand Theft Auto V. Once the project is done, the team is also looking to start a similar one, so there may be some amazing recreations of older games' maps in the future.</p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project mod can be downloaded from the modding project's official <a href="https://discord.gg/worldtravel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server.</a></p>
