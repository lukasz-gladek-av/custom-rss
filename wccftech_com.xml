			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 MicroSD Express to M.2 open-source adapter is in the works, potentially allowing users to get more storage space at a lower price.</p>
<p>The project's <a href="https://github.com/NVNTLabs/switch2-SDEX2M2/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, which was launched this week, provided the first information on the process, revealing that such an adapter is made possible because the console's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and utilizes the NVMe protocol for communication. As such, the adapter maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2’s MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD, and no protocol translation is required as the Nintendo Switch 2 host controller handles everything.</p>
<p>Currently, the project's development seems to be proceeding smoothly, and the team is actively developing the PCB layout and testing. While the adapter, on paper, should be working without any issue, the team warns that there's the possibility of power-related issues related to the power draw of the M.2 SSD, which could be more than the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle, so a basic level of power filter has been added to hopefully establish a connection. Still, it is advised only to use low-voltage M.2 2230 NVMe drives and not attempt to use the adapter on legacy MicroSD slots, such as those of the original Nintendo Switch systems.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 will not be remembered as an innovative gaming system, it is an excellent console and a clear upgrade from its predecessor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main advancements of the Nintendo Switch 2 is its support for High Dynamic Range displays. This works in both handheld mode, thanks to the console's own display, and TV mode, when the console is connected to an external display.</p>
<p>Granted, the console's display was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> to be severely lacking in HDR capabilities. The edge-lit LCD can only output 450 nits at maximum, which is nowhere near what's needed to display a proper HDR image. Moreover, being an LCD, the Nintendo Switch 2 display cannot provide anywhere near the same contrast level as an OLED display.</p>
<p>This limitation will only be overcome when the inevitable OLED Switch 2 releases in the future. Meanwhile, users can still access a better HDR experience in TV mode, provided they have a capable HDR display. However, Nintendo's HDR calibration settings menu isn't exactly user friendly.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFXc_iKIMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> out by YouTuber My Life in Gaming, after adjusting the peak brightness setting, there is another prompt that can be triggered with the Y button that brings the user to another brightness slider. This is, however, the paper white slider, which is completely different than the peak brightness slider, as HDR-savvy users already know.</p>
<p>As such, if your HDR is overblown, tweaking this setting may help. The YouTuber brought the slider below the midpoint and noticed improvements in midtones, shadows, and even menus with HDR enabled in Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hidden Switch 2 Setting Fixes HDR Calibration! / MY LIFE IN GAMING" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhFXc_iKIMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another 'tip' is that you should always enable HGIG in your display's options. The HDR Gaming Interest Group was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr-gaming-interest-group-formed-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> nearly seven years ago to optimize HDR gaming content across various displays. When HGIG is enabled, a display's dynamic tone mapping is disabled, preserving the creator's intent and delivering an optimal HDR image.</p>
<p>Granted, even with these two tweaks, Nintendo's first-party games don't look that much better in HDR on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's clear they still have to learn how to optimize their games for the format. Still, you'll get the optimal HDR image for third-party games.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will launch later this month, introducing returning monster Lagiacrus, new features, and balance changes to the game.</p>
<p>The game's second major update has yet to receive a precise launch date, but it's been confirmed on the game's official Japanese X account that it will be released at the end of June. Full patch notes will be coming closer to the update's launch, but we already know the update will introduce Monster Hunter Tri's beloved monster Lagiacrus, which is expected to be somewhat reworked like it was in Generations due to the lack of underwater combat, a layered weapon system and some balance changes for specific weapons, including hammer and dual blades.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched earlier this year on PC and consoles, and has definitely moved the series' formula forward by introducing some open-world mechanics that allow hunters to always stay out in the field and go after the monsters that appear on the maps as time passes. You can check out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review</a> to learn why I think the latest entry in the series is one of the best Monster Hunter games to date.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Independent developer VOID Interactive announced the console launch date for its tactical first-person shooter game Ready or Not. The game will debut on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>&nbsp;and Xbox Series S|X on July 15 in three editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game</li>
<li>Day One Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>

</ul>
<p>The Dark Waters DLC and Home Invasion DLC are also available for separate purchase at $9.99 / £7.99 / €9.99 each.</p>
<p>Chris Stone, Studio General Manager at VOID Interactive, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a major milestone for everyone involved in the development of Ready or Not, from our initial development phase, to early access days, through to PC 1.0 and now consoles. Our amazing community has played a pivotal role in helping us shape this next chapter for Ready or Not and we wouldn’t be here without their valued feedback at all stages of development. We can’t wait to welcome our brand new console audience to Los Suenos and to share in their excitement this summer.</em></p>
<p>The console versions come with 18 single player or co-op missions (up to five players) and 2 new missions as part of the Los Sueños Stories free DLC update that will be released for free on PC on the same day. The Dark Waters and Home Invasion DLC bring 6 additional levels, and in Dark Waters DLC, there's also the UH-60 support Helicopter.</p>

<p>The game was in early access on PC for several years. It finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> its full launch in December 2023. As of last month, Ready or Not had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over nine million units to date. Needless to say, VOID Interactive is looking to break that ten million milestone with the help of console gamers.</p>
