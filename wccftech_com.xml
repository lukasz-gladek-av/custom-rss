            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the PS5 has been raised outside the United States twice now, first in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">2022</a> and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a month ago</a>, but US consumers might not be out of the woods on a PS5 price increase just yet.</p>
<p>During its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-77-8-million-units-shipped-sony-forecasts-further-decrease-in-unit-sales-for-fy2025/">financial forecasting call for the coming year</a>, Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">confirmed</a> that the company has been considering "<em>passing on</em>" the <strong>100 billion yen</strong> hit that Sony expects to take due to the United States' tariffs on to its US customers.</p>
<p>Sony president and chief executive officer Hiroki Totoki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-considers-further-price-rises-as-it-braces-for-500m-tariffs-impact">confirmed</a> that the company is considering moving some PS5 manufacturing to the US, saying, "<em>Hardware can of course be produced locally, I think that would be an efficient strategy. PS5 is being manufactured in many areas, whether it is going to be manufactured in the US or not - it needs to be considered going forward.</em>"</p>
<p>While the US has been able to miss out on price increases for the PS5 console so far, it hasn't missed out on increases to the games and to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/">PlayStation's PS Plus subscription service</a>. In fact, US PlayStation players should also expect another PS Plus price increase, as regions outside the US got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">another price hike last month</a>.</p>
<p>It's possible that PlayStation chooses to take an easy competitive win compared to Xbox by keeping its console prices the same instead of raising them, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Xbox recently did</a>. Though, as Circana executive director and video game industry analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lp4wimyhfc2l">Mat Piscatella points out</a>, the current reality is that no one knows exactly what their next move will be.</p>
<p>Like Nintendo and every other manufacturer in the video game industry, Sony has multiple plans ready to execute, depending on how the tariff situation gets resolved. Microsoft has clearly made its choice for now, but everyone else is still holding their breath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PS5 has reached 77.8 million units sold worldwide, and by that count, the console is still 1.2 million units behind the PS4, five years into its lifecycle. This is the only console generation where we are this deep in, and the prices of major consoles have gone up, instead of down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-3-crimson-remake-download/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-3-crimson-impressive-overhaul/">Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod</a> is now available for download, introducing so many improvements and new features that wouldn't look amiss in a real remake.</p>
<p>The mod, which is only compatible with the HD Collection version and can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycryhdcollection/mods/272?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://github.com/berthrage/Devil-May-Cry-3-Crimson/releases/tag/V0.3">GitHub</a>, allows players to enjoy the third entry in the series with plenty of new features and enhancements, including a new HUB based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">Devil May Cry 5</a> interface, updated lock-on and camera options that provide a much better view of the action, local co-op with plenty of options for an optimal experience, on-the-fly style switching, which is only available officially in the Nintendo Switch release of the HD remaster and more.</p>
<p>It's gameplay options, other than on-the-fly style switching, however, that make Devil May Cry 3 Crimson feel the most like a proper remake. Features like third-person camera, inertia and guardfly in the vein of Devil May Cry 4, a fully functional weapon wheel for improved weapon switching, reduced input lag and new gameplay modes like the Legendary Dark Knight and Must-Style modes are incredible additions that make the game feel and play more like the most recent entries in the series, turning the already excellent original into an even better game. You can check out some of these features in action in the launch trailer below.</p>

<p>The Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod will have to make do for the time being for fans of the series eagerly anticipating to learn what's next for the series. Though long-time series director Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">left CAPCOM last year</a>, the future of the franchise could still be bright, as series creator Hideki Kamiya is working with the Japanese publisher again, and has recently expressed the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-is-once-again-letting-capcom-and-everyone-else-know-that-he-would-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry/">remake the first entry in the series.</a></p>
