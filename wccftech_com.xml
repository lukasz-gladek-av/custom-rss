			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>
