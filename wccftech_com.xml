			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is practically indestructible, at least according to YouTuber JerryRigEverything, who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9jEYO2oaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> took it upon himself</a> to smash it 50 times with pliers and noticed it still worked. The YouTuber even removed the external plastic layer before attempting this test, which means in reality it's going to be even more resistant to hits of any kind.</p>
<p>Here's the quote from his video:</p>
<p><em>We did remove the plastic screen protector from earlier, and the only way to truly tell if the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is going to scatter into bits if we shatter it is if we shatter it! After 13 hits, the Joy-Cons pop off, and I'm starting to think there isn't any glass and the whole thing is shatterproof plastic. Another 14 very solid hits, and the Switch 2 is shockingly still alive.&nbsp; 15 more and still nothing! This is wild. If watching this doesn't give you confidence&nbsp; in the Switch 2's durability, nothing will. Only after 50 hits from my ridiculously large&nbsp; pliers do we see that indeed there is a thin layer of glass on the surface, and as you can see from the slow motion, Nintendo was right and it does indeed explode into little needle-like shards of glass without that laminate top layer. So I would definitely leave yours intact and in place. Most of the glass is still glued to the LCD, but there are still plenty of free shards of pulverized glass and dust that could embed themselves into little kids' fingers or eyeballs, so I'm glad that Nintendo has a top layer and nobody should take it off. Even though I did get a black screen of death, after a quick reset, Nintendo says it was just kidding about being game over and is ready to keep on playing. Basically invincible. I'm a big fan of the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is a 7.9 inch (20 cm) edge-lit LCD touchscreen with 1080p resolution (279 ppi), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC powered</a> variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and HDR support (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre</a> due to the display's low peak brightness).</p>
<p>The console is literally flying off the shelves, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Nintendo's previous record with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days on the market, roughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch had sold in the same timeframe.

			<p>Paris-based developer Streum On Studio has <a href="https://x.com/StreumOnStudio/status/1933543316076830784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split</a> from fellow French publisher Focus Entertainment, becoming independent once again.</p>
<p>Streum On Studio was founded in 2007 by a few developers who had worked together on a Half-Life mod called Syndicate Black Ops. Their first game, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy, launched on July 29, 2011 on PC. It's a first-person action roleplaying game powered by the Source engine and set in a dystopian cyberpunk world based on a private tabletop RPG. In the game, the titular E.Y.E is an armed branch of the Secreta Secretorum that attempts a coup against the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of worlds and planets that rules with an iron fist.</p>
<p>E.Y.E itself is plagued by internal conflict between the Jian and Culter factions, the latter of which is the one the player character belongs to. Their loyalties are torn between their superior, Commander Rimanah, and the Secreta's chief separatist with unstoppable ambition, and the 'Mentor', your friend and instructor. The 'Mentor' tries to unite the two rival factions at all costs. Players are thus thrust into the middle of a fratricidal war fraught with political conspiracies and quests for power, involving different groups and megacorporations.</p>
<p>Following this first release, Streum On Studio turned to Warhammer 40,000 with the first-person shooter&nbsp;<span>games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/space-hulk-deathwing-review-lost-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Hulk: Deathwing</a>, released in 2016, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/necromunda-hired-gun-buggy-trip-underhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necromunda: Hired Gun</a>, which debuted in 2021. Following this latest game launch,</span>&nbsp;Focus Entertainment acquired the studio, but it only lasted four years. Now, the developer has bought back its shares to return to independence.</p>
<p><iframe title="STREUMON - UNANNOUNCED TITLE TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTj1cb8_59U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The development team has already teased their next project with a brief trailer we've embedded above. Streum On Studio plans to debut the game's world premiere at some point this Summer; with Summer Game Fest already gone, it appears likely that the announcement will take place at Gamescom, the biggest European gaming event. This year, it's set to take place at the usual venue (Cologne's Koelnmesse) between August 19 and 24.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrj7u74vi22v?ref_src=embed">2025-06-13T19:57:22.329Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>
