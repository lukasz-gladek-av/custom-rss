			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games is no longer launching on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">previously announced Halloween 2025 release date</a>. Instead, we no longer know when it is coming out on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Yacht Club Games announced the delay with <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a blog post on its website</a>, where it held that this would not be "<em>a major delay</em>," and that the team just needs "<em>a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.</p><p>Read the full announcement here➡️<a href="https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs">https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs</a> <a href="https://t.co/WXFqcbUl3x">pic.twitter.com/WXFqcbUl3x</a></p></div>— Yacht Club Games (@YachtClubGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/YachtClubGames/status/1975293906251296964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line</em>," Yacht Club continued. "<em>The game is so close to being done - we're playing it from start to finish every day.</em>"</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest for October 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, but in the most recent Steam Next Fest for the year this past June, Mina the Hollower was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">one of Wccftech's call-outs for what people should spend their time playing while the festival is on</a>.</p>



<p>When we checked out the demo, we wrote, "<em>The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-won-t-affect-every-existing-user/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-reportedly-won%E2%80%99t-affect-every-existing-subscriber.1318786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Game Pass price hike announced on October 1, 2025, reportedly will not affect every existing subscriber when it goes into effect next month.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/">official Xbox Game Pass subreddit</a> earlier today, users shared recent emails informing them of the price increase, noting that some subscriptions will not be affected. Most exempt subscriptions exempt from the automatic increase are for users in European countries like Poland, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7d85l/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7gokr/">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni83ymw/">Italy</a>, and Asian countries like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni8url6/">Indonesia</a>. This is likely due to local laws preventing an automatic price increase without the user's consent, although Microsoft has yet to provide confirmation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Xbox Game Pass subscription service has seen significant changes besides a price increase this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">rearranging subscription tiers into Essential, Premium, and Ultimate</a>. <span>While the Ultimate tier will offer considerable value with the addition of the Ubisoft + Classics library, the Fortnite Crew subscription, and day-one access to Xbox-published games, its steep price increase to $29.99/month wasn't well-received, so much so that the page to&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank">cancel the subscription was briefly overwhelmed.</a></span></p>



<p>Although the Xbox Game Pass service has seen multiple price increases, it will remain a central pillar of Xbox's market strategy. According to Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/">the service is a profitable business</a> that has reached a record high of $5 billion and is becoming more valuable for both users and creators.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Debuts New Animated Short “Close to You” with No Explanation, Speculation Points to Pikmin Tease]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-close-to-you-short-pikmin-super-mario-galaxy-movie-tease-speculation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-debuts-new-animated-short-%E2%80%9Cclose-to-you%E2%80%9D-with-no-explanation-speculation-points-to-pikmin-tease.1318666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Pb2cLqmk4">debuted a new animated short</a> titled "<em>Close to You</em>" with absolutely no explanation as to what it means. The short was simultaneously uploaded to the Nintendo Today app, the company's social media channels, and its YouTube channel, each with nothing more than its title to accompany it.</p>



<p>Of course, wild speculation online immediately followed the video's publishing, with fans going in a few directions based on the video's contents and what seem to be subtle hints regarding what it could mean.</p>



<p>The video itself is a nearly four-minute short of a baby following a magical soother around the room, accompanied by high-quality animation and visual fidelity, and some playful music which fans recognized as music from Pikmin 4. The music, along with the fact that a blurry Pikmin can be seen crossing the background of a shot at one point, has fans pointing to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o0f26r/new_pikmin_teaser/">being a Pikmin-related tease</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Close to you" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_Pb2cLqmk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But is it a tease for an upcoming Pikmin game? Or is it potentially a tease for a different Pikmin project, maybe even a Pikmin film or series? Or what if it's not a Pikmin project, and something else entirely?</p>



<p>It could be, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-posts-mysterious-close-to-you-animated-short-film/">VGC's deputy editor Chris Scullion speculates</a>, a tease at the origin story for Rosalina for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>. Or it's still something entirely different, like potentially a new project featuring baby versions of Nintendo characters, and this is Rosalina, followed by Baby Peach, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and the rest of Nintendo's iconic characters all coming together in either a new game or a new Rugrats-style series featuring the various Nintendo babies.</p>



<p>Your guess is as good as mine or anyone else's at this point. Hopefully, we don't have to wait too long for Nintendo to explain more about "<em>Close to You</em>."</p>
