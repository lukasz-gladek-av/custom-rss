			<p>Ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong>, though we knew we'd get a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/"><strong>unannounced secret game</strong> was also rumoured</a> to be part of the event. Well, the rumours were correct, as that fourth game was revealed to be <strong>Double Fine's</strong> next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/keeper-review-shine-a-light/">Keeper</a></strong>. A "<em>multiplayer pottery party-brawler</em>" called <strong>Kiln</strong>, where you play as a pot looking to smash other pots.</p>



<p>Set to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 sometime in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, Kiln is equal parts "<em>creation and destruction</em>" as it's about building and creating pots with your friends, but also about destroying them and each other for the fun of it in brawling game modes, like its introductory mode, <strong>Quench</strong>.</p>



<p>Kiln begins with you as a small, ghost-like figure that has the ability to mould a more secure, tough body out of clay. That means your time in Kiln begins, well, sitting at a kiln, as you spin and form whatever kind of body you can make for yourself out of clay.</p>



<p>"<em>Making pots in real life is really difficult</em>," says <strong>Derek Brand</strong>, the project lead on Kiln at Double Fine, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">in an Xbox Wire blog post</a>. "<em>It takes a lot of practice, and you can get good at it over time, but it is not an easy thing to just jump into. We wanted to make the pot-making super easy and accessible – it’s just a button and a control stick – and you can make any kind of shape you wanted. We wanted people to immediately feel like they’re masters at this craft.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The kind of pot body you create for yourself will determine what you're able to do when jumping into a brawl with other pots. Everyone gets a basic attack, but pots with different shapes and sizes have different abilities you can lean on to try and ensure you're the one pot left standing without a crack down your side. There are <strong>24 total special attacks</strong> based on the shape and size of the pot you create, meaning there's plenty for you to play around with.</p>



<p>"<em>A little plate which looks like a hockey puck can have a trick shot that will ricochet off multiple enemies. For cup-shaped pots, you have an area-of-effect attack that shoots out popcorn. Or if you make a big cylinder, that can turn into a huge hammer that can slam down and obliterate enemies</em>," the Xbox Wire post explains.</p>

<p>You can also customize your pot far beyond just its shape, with different glazes, finishes, and designs to add, and a whole lobby area where you can practice for future fights, take out pots other players have made for a spin, and a store where you can buy more decorations and designs for your pots called <strong>The Wedge</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we’re thinking about the world, we wanted to really incorporate this element of [an] old, ancient technology and art form that has been around forever; we wanted to really lean on that</em>," said Brand. "<em>You start off in this world of Celadon; she’s this deity of creation and destruction. She embodies both of those things. And you’re this little spirit, this little bodiless floating sprite. But within this world, there are other gods that aren’t around, but they have these little floating islands of their old domains, and each map is based off ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We gave the old gods their own distinct personalities. For example, Hermes has a map set in his shipping facility, where packages are constantly being sent out and treadmills going back and forth shooting packages you’ll have to avoid. Then there’s Dionysus’ map, which is like a Boogie Lounge, which features a dance floor at its center — if you step onto one of the tiles, you’re forced to dance, creating a dynamic battleground where some players are fighting while others end up dancing</em>."</p>

<p>Kiln will have a beta ahead of its launch if you're keen to try it out, with details on when that'll be coming from Double Fine soon. Like every other game included in today's Developer Direct, it'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass right at launch, and playable through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Summer Xbox Game Showcases</strong> usually bring some very interesting, <strong>unexpected announcements</strong> alongside new information on the Xbox blockbusters we have come to know and love over the years. 2025's showcase was no different, as the event introduced us to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong>, an action role-playing game in development by Game Freak, the developer of the Pokémon series.</p>



<p>Although we didn't see much of the game in action in the game's reveal trailer, it was more than enough to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how the game could be a solid action RPG</strong> thanks to its crused protagonist Emma, her canine companion Koo and the verdant world they will have to traverse. And if the game only looked promising, the new look at the game shared during today's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong> has only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reinforced the generally positive opinion </strong>most had about it, with a feel that is markedly <em>NieR</em> in both gameplay and music.</p>



<p>This project represents a massive departure for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Game Freak</strong>, described as a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new challenge"</em> by the studio.  <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-developer-direct/"><strong>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026</strong></a>, the world has been decimated by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Blight</strong>, a parasitic plant that has wiped out most of the population. </p>



<p>Amidst this ravaged world, <strong>warmth, trust, and loneliness</strong> still manage to shine through, personified by <strong>Emma</strong>, a Sealer who is feared and isolated because she can hunt <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Malefacts</strong>, creatures born from the combination of plant and animal, and seal their blight within her own body. <strong>Her design is a direct reflection of this curse</strong>, as her hair functions as a living vine, a core motif that influences both the world’s visual identity and Emma's traversal and combat abilities.</p>



<p>While the game looks <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">visceral and immersive</strong>, Game Freak hasn't completely abandoned its roots. The combat system features <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a blend of high-speed actio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">and strategic command</strong> that doesn't look too different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> series combat system. Emma and Koo have their own <strong>unique abilities</strong> unlocked via dedicated skill trees, and as the bond between them deepens, they unlock more skills to equip as their actions directly influence one another.</p>



<p>In <strong>combat</strong>, once enough power builds up, players can unleash Koo’s attacks via a menu that slows down time, a mechanic that feels like a <strong>clever bridge</strong> from Game Freak’s turn-based history to the action-packed experience of <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>. <strong>Parrying</strong> will also be central to the combat flow, as successful parries allow players to stack beneficial effects via Spirit Stones, rewarding technical execution.</p>



<p>The one feature that seems to stand out, together with the combat mechanics, is <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>'s <strong>atmosphere</strong>. The post-apocalyptic world with a nature flavor, the Golems - the mechanical beings into which humanity transferred its souls that have degraded beyond repair, and the ethereal soundtrack immediately brought the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/"><em>NieR </em>series</a></strong> to mind, in the best possible way.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although there is surely more to see, the care that Game Freak is pouring into the project is setting Emma’s journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation to be one to keep an eye on when the game launches this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>
