			<p>Almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">seven years since its initial reveal</a>, during which time<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> the game was<strong> delayed</strong></a> on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple occasions</a></strong> due in part to developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> deciding to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/">entirely overhaul the direction of the game</a></strong> and what kind of game it would be, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> is finally at the finish line. Pearl Abyss has announced that its upcoming open-world, action-adventure title has <strong>gone gold</strong> ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong>, release date.</p>



<p>The March release date was revealed back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">September 2025</a></strong>, shortly after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">featured at <strong>Gamescom 2025</strong> with a playable demo</a>. But even then, it was tough to think of its March date as a lock, considering the fact that it was also featured at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/">Gamescom 2023</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a></strong>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/">a delay in between</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it's clear now that when Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">confidently claimed in <strong>June 2025</strong> that it wouldn't announce another release date until it was ready to do so,</a> it wasn't bluffing. With the game officially going gold, the studio is finally ready to put a bow on a version of Crimson Desert that it's ready to launch and put in players' hands.</p>



<p>"<em>We&nbsp;sincerely thank&nbsp;our fans around the world for being with us on this meaningful journey</em>," the team writes in a message to players in a press release. "<em>Thanks to your support, we have reached this important milestone. We look forward to welcoming you to the continent of&nbsp;Pywel&nbsp;on March 19</em>."</p>

<p>It's exciting to know that we'll finally get a chance to see the full scale of Crimson Desert, a game that we still have plenty of questions about, even after we've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/">multiple impressive gameplay showcases for</a> it over the years.</p>



<p>You can pre-order Crimson Desert for its March 19, 2026, release date now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, with the standard edition coming in at <strong>$69.99</strong> and the digital deluxe edition coming in at <strong>$79.99.</strong> There's also a <strong>$279.99</strong> collector's edition you can grab, if you're so inclined.</p>

			<p>Today, German developer <strong>Keen Games</strong> has announced an update on the <strong>Enshrouded 1.0</strong> launch estimates. The independent studio is now tracking toward a <strong>Fall 2026</strong> release of the survival game, a delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original <strong>Spring 2026</strong> estimate</a>, although even that should not be taken as a hard date, especially following the delays that characterized the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-wake-of-the-water-update-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wake of the Water update</a>.</p>



<p>Keen also shared an updated roadmap, showing that there will be one major content update before the full launch. Version <strong>0.8</strong> is expected to drop at some point in Spring, adding bug fixes, balancing, and general improvements, as well as a key feature, <strong>Adventure Sharing</strong>, which lets players share their creations with the rest of the Enshrouded community from within the game. Version 1.0 will feature an advanced version of Adventure Sharing, equipped with traps, spawners, and logic elements. The logic system, in particular, is, to a degree, similar to what the developer created for their previous game, <strong>Portal Knights</strong>.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the full version will also feature a lot of polished elements, including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improved new player experience</li>



<li>Better quest progression</li>



<li>Various performance optimizations, especially for lower end PCs, and faster shader compilation</li>



<li>Several combat improvements, such as enhanced tactical depth and enemy variety, smarter enemy behavior, and improved balancing</li>



<li>New content: locations, enemies, and more</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Enshrouded 1.0 will also bring the game to consoles, further expanding the potential audience. The game has already been a massive success for Keen Games, having surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players in the first four days</a> on early access, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three million players a few months later</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four million players in April 2025</a>, and <strong>five million users</strong> just now.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new milestone is just one of many data points shared in the new infographics. According to Keen's logs, players have already collectively spent around <strong>20,901 years</strong> in Enshrouded, farmed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> plants and placed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> blocks of water, tamed 6 million pets, and destroyed <strong>30 million</strong> Shroud roots. However, they also drowned <strong>nearly half a million times</strong>, while over <strong>52.5 million player deaths</strong> were caused by fall damage.</p>

			<p>With just a few hours left before the official launch of the game <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> announced that the PC version will include support for <strong>DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong>, as well as, of course, for all the linked technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>



<p>According to NVIDIA, owners of a <strong>GeForce RTX 50 Series</strong> graphics card can expect to see their frame rates boosted by an average of <strong>3X</strong> at <strong>4K</strong> with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation enabled (and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode). At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 MFG <strong>enables most GeForce RTX GPUs to reach the in-game maximum threshold of 480 frames per second</strong>, though that's not particularly surprising given that the game is also made for mobile devices (and PlayStation 5). With all this performance headroom, it should be a no-brainer for everyone to activate the <strong>second-generation DLSS Super Resolution Transformer model</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA unveiled at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> to obtain improved visual quality. For the time being, you'll have to do it via the NVIDIA app, though native in-game support is also in development by Arknights: Endfield developer <strong>HYPERGRYPH</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game is a <strong>free-to-play action RPG</strong> with some simulation features thrown in for good measure. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's hands-on preview and bonus developer interview here</a>, while the system requirements are available below. The PC version isn't on Steam, by the way; you can only download the game via the official website's launcher or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Arknights: Endfield Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS Version</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-9400F or equivalent</td><td>Intel Core i7-10700K or equivalent or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB</td><td>16 GB or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or equivalent</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 or equivalent or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>DirectX 11</td><td>DirectX 11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>50 GB free space (+ 40 GB for unpacking)</td><td>SSD Recommended, 50 GB free space (+ 40 GB for unpacking)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Beyond the Arknights: Endfield news, NVIDIA also shared that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, too, both in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC demo that's currently out</a> and in the full game, due on February 19. Once again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</a> can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Moon Studios will release the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> co-op update</a>. The game already natively supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and now players can also upgrade to the second-gen Transformer model (DLSS 4.5) through the NVIDIA app for enhanced fidelity, especially when using the Performance and Ultra Performance modes.</p>



<p>Lastly, the indie open world co-op survival game <strong>The Gold River Project</strong>, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will be released with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, with the option to enable DLSS 4.5 in the NVIDIA app.</p>
