			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>
