			<p>At the moment, the reason behind these hacks is unknown, but clearly, it's so that they can get their hands on the valuable resources that can help you to become powerful in the late game. Path of Exile 2 finally made its way into <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Early Access after being highly anticipated</a> by those who are fans of the cRPG genre. However, it seems that those who are in the late game have logged on to find that their accounts have been compromised, with highly valuable resources missing from their stash and their inventories. Since inventories are shared between characters, this allows for easier leveling of any other classes that the player may try out. To lose such valuable items is a huge, devastating loss, as a lot of them require a ton of grinding to be able to obtain them in the first place.</p>
<p>Most shockingly, it seems that the hackers managed to make it past Steam 2FA without a bat of an eye. Some of those who were affected have said that they received an email from someone trying to get into their account, but somehow, they still managed to slide past the Steam 2FA anyway. If it's that easy to do, it means that Steam will likely have a bigger problem than just what is currently going on with Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>People are sharing their stories on the<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3667200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official Path of Exile forums</a>, where they share how they found out that their accounts had been compromised. It doesn't spell good news for those who were impacted, as Grinding Gear Games has said that they are unable to roll back the materials that were stolen by other players, basically leaving players to grind for the materials all over again, with hours of gameplay lost to a hacker.</p>
<p>It's reported that the hacker is known on the forums, as he would share updates as he was going. However, he would continuously change his username, making it hard to keep track of him. Whether there were more people involved remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn't just impacting Path of Exile 2. Even those who are still playing the original Path of Exile are finding their resources impacted, with tons of Gems and other valuable resources completely missing from their account. As a result of the hack, some players are finding that their accounts have now been banned, and they have lost access to the game.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games is tackling this and is working to resolve the bans on accounts that were impacted, but it's said that this process can take weeks to deal with, meaning that players won't have access to their Path of Exile 2 accounts for the unforeseeable.</p>
<p>If you've been hacked, please let us know your story in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-playstation-5-pro-issues-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR issues will be fixed in the near future, according to one of the game's developers.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-ps5-pro-upgrades-are-more-substantial-than-you-may-think">Digital Foundry</a>, the game's Principal Rendering Engineer Michal Drobot confirmed that the game's PSSR issues, which include white flickering pixels appearing in certain scenarios and smearing issues with ultra-fine details, will be addressed very soon, as fixes for these issues are already in the pipeline and will be rolled out soon once the relevant patch goes through QA. Reportedly, these issues are caused by PSSR not being fine-tuned for denoising the image in its current state, and, as such, works better in anti-aliasing the image but not denoising the flicker created by shadows, variable rate shading, and SSR.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon be fixed on PlayStation 5 Pro, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at how the development team improved the game on the system over the base model and how the engine was improved for the latest entry in the series. You can find the full analysis below.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>

			<p>The adventure games genre is usually a bit neglected by studios compared to more mainstream genres like action, roleplaying, and shooter. However, this year saw several great releases from indie and triple-A developers alike. Without further ado, let's dive into our shortlist for the best adventure game of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Indika-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indika</h2>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the year in the genre is undoubtedly Indika, the game developed by studio Odd Meter and published by 11 bit studios. In this game, set in the early 1800s in an alternate version of Russia, players step into the role of a young nun slowly adjusting to the harsh life of a convent. That's just the tip of the iceberg of her troubles, though, as Indika also somehow speaks with the Devil himself, who leads her on a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond the convent both physically and metaphorically. The game also features unique puzzle elements and 2D pixel art mini-games, as if its peculiar rendition of Russia wasn't already enticing enough.</p>
<p>Following its debut on PC, Indika recently launched on consoles, too, receiving widespread acclaim from fans and critics. It can be purchased for a 25% discount right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Riven_Key_Art_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Riven</h2>
<p>Old-school gamers probably need no introduction to Riven. For everyone else, this is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riven-unreal-engine-5-remake-to-launch-this-year-on-pc-with-vr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult classic second entry in the Myst series</a>. Following the release of the full remake of Myst, Cyan Worlds has prepared the same treatment for Riven, delivering a full 3D landscape remade in gorgeous Unreal Engine 5 and expanded with new puzzles and a deeper story. Virtual Reality users can immerse themselves even more fully into this mysterious island.</p>
<p>As a founding member among adventure games of the puzzle subgenre, it's great to see the Riven remake doing so well. Fans are now wondering whether Myst III: Exile will be next. Meanwhile, if you've yet to check it out, Riven can now be purchased at a 30% discount.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nobody-wants-to-die.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Nobody Wants to Die</h2>
<p>The other big surprise of 2024 came from Critical Hit Games, which released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobody-wants-to-die-developers-release-10-minute-exclusive-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Wants to Die</a> (published by PLAION) in the middle of July. Not exactly the best period to launch games, but this interactive story (think Quantic Dream's style) still managed to find its own niche.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Detective James Karra, and the story is set in a future (2329) version of New York City massively influenced by noir and cyberpunk settings. There's a serial killer on the loose who has been targeting upper class citizens. To complicate matters, Nobody Wants to Die takes a cue from the likes of Altered Carbon - here, too, the wealthy can afford to transfer their consciousness into new bodies to attain a sort of immortality. Karra also has his own tech gizmos to help him in the investigation, such as a time-manipulation augmentation that lets him review what happened at the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Die is currently 30% off on Steam.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dustborn_keyart_layered_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dustborn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Norwegian developer Red Thread Games has been a staple of our Best Adventure Games series over the years, thanks to releases like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamfall Chapters</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/draugen-full-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draugen</a>. Dustborn took longer to develop than the others, to be sure, but the result was quite worth the wait, according to reviewer Amy Eastland.</p>
<p><em>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</em></p>
<p>If you're into the concept of a road trip with friends across a dystopic USA where you play in a punk-rock band and also fight baddies with words, Dustborn is currently 60% off.</p>
<h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>2024 saved the best for last, as they say. With Lara Croft and Nathan Drake missing from the gaming market, MachineGames brought back the man who inspired those characters - Indiana Jones - in style with their newly released Great Circle. The game admittedly features quite a bit of action, but it still fits more with the adventure genre, as it relies a lot more on puzzle solving, exploration, and non-lethal solutions to disagreements. Here's the final excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>The game is highly successful so far, having already <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatched</a> a Game of the Year award from the Gamescom community, and Disney is reportedly very much open to greenlighting new Indiana Jones adventures.</p>

			<p>Among the best and most unexpected modding projects to launch this year was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, which brings some stunning visual improvements to one of the most popular role-playing games released this year, as highlighted by a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The end of 2024 montage shared by the project's developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> does an excellent job highlighting the improvements the mod currently brings to the game in pretty much every location in the game. From higher texture quality to improved lighting and much more, the fan-made project looks every bit as good as any proper remaster should.</p>

<p>The development of the Bloodborne Remaster Project was made possible by the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, which allows users to play the game developed by FromSoftware on PC even without an official port. A new version of the emulator bringing a variety of improvements was released <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/12/25/shadps4-v0-5-0-christmas-2024-release/">last week</a>, and made two more PlayStation 4 exclusives playable on PC - Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and The Witch &amp; The Hundred Knight 2. You can check out how the emulator runs both games in the videos below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first and only Grand Theft Auto 6 currently available has been found online in better quality, allowing fans to better appreciate its stunning visuals while they wait for Rockstar Games to finally show more of their highly anticipated open-world game.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/GTASixInfo/status/1873532834838900846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873532834838900846%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GTASixInfo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GameRollGTA</a> discovered a higher-quality version of the new trailer<span>&nbsp;compared to the one available on YouTube. This new version of the trailer, which was originally streamed on Chinese video streaming service BiliBili and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLzVdNhcdtwUvWkDA-9_ZrBpzAcc0bDl/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, has a higher bitrate than the YouTube version, which</span>&nbsp;makes it easier to appreciate some of the visual's finer details.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the release of the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, but the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games continues to become bigger by the day. Its release is expected by analysts to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch to date</a>, and its<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/"> release window will have an impact on the entire video game industry</a>, as other publishers are aiming to launch their games as far away from it as possible and are holding back setting release dates for them until Rockstar Games finally confirms if the game is indeed launching in late 2025, or if it will be delayed to 2026, which is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">definite possibility</a>, considering the game's scope.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
