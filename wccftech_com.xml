			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-reportedly-headline-februarys-ps-plus-extra-games/">Leaked earlier in the week by Dealabs</a> and confirmed at yesterday's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, the latest web-swinging adventure from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>, 2023's <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</strong> is the headlining title for the February 2026 batch of <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> games entering the Game Catalog. It enters the library of games that players have access to through their subscription, alongside <strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/">eight other games</a></strong>, including several of the more notable indie releases from the last few years.</p>



<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 wasn't the only game that was leaked ahead of this batch's official confirmation. <strong>Neva</strong> and <strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong> were also part of the leak, with the remaining seven games being surprises. </p>



<p>All of the games entering the PS Plus Extra Game Catalog this month will be available as of <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>. Of the nine joining the library, <strong>four</strong> of them are indie titles that you should take the time to check out if you've not played them before, particularly if you're a fan of strong narrative storytelling. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/venba/"><strong>Venba</strong>,</a> Neva, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/season-a-letter-to-the-future/"><strong>Season: A Letter to the Future</strong>,</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/echoes-of-the-end-review/">Echoes of the End</a></strong> are all indie games worth checking out, especially as games you can play as part of a larger subscription.</p>



<p>While Echoes of the End may be the weakest of the bunch in terms of its narrative chops, it does have more action-focused gameplay and a few puzzle mechanics that could keep you intrigued. This version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-free-update-improves-combat-and-more/">is also a much better one than what we played at launch</a> when we reviewed it, where it still featured several glaring technical and design issues. </p>



<p>Two other notable entries in this month's batch are the first two <strong>Monster Hunter Stories</strong> titles, which arrive just in time for anyone who has been intrigued by trailers for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> but missed the first two games.</p>



<p>As for PS Plus Premium subscribers, they are only getting one game in this batch of releases, which is <strong>Disney Pixar's Wall-E</strong>, a game made by <strong>Asobo Studio</strong> that first arrived on the PlayStation 2 back in 2008.</p>
