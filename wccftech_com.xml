			<p>Digital Extremes has hosted its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHoyHxbj0s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final devstream for 2024</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> was understandably the focus of the conversation. The upcoming free update will introduce a full-fledged romance system to Warframe, and Creative Director Rebecca Ford revealed that there will be two novels worth of lines dedicated to the relationship/romance via the new in-game chat system with fellow members of the Hex squad.</p>
<p><em>What we've done with Warframe: 1999 is we've basically tried to make as authentic an experience as possible which is in who are you chatting with in 1999 and how did you chat with them. It lets you connect with the Hex and learn about them, what they like, and what they don't like. It doesn't have to be romantic; you don't even have to do it at all, because the bounties will get you chemistry, but so does this system. Our goals with this system were for it to be really immersive for people who want deeper relationships with the NPCs we make. It gets you a sort of immersive and fictional and deeper way to connect. There's two novels worth of words. The count clocked in today at 166,00 words.</em></p>
<p><em>You have to kind of figure out who they are. You can ask different questions you can learn a little bit about them. For those of you who are into the more character side of our games,&nbsp; there is a bit of an endgame for this system. We're not going to talk too much about it. This isn't a system that's going to have sort of like instant gratification.</em></p>
<p>We also learned that a new 'PvPvE' mode called Faceoff will be added with Warframe: 1999. Eight players will split into two teams and run a friendly competition on opposite sides of HÃ¶llvania to take on various objectives for The Hex while fighting off endless enemy waves.</p>
<p>During the match, players can accrue points to unlock Boosts (buffs) for their team and Hindrances (debuffs) for the rival squad to get distinct advantages like guaranteed critical damage against enemies for a limited time, or even send missile strikes to bombard the other team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Digital Extremes keeps working on the base game, too. The new player experience is being improved with increased capacity for weapon and Warframe slots and the removal of cooldowns for the Master Rank Test on failed completion. In addition to reworking Trinity, Nyx will get a light rework in preparation for her Protoframe debut. Her abilities will receive a user interface visibility overhaul, Mind Control will guarantee radiation damage types, Psychic Bolts will receive two additional bolts, and her Absorb ultimate will receive an overall mobility and damage buff.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to Warframe: 1999?</p>
