			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due to launch in a little more than two weeks from the time of this writing, and Techland has been publishing a series of <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-bts-creating-dying-light-the-beast-road-to-launch/">behind-the-scenes</a> developer blogs and releasing new trailers leading up to its September 19, 2025 launch.</p>



<p>Today's <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/behind-the-beast-parkour-and-combat">deep dive</a> included the release of a new trailer, showing off more gameplay and Kyle Crane's struggle with controlling the Beast within him.</p>

<p>Alongside the new trailer, Techland delved into its approach to parkour and combat mechanics in Dying Light: The Beast, adding "<em>over 100 new animations</em>" and 17 new grab animations to properly convey Crane's agility and ferociousness.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast was technically supposed to have launched by now, with its initial release date set for August 22. Less than a month before that August date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">Techland announced</a> it had delayed the game by four weeks to September 19.</p>



<p>When we last checked the game out for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/"> final preview</a>, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't able to give any definitive thoughts on what he played due to only being able to check out an early part of the game, but he was sure about one element, saying, "<em>One thing's for certain though: years of captivity have turned Kyle Crane into a raging beast</em>." </p>

			<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">Game Developer</a>, 2K studio Firaxis Games has suffered layoffs, and while 2K wouldn't say exactly how many developers were impacted, sources Game Developer spoke to indicated that "<em>dozens</em>" of employees were affected.</p>



<p>2K cites the layoffs as an effort to "<em>restructure and optimize</em>" the studio for "<em>adaptability, collaboration, and creativity.</em>" One of the impacted developers, Emma Kidwell, is an award-winning writer who wrote for leaders on Civilization VII and Marvel's Midnight Suns characters Deadpool and Storm. In her LinkedIn post about being impacted, Kidwell wrote that she is "<em>an incredibly adaptable writer</em>."</p>







<p>Lead character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-davis-8622094b_opentowork-activity-7369385506641510402-mCSx/">Matthew Davis</a>, producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mnhimel_opentowork-activity-7369387462151897089-FdX4/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo">Maya H.</a>, senior quality assurance specialist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/logan-blackwood-they-them-451a26270_opentowork-activity-7369381857433505794-GAuW/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo">Logan Blackwood</a>, and artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniella-zeman-656b4293_daniella-zeman-activity-7369417355229171712-Y2Uk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Daniella Zeman</a> are among those who've publicly posted about being impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Firaxis is the latest Take-Two studio to be impacted by layoffs, as Cloud Chamber, the studio currently working on the next BioShock game, cut <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">80 developers last month</a> as part of a major restructuring to help get BioShock 4 back on track after being in development limbo for years.</p>
