			<p>Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker, Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash, is getting ready to release its next game, Possessor(s), which it has announced will arrive on PC and PS5 on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Possessor(s) is a 2D search-action title where you play as Luca, but you also play as Rhem, the demon possessing Luca, as you both work together to escape the clutches of a company called Agradyne, who was using demons like Rhem to power the energy they sold to Sanzu City, the game's setting.</p>



<p>A gameplay overview trailer that debuted today alongside the release date news shows off the art and design chops Heart Machine is known for, while also delving into what Possessor(s) is about, and a bit more on how the high school-aged Luca and the demon Rhem ended up having to work together.</p>

<p>The launch of Possessor(s) will mark the second major release for Heart Machine in 2025 as it started the year with the early access launch of Hyper Light Breaker. Since then, the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-buried-below-arrives-next-week-game-key-giveaway/">received multiple updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/497207097933433675?l=english">having arrived earlier this week</a>, as Heart Machine continues to fix and tweak the game in collaboration with its community.</p>



<p>Unlike Hyper Light Breaker, Possessor(s) is not releasing in early access, with the complete game set to launch in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a law focused on protecting Brazil's youth online</a>, a ban on loot boxes for those under 18 in Brazil has been signed into law by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and will go into effect in March 2026, per a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-campaign-against-predatory-in-game-practices-takes-a-step-forward-in-brazil-as-president-lula-bans-loot-boxes-targeted-at-under-18s">Eurogamer</a>.</p>



<p>Specifically, when the law goes into effect in March, as it currently stands, games that have loot boxes will have to be rated as 18+, and any rated below that will be prohibited from including them.</p>



<p>It's the latest update in governing bodies across the world, looking more closely at loot boxes in videogames. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/dutch-government-intends-to-ban-lootboxes-in-games-alltogether/">2023, the Dutch government put forth a motion to ban loot boxes</a> in games altogether, and back in 2018, Belgium also banned loot boxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-cease-sales-fifa-points-belgium/">prompting the sale of FIFA points to cease in the region</a>.</p>



<p>There's also been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-loot-box-class-action-lawsuit-canada-costly/">cases of lawsuits brought to game companies</a> over loot boxes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lootboxes-battlefront-ii-gambling-banned/">whether they constitute gambling</a>. Though there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-ultimate-team-packs-arent-gambling-rules-austrian-court/">rulings pointing towards them not being gambling</a>, they remain a controversial element of modern gaming's live service era.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how strictly this current ban in Brazil is enforced, and how game companies respond to the new law once it officially goes into effect in March of next year. Even before then, we could likely see companies lobbying in an attempt to change the law, so that we don't have a case of, as a hypothetical, EA Sports FC being rated as 18+ in Brazil, and as a game suitable for children everywhere else.</p>



<p>Though if the ban does prove effective, it could be that one of the videogame industry's largest sticking points is slowly changed through further legislation like what Brazil is implementing in other parts of the world.</p>
