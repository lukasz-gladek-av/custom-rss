			<p>Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-gamescom-first-look-and-qa-a-crpg-about-magic-vs-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style of game</a> that New Arc Line was shaping up to be, it had some pretty big boots to fill. I wasn't sure what to expect with my time with New Arc Line, but I found that for the vast majority of my playthrough of the cRPG that is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available in early access</a>, I was pleasantly surprised. The game has a lot of potential but still needs just a little bit more fine-tuning to really make it shine.</p>
<p>Diving into the game, you are greeted with character creation, as with any proper roleplaying game. While it doesn't quite live up to the extensive customization options featured in Baldur's Gate 3, there is enough variety to still make your character yours. What I found disappointing was the chance to choose between only two classes. Whether this was just for this early access or a permanent feature, I'm unsure at the moment. Regardless, instead of choosing the tech themed class, I went for the Voodoo class. Anything with magic or necromancy is always up my alley, and I won't pass up an opportunity to play it. The other main gripe I had with character creation was the inability to zoom in on your character's face, meaning you can't tweak the fine details exactly how you'd like.</p>

<p>Getting into the prologue of the game, I was stunned by how beautiful the game was. It felt like a mix between BioShock Infinite and Disco Elysium, and I was all here for it. It reproduced the entirely underrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steampunk fantasy setting</a> through a highly immersive dystopia. However, while I did enjoy the world-building throughout my time with New Arc Line, I would understand if people stopped playing during the prologue. It's a bit of a grind to get through, as your character shuffles about at a snail's pace, and there is a rather wide region to explore, especially if you like getting all the knickknacks as I do.</p>
<p>I was continuously impressed by the finer graphical details. The water was so beautifully animated and had sparkles in all the right places, which helped add to that utopia versus dystopia vibe, especially when you're first entering the New World. I liked that, to find out which of the nearby items was interactable, I could just hold down Alt, and it would highlight them, similar to the system in Baldur's Gate 3. On the flip side, the hitboxes were a little bit off. You had to have your mouse a fair amount of space away from the marker to be able to collect anything or speak with someone. During battles, this made it far too difficult, and this is where I started to lose interest.</p>
<p>The voice-acting felt fitting to New Arc Line, but it was also a tad confusing trying to guess which messages would be voice-acted. Sometimes, I was expecting the paragraph to be narrated, and it simply wasn't, with other insignificant paragraphs being narrated instead. The narration and voice-acting felt very inconsistent, as if they couldn't decide which parts should be narrated and which should be left for the player to read themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it came to battling for the first time, I didn't really enjoy the UI layout. It felt very small and cramped, and it was easy to miss details beneficial to the fight. Additionally, the hitbox issue proved to cause a lot of problems during the battle and led to my companion dying on the docks because of this. I would try to target one of the enemies, and it would very clearly hover over that specific enemy, only for my character to attack the other enemy. This happened multiple times throughout, which is what led to my companion dying, as he was taking unnecessary hits from an enemy that should have already died.</p>
<p>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed, and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. This game has a lot of potential, and you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm excited to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</p>

			<p>Today, Creative Assembly made the announcement that Total War: WARHAMMER III's newest DLC will be launching on December 12. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This DLC is named Omens of Destruction</a> and will include a ton of new content for players to get stuck into. This includes faction expansions, a new Legendary Lord, and much more. Now, let's dive into the nitty gritty about what you can expect from Total War: WARHAMMER III's DLC, Omens of Destruction.</p>
<p>Omens of Destruction focuses on expanding the factions of Khorne, Greenskins, and Ogre Kingdoms by adding new lords, heroes, and units. In addition, there will be new gameplay mechanics for players to utilize and master in Immortal Empires.</p>
<p>In addition to this content, as part of Patch 6.0 of Total War: WARHAMMER III, the 100th Legendary Lord will be added to the game as free content. This Legendary Lord is Arbaal the Undefeated, the champion of Khorne. As part of the patch, players will also see a faction update arrive in the game for the Ogre Kingdoms, Khorne, and Orcs &amp; Goblins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving on to the paid DLC content, there are three significant updates to the factions being added. First is Skulltaker, the Hero Slayer, Khorne's immortal champion and the best of all Bloodletters. With the addition of Skulltaker comes a Cloak of Skulls, which is a campaign feature. Skulltaker is tasked with seeking out enemy lords and defeating them. They excel in dueling and hunting. Along with Khorne's new champion, there will be new units to experiment with. This includes two legendary heroes named Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Orcs &amp; Goblins, players will get to play as Gorbad Ironclaw, the Brutal Unifier. He is one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses. The campaign feature for Gorbad is named Da' Plan, where you have to experiment and try to utilize unique battle tactics for your armies. Compared to Skulltaker, his playstyle is rather different. He rides into battle on his Warboar named Gnarla. He is able to close the gap between him and his enemies by charging in and using his hefty axe in close combat.&nbsp; There are new units, including the legendary hero Sngla Grobspit, as well as warriors like the Savage Orc Great Shaman and Night Goblin Big Boss.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Golgfag Maneater, the Mercenary. They are one of the most successful Ogre mercenaries of all time. In their campaign feature, you have to take on mercenary contracts where you help out your clients across the expansive Warhammer World to help settle their disputes with enemies. When Golgfag is in battle, he uses a wide variety of barbaric weaponry to secure the kills. Of course, there are also new units for the Ogres, which includes the Legendary Hero Bragg the Gutsman, as well as the Ogre Paymaster and Bruiser.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the expansive iceberg, and there are plenty more units for you to explore and utilize on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the battlefield</a> in Total War: WARHAMMER III's upcoming DLC. You don't have long to wait, as it's set to release on December 12. Make sure to check out the trailer above to see some of the content in action.</p>
