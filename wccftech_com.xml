			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the next game coming from Silent Hill 2 Remake and Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team, and though we don't have a solid release date for it beyond a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Fall 2025 release window</a>, we do have a new look at gameplay with a new 10-minute gameplay showcase.</p>



<p>The video shows the protagonist digging through Sector A-0, showing off how you'll manipulate gravity and your environment in order to move towards your objective. It also shows more layers to the horror gameplay that the sci-fi adventure will feature, as you carefully and slowly creep around each corner, finger on the trigger of your weapon, ready to defend yourself against whatever monstrosity awaits.</p>

<p>First revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/">October 2024</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn looks to be the most confident and the most terrifying work from Bloober Team yet. While the studio's history as a horror game developer began strong with Layers of Fear, it faltered with back-to-back lacklustre releases that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwityLnytNOOAxVY2MkDHRPGLksQFnoECBUQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q6lWprVE2HpS_CCCQT0qJ">the studio even admitted were poor</a>.</p>



<p>It has since turned things around following its success with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, which has led to the studio also taking on a remake of the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Silent Hill</a> game.</p>



<p>We've seen plenty of Cronos: The New Dawn gameplay at this point, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/">recent deep-dive just weeks ago</a>. The only thing we're really missing from Cronos: The New Dawn, is a release date. Hopefully, we'll hear about one soon. </p>

			<p>Out of Time is a new multiplayer roguelike third-person action game from developer <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> that will launch this coming September 25, 2025, on PC, and will initially be exclusively available on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vi-all-dlc-free-on-epic-games-store/">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<p>Out of Time puts players in a world where an event called "<em>The Shattering</em>" has ruptured space and time, leaving a final safe haven for people across all timelines called Infinitopia. Outside of Infinitopia's safety, however, you'll be charged with trying to save the remaining members of mankind from threats like dinosaurs, giant mechs, dragons, evil humanoids, mutant crabs, killer robots, and practically everything else that can exist across the entire timeline of the universe. </p>

<p>"<em>With </em><em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids," said Jordan Maynard, chief creative officer at Manticore Games, in a press release. "<em>The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!</em>"</p>

<p>Out of Time is available to pre-purchase on the Epic Games Store on PC for $24.99 USD, and while Manticore Games is clear on it only initially being an EGS exclusive, it does not say when the game will be heading to Steam. Chief executive officer at Manticore Games, Frederic Descamps, does add that there are plans to bring it to other platforms, he just doesn't specify which ones.</p>



<p>"<em>Manticore’s mission is to create complex immersive multiplayer experiences. We’ve built </em><em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core UGC platform and Unreal. <em>We’re already planning more eras and PvP modes, plus additional platforms."</em></p>
