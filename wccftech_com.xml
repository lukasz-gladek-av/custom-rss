			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has a lot of systems that its players need to be aware of, and while the gear you take with you each time you go <strong>Topside</strong> is important, you also need to be levelling up your Raider's skill tree appropriately, if you want to be able to make the best of your runs.</p>



<p>While completing the full <strong>Skill Tree</strong> is a slog, since you don't just have to unlock skills by spending individual points, you need to spend a certain amount of skill points in each of the three sections (<strong>Conditioning, Mobility,</strong> and <strong>Survival</strong>) to move into the second and third tiers of skills. </p>



<p>That means you don't want to needlessly spend your skill points on skills that won't have as much of an impact on your playing experience. This guide will show you which of the skills in the skill tree are the best in the game, and what you should be focusing on.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-skills-in-arc-raiders-guide">The Best Skills in ARC Raiders - Guide</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The ARC Raiders skill tree.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-conditioning-skills">Best Conditioning Skills</h3>



<p>The <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch of skills is all about keeping your Raider in top shape for the marathon that is going on runs Topside. The skills in this branch help toughen your Raider in bad situations, with some restoring stamina and health while you're low on health, and others that make you more proficient at common elements of the game, like breaching containers and how fast you can be with extra weight on your back. </p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Conditioning branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Used to the Weight</strong> - Wearing a shield doesn't slow you down as much</li>



<li><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> - Breaching doors and containers takes less time</li>



<li><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> - When you're critically hurt, your stamina regenerates faster</li>



<li><strong>Downed but Determined</strong> - When you're downed, it takes longer before you collapse</li>



<li><strong>A Little Bit Extra</strong> - Breaching an object generates resources</li>
</ul>



<p>The first on the list, <strong>Used to the Weight</strong>, is also the first Conditioning skill you'll unlock. Its description (read above) might not sound like a lot on the face of it, but when you consider that you'll be wearing a shield every time you're Topside, you immediately understand why it's essential. So essential that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> put it at the beginning of the branch, to ensure you don't miss it. </p>



<p>When you've unlocked the rest of the skills in the opening tier of the Conditioning branch, and you're looking for skills to dump points into so you can continue to the next tier, Used to the Weight should be one of the first skills you max out.</p>



<p><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong>, <strong>Downed but Determined</strong>, and <strong>A Little Bit Extra </strong>are all fairly self-explanatory in their importance. You're constantly breaching things open to get resources, and you're vulnerable while breaching something. You should work to make this as quick as possible. While Downed but Determined gives you a greater chance at survival if you do go down, with other players having more time to pick you back up. Lastly, A Little Bit Extra is just that - extra resources that can go a long way to making breaching anything and everything worth more.</p>



<p><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> is just as key as actually increasing your max stamina (which we'll get to in the <strong>Mobility </strong>section). You'll find yourself in a lot of tough situations in ARC Raiders. Having your stamina regenerate faster in those situations will help you get out of a lot of jams that would've otherwise killed you.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-mobility-skills">Best Mobility Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Conditioning branch helps keep your Raider in top shape, the <strong>Mobility </strong>branch keeps you nimble and mobile, with skills that directly impact your stamina, both how much you have and how it regenerates, how fast you are, and how far actions like jumping and vaulting can take you.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Mobility branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Youthful Lungs - </strong>Increases your max stamina</li>



<li><strong>Marathon Runner</strong> - Moving around costs less stamina</li>



<li><strong>Calming Stroll</strong> - While walking, your stamina regenerates as if you were standing still</li>



<li><strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> - When you're downed, you crawl faster</li>



<li><strong>Heroic Leap</strong> - You can Sprint Dodge Roll further</li>
</ul>



<p>Like some of the skills in the Conditioning branch, the importance of skills like <strong>Youthful Lungs, Marathon Runner, </strong>and <strong>Calming Stroll</strong> is all pretty self-explanatory. Everything you do impacts your stamina, so levelling up Youthful Stroll to give you more is a no-brainer; the same goes for Marathon Runner to make the stamina you do have go further. Calming Stroll helps you keep that stamina up and ready for when you need it, like being surprised by a Hornet or a Rocketeer you didn't notice was patrolling by, and you accidentally walked right into its sightline.</p>



<p>I can tell you from experience that <strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> (especially when paired with <strong>Downed But Determined</strong>) can be the difference between you making it back to Speranza alive or a failed run. Not successfully extracting stings, and it stings even more if the difference was just a few feet and your Raider's inability to stay alive for a few seconds longer. </p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Heroic Leap</strong> can be an essential skill for combat. As noted in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">Tips and Tricks Guide</a></strong>, plenty of the maps you'll visit in ARC Raiders have a serious lack of cover, and getting caught out in the open without a place to hide or duck behind can mean a resource-draining fight, or worse, the end of your run. Heroic Leap can take you that extra bit to help you stay ahead of ARCs and other players while in combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-survival-skills">Best Survival Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The third and final branch of the skill tree in ARC Raiders, the <strong>Survival</strong> branch, is all about skills that keep your instincts sharp while Topside. Some of that includes skills that impact how much noise you make and how you interact with looting resources, while some of the skills give you additional abilities to use while Topside.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the <strong>Survival </strong>branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>In-Round Crafting - </strong>Unlocks the ability to field-craft items while Topside.</li>



<li><strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> - Increases the maximum weight you can carry.</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Instincts</strong> - When searching a container, loot is revealed faster.</li>



<li><strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> - Your stamina regeneration is less affected by being over-encumbered.</li>



<li><strong>Minesweeper</strong> - Mines and explosives can be defused when in close proximity.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> is an obvious one, because it means you don't have to rely on bringing as many bandages and shield rechargers as you can carry. You'll be able to craft items like those on the fly while Topside, freeing up more space in your backpack for more tactical items. <strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> and <strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> are two skills that work in tandem with each other. One increases your carrying capacity, while the other ensures that even if you go beyond your limits, you won't be impacted as greatly as you could've been.</p>



<p><strong>Minesweeper</strong> is another that's important for obvious reasons, because being able to defuse explosives can help give you the upper hand when fighting enemy Raiders trying to get the jump on you. Lastly, <strong>Looter's Instinct</strong> works in tandem with <strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> from the <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch. Not only will you be faster when it comes to breaching, but Looter's Instinct helps to make the actual looting part as quick as possible, so you're not left vulnerable in the looting menu for longer than you need to be.</p>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>The five skills listed in each section are, in my experience, the best skills to put levels into as soon as you can, and the ones you should focus on unlocking the most. That said, there are a few that I did want to make sure I highlighted, so you don't needlessly ignore them.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sturdy Ankles </strong>(<strong>Mobility</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Luck</strong> (<strong>Survival</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Loaded Arms </strong>(<strong>Conditioning</strong>)</li>
</ul>

As a demanding Unreal Engine 5 game, many PC gamers — on various PC setups, including high-end ones — have unfortunately voiced their frustrations when it comes to the game's performance profile.</p>



<p>This guide should hopefully help you attain an optimal balance between performance and visuals. We will break down how each graphics setting impacts performance and visuals in the form of video comparisons, and provide you with a ready-to-use optimized settings table that should improve your performance without <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">completely</em> sacrificing visual fidelity.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-code-vein-ii-a-brief-overview">About Code Vein II — A Brief Overview</h2>



<p>Released on January 29, 2026, on PC (via Steam), <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> is the sequel to Bandai Namco’s anime-inspired action RPG, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/">Code Vein</a></em>, blending stylish characters and high-octane Souls-like combat with an open-world twist. Early reviews praise its combat and world design, but many critics and PC players alike have flagged performance issues even on fairly powerful rigs.</p>

<p>Even with recommended specs, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> can dip below target framerates in open-world and intense combat scenes, thus highlighting the need for extra tuning of the game's graphics settings in order to achieve better performance/visuals ratios.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the game does have a Pipeline State Object (PSO)/shader compilation step, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">which,</strong> in my experience,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> was quite effective as I failed to spot a single instance of shader compilation stutter</strong>.

<h2 id="h-graphics-settings-breakdown-visuals-vs-performance"><strong>Graphics Settings Breakdown — Visuals vs Performance</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we will explore the various graphics settings in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II, </em>via comparison videos that should show case both the graphics and performance (in terms of FPS) of each setting, thus allowing us to determine which settings strike the best visuals/performance balance, which is the basis for establishing optimized graphical settings in this game, or any other game for that matter.</p>



<p>Also, please be aware of the fact that the graphics settings comparisons in this section have all been made on a system with the following specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-14700K;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM:</strong> 32 GB DDR5-7000 CL34;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Storage:</strong> 2 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Operating System:</strong> Windows 11 25H2;</li>



<li>All system firmware, drivers, BIOS, and OS updates were fully applied before testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Also, all of the comparisons were done under <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU limited scenarios at a resolution of 2560x1440 (1440p) with TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) as the temporal upscaling solution at the native resolution (100% render scale)</strong>, as in this game — like most other Unreal Engine 5 games — the GPU will largely be the performance limiting factor rather than the CPU (or other system components), unless you were aiming to achieve some really high framerates. Furthermore, please be aware of the fact that lowering GPU-intensive graphics settings (which are basically all of the following settings) will not affect a game's performance if the rest of your system (mainly CPU and system memory) is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> too slow to keep up with your GPU</strong>.</p>



<p>First of all, let's take a look at the game's graphics setting menu, with all of its subsections:</p>


<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part 1</em></figcaption></figure>
</p>

<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part </em>2</figcaption></figure>
</p>

<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-3.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part </em>3</figcaption></figure>
</p>


<p>We can see that the game supports all major temporal upscaling solutions, <strong>with the exception of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-3-mfg-multi-frame-gen-up-to-4x-mode-unveiled-coming-to-all-arc-gpus/">Intel's XeSS</a></strong>. Unfortunately, we can also see that <strong>the game supports no frame generation technologies</strong>, which would've been useful to further increase the game's smoothness, albeit at the cost of potential visual artifacts and higher latency.</p>



<p>Another thing that's worth mentioning is that in the following comparisons, you might sometimes spot differences in lighting that go beyond changing the relevant graphics setting. This is unfortunately due to the fact that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the game has a rapidly changing dynamic weather system</strong>, which makes it really difficult to capture completely like-for-like scenes in video format at different time frames.</p>



<p>With that said, let us finally delve into the visuals/performance profile of each relevant graphics setting that the game offers.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Note</strong>: The comparison videos have a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to-set-up-high-quality-performance-overlays-with-rtss/">CapFrameX/RTSS based overlay</a> that contains performance data regarding two metrics that we feel are relevant to gauge the performance profile of each graphics setting, which <span>are<strong>&nbsp;real-time</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> framerate (FPS)</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dedicated GPU memory (VRAM) usage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-draw-distance"><strong>Draw Distance</strong></h3>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>We can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Draw Distance</strong>" setting seems to control the distance at which various game assets <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> such as rocks, pebbles, and foliage <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> are drawn on the screen. We can also see that the various levels of this setting don't really affect performance much differently, and that the two lowest settings especially exhibit noticeable pop-in of certain assets in the ground. <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Therefore, we recommend using the "Farthest" level for this setting</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-anti-aliasing-processing-and-render-scaling-aka-temporal-upscalers"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong> <strong>(AKA Temporal Upscalers)</strong></h3>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong>" settings are intricately linked with each other, as the former setting controls the type of temporal upscaling/anti-aliasing solution to tackle the game's aliasing and/or to also upscale a lower-resolution input into a higher-resolution one, and the latter setting controls the per-resolution axis upscaling factor (in terms of percentages from 40% to 100%). <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Our recommendations for this setting simply depend on your GPU vendor</strong>: NVIDIA GPU users should obviously use <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/">DLSS Super Resolution</a>, whereas both AMD <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> except AMD RDNA4 users who may be able to utilize the way more advanced FSR 4 upscaling via the AMD Adrenalin GPU driver interface <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and Intel GPU users should simply avoid FSR (version 3.1) upscaling at all costs <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> given its incredibly soft and shimmery output <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and instead use Unreal Engine 5's included TSR (Temporal Super Resolution), whose quality and performance impact can be controlled from the Anti-Aliasing setting, which we shall see a bit further down.</p>

<p>This setting controls the quality of Unreal Engine 5's TSR, and given the fact that there aren't any major differences in visual quality between the different levels on display here, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">we recommend that users stick with the "Medium" setting</strong>, as a safe and balanced option when it comes to its performance/visuals balance.</p>

<p>We recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" shadow quality setting, as in our opinion, it strikes the best visuals/performance ratio out of all levels on display in the above video. However, should players encounter distracting shadow flickering — especially in some tree/foliage heavy areas of the game — then we recommend that they bump it up to the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">High</strong>" level, and avoid the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highest</strong>" level unless they have a lot of GPU horsepower to spare.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>For the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Texture</strong>" setting, we simply did not observe any differences in both performance and texture quality of some game assets, like rocks and walls. This is perhaps reflected in the fact that the GPU dedicated VRAM usage meter doesn't really seem to differ between all levels of the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Texture</strong>" setting. However, since the game was allocating <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least</em> 8 GB of GPU memory at 1440p on our RTX 4090 GPU, we <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">recommend that people not play this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> at least at this resolution or higher <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> on GPUs with less than 8 GB of VRAM, </strong>lest they encounter increased stuttering and hitching due to insufficient video memory capacity.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Effects</strong>" setting seems to control the quality of special effects such as GPU-accelerated particles and certain transparencies. From the performance/visuals ratio of each level of this setting, we can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Medium</strong>" level should be adequate for most people looking to strike a decent balance in both visuals and performance.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Material</strong>" graphics setting is a bit of an odd one, and one we think is sadly poorly explained by the game developers. We think it controls the quality of specular highlights and reflections, and it seems that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Low</strong>" level performs clearly better than the higher levels. However, in rainy weather, the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Low</strong>" level simply destroys the specular highlights of various game assets, such as rocks and characters. The "High" setting obviously has the highest visual quality, though it also comes at a performance cost. Therefore, we recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" level of this setting.</p>

<p>You can further improve your <em>Code Vein II</em> performance <strong>by combining both optimized graphics settings and temporal upscaling from a lower input resolution</strong>, not to mention that <strong>you could also overclock your GPU to further boost your framerates and frametime consistency</strong>. Just make sure that your overclock is fully stable!</p>

<h2 id="h-final-words"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Words</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> did not impress us with its ratio of visual fidelity and performance. Even among the slew of many dozen Unreal Engine 5 games that are available on both consoles and PC, the game simply fails to achieve a satisfying balance between performance and visuals, and is therefore in need of multiple updates to further improve its performance. The lack of XeSS upscaling and frame generation technologies is also a sore technical point in the delivered package.</p>



<p id="h-">Still, with smart tweaking of individual graphics settings (including temporal upscaling), you can achieve a somewhat decent experience in this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> especially if your hardware is up to snuff <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em>, as fully maxed-out visuals often come at an unnecessarily steep performance cost that's well within diminishing returns in terms of extra visual flair. It’s a balancing act worth mastering for the best experience, at least in our opinion.</p>

			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong>, like most major triple-A publishers and developers, gets its fair share of criticism, and since the company announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last month</a>, it's been getting far more than its fair share. The reset saw it cancel the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, among other projects, while others were delayed, and the company confirmed that there would not only be more layoffs coming, but it would end its remote work policies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">instituting a <strong>return-to-office mandate</strong></a>.</p>



<p>All of this, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">the introduction of a voluntary layoff program</a> at Ubisoft's headquarters in <strong>Paris</strong>, has sparked heavy criticism from those outside of the company, and even those internally, including from Ubisoft Montreal team lead <strong>David Michaud-Cromp</strong>. Michaud-Cromp directly criticized the return-to-office mandate on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_why-companies-force-people-back-in-the-office-activity-7420149620619509761-ihnP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> shortly after it was announced.</p>



<p>"<em>So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they 'believe in collaboration'... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office...(Spoiler alert: it's not about efficiency or collaboration)</em>," Michaud-Cromp wrote. </p>



<p>Not too long after that post, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-activity-7422041590854238208-HRdB?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">he shared that he was put on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension</a>, writing, "<em>The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Michaud-Cromp confirmed in yet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_today-i-was-terminated-by-ubisoft-effective-activity-7424133083051978757-F2ho?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">another post on his LinkedIn account</a> that he had been fired from Ubisoft. "<em>Today, I was terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately. This was not my decision. I won’t be discussing internal details or circumstances. I’m taking time to regroup and will share next steps when appropriate.</em>"</p>



<p>When Wccftech reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on the situation, a representative gave the following statement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal. We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity and repetition of the breach. We won't comment further."</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>With Michaud-Cromp and Ubisoft unwilling and unable to go into the details of his termination, we'll likely never know what about his comments crossed a line, or if something was said internally during his discussions with management that also impacted his termination. </p>



<p>What we do know is that Michaud-Cromp is an advocate for work environments with strong communication between team members, whether they're remote, in-office, or a hybrid. Speaking to Kotaku, Michaud-Cromp said, "<em>In my experience, whether remote or hybrid teams are effective has less to do with physical proximity and more to do with fundamentals like clarity of goals, trust, documentation, tooling, and communication practices. Teams that invest in those areas tend to function well regardless of location, while teams that struggle with them often face challenges even when fully co-located.</em>"</p>



<p>When Ubisoft announced the return-to-office mandate, it claimed it was "<em>to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.
