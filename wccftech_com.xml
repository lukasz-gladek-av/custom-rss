			<p>After <strong>MegaCrit</strong> missed <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">its initial 2025 release goal</a> for <strong>Slay the Spire 2</strong>, the beloved indie developer confirmed today that the long-awaited sequel to the popular roguelike deckbuilder will arrive on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong> Announced during the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fDrSpYlXYI">Indie Fan Fest</a></strong>, its <strong>Early Access</strong> release trailer includes a few sneak peeks at gameplay mixed in between some high-quality animations.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">Back in September 2025</a>, when MegaCrit confirmed that Slay the Spire 2 wouldn't arrive in 2025, it gave a release window that was vague and specific at the same time. The studio confirmed the game would arrive on "<em>a secret Thursday in March</em>." Now we know that Thursday will be the one coming in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>



<p>The return to the Spire will include characters old and new, along with new cards, motives, and plenty of secrets to uncover. It'll also feature four-player co-op if you'd rather have some friends along the way while you make the difficult climb up the Spire.</p>

<p>"<em>The Spire truly is ever-changing</em>,<em> in more ways than one,</em>" reads a post on the game's Steam page that went live alongside the announcement. "<em>More content - including cards, events, environments, enemies, and more - will be added and balanced throughout Early Access. Join the journey early to be part of the Spire's next evolution</em>."</p>



<p>Pre-orders for the game are not yet live, but you can, of course, add it to your wishlist to stay updated for when those pre-orders go live. Slay the Spire 2 was one of our picks for our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Most Anticipated Indie Games of 2026,</a> and it'll be interesting to see how well it matches up to our expectations. </p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">Embark Studios</a></strong> has just revealed the next update and <strong>map condition</strong> coming to <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, with <strong>hurricanes</strong> arriving next week on <strong>February 24, 2026,</strong> in the game's new <strong>Shrouded Sky </strong>update.</p>



<p>The short teaser doesn't show any gameplay, but it does make it clear how disruptive and dangerous the hurricanes will be for raiders who choose to brave the weather while the condition is in effect. A <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">blog post</a> on the ARC Raiders' official website digs further into what raiders will have to deal with, and it's a little more than some high-speed winds.</p>



<p>"<em>The climate is damaged and unpredictable, causing violent weather events across the surface,</em>" the post reads. "<em>You've already experienced some of them, but southern Italy is about to kick up another challenge to Raiders who dare to brave the surface</em>."</p>

<p>Trying to run against the winds, as you might imagine, will slow you down and quickly drain your stamina. You'll also have to be aware of the wind when trying to toss grenades or other throwables, since they can be swept away into the wind if you don't properly plan your throw. You also won't be able to rely on gas grenades and smoke grenades in the same way, as a turn of the wind will impact them as well.</p>



<p>You'll also have to be aware of flying debris, whether that's flying bits of dirt or something much larger that could do some huge damage if you're not careful. Whatever it is, though, your shield will take damage from flying debris and make you more visible to other raiders. That said, if you choose to risk going Topside without a shield, that'll provide another layer of camouflage, since you won't be spotted by the constant flash of your shield. </p>



<p>Speaking of visibility, that's also going to be far more limited during the hurricanes, meaning you'll have to be even more vigilant to make sure you're not caught off guard by other raiders or ARC. With all of this downside and struggles involved in heading Topside while hurricanes are raging the surface, you're probably wondering why it's worth the risk.</p>



<p>That upside comes in the form of valuable Raider caches that aren't just your average caches, but caches from the <strong>First Wave</strong>, which ARC Raiders lore-heads will recognize as caches from a bygone era, surely to be filled with valuable loot. We'll see what that loot looks like when the new map condition arrives this coming <strong>Tuesday, February 24, 2026.</strong></p>

			<p>We've been surprised by video game studio closures before, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"><strong>Xbox </strong>shut down <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> and <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>,</a> but this latest studio closure is arguably the most shocking one we've seen in a long time. <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, the studio responsible for the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> and decades of remakes and remasters across several iconic franchises, is being <strong>shut down by</strong> <strong>PlayStation</strong>.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> who broke the news that just <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-acquire-bluepoint-games/">five years after</a></strong> the studio officially joined the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> family, its remaining <strong>70 developers</strong> are losing their jobs in what is yet another baffling decision by PlayStation leadership.</p>



<p>"<em>Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,</em>" a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement, per Bloomberg's report. "<em>We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftsmanship</em>."</p>







<p>After the Demon's Souls Remake was one of the day-one launch titles for the release of the <strong>PS5</strong>, and the studio was officially brought under the PlayStation Studios banner, there was never an official confirmation as to what the studio was working on next. We knew it had done some co-development work on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, and beyond that, there were plenty of rumours and hopes. Bluepoint was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">popular choice for players to do a <strong>Bloodborne Remaster</strong></a> if that project were to ever actually happen.</p>



<p>The most reliable answer we have as to what the studio has been working on also came from a previous Bloomberg report, which was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live-service</strong> game that was cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. According to today's report from Bloomberg, following that project's cancellation, Bluepoint did its best to pitch future projects to <strong>Herman Hulst</strong> and the rest of PlayStation's top brass, none of which were accepted, it would seem.</p>



<p>As if this couldn't be any more tragic than it already was, the studio was celebrating its <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year, after being founded all the way back in <strong>2006</strong>. </p>
