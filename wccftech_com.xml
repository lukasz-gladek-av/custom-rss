			<p>Modder HalkHogan has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-nextgen-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a>, the final version of his texture overhaul for CD Projekt RED's next-gen version of the open world RPG masterpiece. According to HalkHogan, though, the improvement is far more extensive than just a texture upscale.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is a project created from the heart that improves and reworks a huge amount of game assets (textures, models, materials and more), and the number of these changes can be counted in thousands. Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent, and as faithful as possible, reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of The Witcher. Now you can experience the most beautiful adventure yet with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ultra quality detailed lore-friendly textures (many of them are reworked to 4K)</em></li>
<li><em>Implemented relief mapping on many surfaces, making them look much more realistic and 3D now</em></li>
<li><em>High quality smooth and more detailed models</em></li>
<li><em>Better object LODs (level of models details from distance) and increased draw distance for many objects</em></li>
<li><em>Specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked assets, that give the objects and surfaces a more realistic look</em></li>
<li><em>Everything consistent with the original CD Projekt RED artistic vision of The Witcher 3</em></li>
</ul>
