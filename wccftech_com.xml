			<p>Today, Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1892272985962402180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new major <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hades II</a> update called Warsong. The patch introduces the game's final confrontation, allowing protagonist Melinoë to fight all the way to the top of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits there. There's a new Olympian (the God of War) to meet, who has many blessings to bestow upon Melinoë; and the new (and final) animal companion that will help her in battle.</p>
<p>The developers introduced several powerful new boons and improved many existing ones. The Altar of Ashes has been overhauled, though, featuring updated effects and brand new artwork. Resource gathering has been revamped, too. Players can gather any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each tool; resource appearance rates have been adjusted as well.</p>
<p>Menu screens will feature new and enhanced animations. More importantly, the story has been greatly expanded thanks to over 2,000 new voice lines, including new dialogue events for many characters.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, Psyche can no longer be found as a location reward; bones can now be found earlier instead. All Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style health bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of the player's spells. Any damage resistance effects the player has will no longer affect any armor they have. Furthermore, the requirements for certain key events have been adjusted; as a result, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p>
<p>The Warsong update also adds new foes, locations, and Chaos Trials (the Trial of Thunder, a Zeus-themed Trial set in Erebus; the Trial of Glory: a Hera-themed Trial set on Olympus; the Trial of the Fall: a Demeter-themed Trial set in the Mourning Fields; the Trial of Slaughter: an Ares-themed Trial set in Ephyra; the Trial of Destiny: a Chaos-themed Trial set on Olympus; and the Trial of Strife: an Eris-themed Trial set in Thessaly) to Hades II.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games confirmed that plans are already underway for the third big update, and the 1.0 launch, while still some time away, is getting closer.</p>
