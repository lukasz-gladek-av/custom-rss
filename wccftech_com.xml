			<p>Earlier today, when we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/">Billbil-kun's report on Dealabs</a> that leaked a few of the games coming to the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue, we wrote that the official announcement probably wasn't too far behind, and that if it didn't appear today, it would surely appear before the end of the week. Well, we were right the first time, as a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-silent-hill-2-until-dawn-v-rising-yakuza-like-a-dragon-and-more/">PlayStation Blog post</a> confirmed most of the Dealabs report, with some additional announcements not in the report.</p>



<p>Starting off, yes, Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake is the big headlining game for PS Plus Extra for October 2025. It's also joined by the 2024 version of Until Dawn, V Rising, and As Dusk Falls, as we saw in the earlier report. Dealabs also got one of the PS Plus Premium games right coming into the Classics Catalogue with the original PlayStation version of Tekken 3 entering the service. Everything will also arrive, as predicted, next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>



<p>What we didn't see in the Dealabs report is that Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1, and Wizard with a Gun are also joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue this month. Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium this month.</p>



<ul>
<li>Silent Hill 2 Remake - PS5</li>



<li>Until Dawn (2024) - PS5</li>



<li>V Rising - PS5</li>



<li>Yakuza: Like a Dragon - PS5, PS4</li>



<li>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 - PS5, PS4</li>

<p>Looking at the full lineup of PS Plus games for October, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/">between Alan Wake 2</a>, Silent Hill 2 Remake, V Rising, Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1, and Until Dawn (2024), it's a more than solid lineup of horror-themed games for this time of year. </p>
