			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/">Honor of Kings: World</a> is a new spin on the widely successful mobile MOBA, Honor of Kings, which is consistently one of the most played games across the entire planet. World brings the mobile series directly to PC alongside its mobile version, and players will get their first chance to try it out at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>TiMi Studio has announced that it will be at Gamescom later this month with a demo of Honor of Kings: World in hand, and if you'll be at Gamescom in just a couple of weeks from the time of this writing, then make sure to head over to Hall 9, Booth B040 to check out the PvP and PvE gameplay that'll be featured in World.</p>



<p>Unlike the original Honor of Kings game, World is not a MOBA, but a multiplayer adventure RPG, and plays significantly differently from the mobile MOBA. </p>

<p>While this is the first time the general public will get the chance to try out Honor of Kings: World, Wccftech and other members of the press got the chance to try it out earlier this year at GDC. Even though it was just a small slice of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto and Alessio Palumbo still walked away impressed</a> from what they played and saw.</p>



<p>"<em>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the tactical role-playing game developed by Necrosoft Games and published by Ysbryd Games, will launch next month on PC and consoles after being delayed indefinitely last year.</p>



<p>As announced during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan, the game will launch on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Serie S, and Nintendo Switch. To celebrate the announcement, a new short trailer was also shared, showcasing some of the fifteen playable characters, all with unique fighting styles, the game's retro graphics, the battle system, and more. You can find the trailer below.</p>

<p>Demonschool has been in development for quite some time, and at one point, it looked like work on the game had stopped.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/">Last year</a>, however, the game was relaunched with a playable demo that did an amazing job showcasing its unique premise and, most of all, its excellent battle system. You can learn more about it in my preview.</p>



<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>



<p>Demonschool launches on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
