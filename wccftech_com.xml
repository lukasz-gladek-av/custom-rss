			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox's Summer Showcase</a> this coming Sunday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/05/xbox-game-pass-june-2025-wave-1/?ocid=XGP_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_6.5.1">Microsoft has confirmed</a> 10 games that will be making their way to Xbox Game Pass during the month of June, including a mix of games that will be available on Game Pass on their launch day, and older games that are finally making their way onto the service.</p>
<p>Regarding what's available right now, two classic RPGs are being added to the service today, the first two Baldur's Gate games. The Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are available on Xbox Game Pass console and cloud today, with the other eight games spread throughout the month.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-release-date-has-been-announced-june-13-2025/">The Alters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-launching-in-summer-2025-demo-available-on-steam/">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> are all launching into Game Pass and will be available in the service from day-one, while other notable entries into Game Pass this month include <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>, and Kingdom: Two Crowns.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of everything coming to Game Pass this month, and when they'll be available.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Microsoft also confirmed seven games that will be leaving Xbox Game Pass this month on June 15, 2025. Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dordogne - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Isonzo - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Keplerth - PC</li>
<li>My Time at Sandrock - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Depersonalization - PC</li>
</ul>
<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>
