While the report looks at Sony's entire operation, including the television and music businesses, the observations on the company's <strong>Gaming Division</strong> are the most interesting.</p>



<p>For the third quarter, Sony's results are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"expected to beat market expectations, driven by sales of both in-house and third-party games."</em> These results will likely make it easier for Sony to extend the current console generation, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Sony expects the PlayStation 5's lifecycle to be extended</em>, with the <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">PlayStation 6 likely to be </em><em>"</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">delayed longer than many expected."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a delay of the next console generation</strong> isn't something we are hearing this month for the first time, the prediction coming from an expert analyst definitely gives more weight to the prospect. However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a longer delay into 2029/2030</strong> or even beyond would make the scenario very peculiar for the console industry, as Sony, and possibly Microsoft, would be sitting on hardware that will be outdated by 2030. </p>



<p>This wouldn't be completely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unprecedented</strong>, given that the Nintendo Switch 2 successfully launched in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/"><strong>later than even NVIDIA expected</strong></a>, and without cutting-edge technology, but it would still be new for both Sony and Microsoft. And under current conditions, it will likely be preferable to delay new systems rather than release them at a very high price that wouldn't make them compelling to the price-savvy console audience.</p>

			<p>Just over a week ago, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared with <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> fans a first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> as <strong>Lara Croft</strong> in the upcoming TV series adaptation, which recently started principal photography.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview with the LA Times</a> for another Prime Video show (<strong>Steal</strong>, a six-episode limited series available now for streaming), Turner spoke a little about her version of the beloved English adventurer and archeologist. She clarified that she and the showrunners are focusing on Lara's extraordinary skill set rather than her sexy appearance, unlike previous games and even the movies starring Angelina Jolie, which didn't shy away from it.</p>



<p><em>My Lara is not a sex bombshell. It's about her and her story and what drives her, rather than what so many people also love about her, which is how hot she is in the games and the movies. But I really want to show the other side. She’s so unashamedly capable. She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, the actress, who got her breakthrough role as <strong>Sansa Stark</strong> in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> and was also a main character (<strong>Jean Grey</strong>) in <strong>X-Men's Dark Phoenix</strong>, says she never trained as hard for any role as she did for Lara Croft's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series. </p>



<p><em>I now really feel like I could protect them [<strong>Editor’s Note: she's referring to her kids</strong>]. As a mum, I come up with scenarios in my head, and I’m like, ‘OK, if a man jumped out of here, what would I do?’ And it’s always like, ‘I just pick the kids up and run. But now it’s changed. My instinct would be to deck him in the face.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve never had to train for anything like this before. In ‘X-Men’, we had to be in good shape, but my character was telekinetic, so I didn’t need to do much. I didn’t realize I could push my body that far. I feel like I’ve achieved something even before we’ve started shooting.</em></p>



<p>Truthfully, even the most recent Tomb Raider reboot trilogy started moving away from Lara Croft's previously inherent sexiness. We'll see if that continues with the next game iteration, <strong>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development at <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and scheduled to launch in <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>
