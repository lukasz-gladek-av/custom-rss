			<p>Poncle, the team behind the hit and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">award-winning auto-shooter</a> Vampire Survivors, has announced its next published title, Kill the Brickman, developed by Doonutsaur at Gamescom 2025, and it has also launched it on PC and Xbox at the same time.</p>



<p>The one-minute announcement and release trailer for Kill the Brickman mostly showed off gameplay of this Brick-Breaker-like game, before ending the presentation with a slew of Steam codes that, as far as we can tell, were quickly snatched up by anyone who was fast enough while watching the live stream.</p>



<p>Though, even if you missed grabbing a free code, Kill the Brickman is not an expensive game, and at the time of this writing you can grab it for only $4.49 USD with a 10% off launch sale that will end on August 28, 2025. It'll be back to $4.99 USD / EUR4.99 / Â£3.99 after the 28th.</p>

<p>More than just a brick-breaker game, Kill the Brickman is described as a "<em>turn-based, rogue-like bullet builder from outer space</em>."</p>



<p>The collaboration between Poncle and Doonutsaur began when the game was sent to Poncle over email, and the studio's director, Luca Galante, became immediately enamored with it. "<em>Yes, this is true. I love Bricks</em>," Galante said in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>Kill the Brickman is not only a brilliant deckbuilder, it's also one of the strangest ones I've ever played. And that's a good thing</em>."</p>



<p>Galante is right in that Kill the Brickman seems like a strange game in a positive way. And there's no waiting to test that theory, since for the price of an expensive coffee, you can play Kill the Brickman on your PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S console, right now. There was no mention of a PlayStation or Nintendo version, though there's always a possibility those could be added down the road. </p>
