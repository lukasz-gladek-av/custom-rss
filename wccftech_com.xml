			<p>Today, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-572-60-fix-black-screen-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a new GeForce Game Ready driver</a> optimized for the latest NARAKA: BLADEPOINT update. The highly popular melee focused free-to-play Battle Royale game by 24 Entertainment now supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, allowing players to achieve astounding frame rates on the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>
<p>Leading the pack is the flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. According to NVIDIA benchmarks, it can run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at an average of nearly 600 frames per second (yes, you've read that right) at 4K resolution and maximum graphics settings with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. That's a massive uplift compared to the admittedly still more than sufficient 150 frames per second that the card can achieve without DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The GeForce RTX 5080 achieves only a little more than half the average frame rate of its bigger sibling, 312 frames per second. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is fairly close at 255 average frames per second. At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen lets GeForce RTX 50 owners run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at even more mind-boggling frame rates: 737, 536, and 450 FPS at 1440P and 933, 727, and 642 FPS at 1080P.</p>
<p>The latest game update also optimizes character grappling hook resources to provide a smoother experience when using it. In-game 'loot memory' was also optimized, improving memory recovery after combat to reduce memory consumption. Content-wise, 24 Entertainment added a new hero called Ziping Yin to the Showdown mode.</p>

<p>NVIDIA also revealed that the new DLSS 4 plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to game developers, allowing them to access the latest and greatest transformer models for optimal image quality.</p>
<p>As a roundup of the latest PC game releases with integrated DLSS technologies, the racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is out with support for Frame Generation and Super Resolution, while the roguelite first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287150/Revenge_of_the_Mage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenge of the Mage</a> launched last month in early access with Super Resolution support.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will debut with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and ray-traced reflections; on the same day, PGA TOUR 2K25 will be released with DLSS Super Resolution.</p>

			<p>11 bit studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has revealed</a> its new revised roadmap for Frostpunk 2, a game that was released in September last year. Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>
