			<p><strong>NetEase Games</strong> is getting set to launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-joins-roster-season-6-the-game-awards-2025/">Season 6: Night at the Museum</a></strong> of <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> this coming <strong>Friday, January 16, 2026</strong>, which includes the introduction of the game's latest duelist, everyone's favourite merc with a mouth, <strong>Deadpool</strong>.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">Season 5 introduced Rogue and Gambit</a>, Season 6 will start with Deadpool, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow at the halfway point. As NetEase does with every new season, ahead of its launch, the studio has debuted a gameplay trailer showing off the new hero's skills, with today's trailer showcasing Deadpool's lethal arsenal and the various ways in which players can take advantage of his skills.</p>

<p>More than just a Duelist, Deadpool is actually a triple-threat hero. He's a Duelist, a Strategist, and a Vanguard. You can also unlock upgrades for his skills mid-game to make him even more deadly. With all of that built into one character, it's not surprising that in Quick mode games and Competitive mode games, there can only be one Deadpool on either side.</p>



<p>Along with Deadpool entering as the new character for the first half of Season 6, NetEase is introducing a significant update to the Hero Proficiency system. "<em>The cap will be raised for each hero and new rewards added such as Units, Unstable Molecules, Nameplates, Titles, Nameplate Frames, Badges, Dynamic Avatars, and more</em>," writes NetEase in a press release. </p>



<p>Season 6 also introduces a photo mode to Times Square, and Times Square will also be getting a new area called the Clobberin' Club, where you can challenge other players to duels. Then, on January 29, the Museum of Contemplation map will be introduced.</p>

<p>And as always, there are plenty of bug fixes and balance changes that are coming with the new season, though those will be <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">revealed in the full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>This is the season that is kicking off 2026 for NetEase Games and Marvel Rivals, and if NetEase is to be believed, 2026 will be the year that the studio really shows how much it can grow its third-person hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">after calling 2025 a "<em>warm-up</em>."</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Is CODE VEIN II a Numbered Sequel in a Different World? Bandai Namco Explains Time Travel and the Rebuilt Partner System]]></title>

			<p>More than six years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the release of the first game</a>, <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> returns with <strong>CODE VEIN II</strong>, the sequel to the Soulslike action RPG that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-shipped-over-3-million-copies-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over three million copies</a></strong> across all platforms. While not a smashing success, the game undoubtedly garnered a sizable following. However, the developers are still making changes to several aspects in this new iteration; for instance, it is set in a completely different world with new characters. The first CODE VEIN also allowed co-op multiplayer, whereas this new entry focuses on expanding the Partner System that powers AI companions.</p>



<p>Following a recent press event <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where we went hands-on with the game</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled <strong>January 30</strong> launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, we sent a few questions to Bandai Namco Studios to uncover more details about CODE VEIN II. The answers were provided by CODE VEIN II producer <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong>-san and game director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>-san. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-character-creator-demo-release-date-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Character Creator demo will be released on January 23</a>, one week before the full game's debut.</p>

<p><strong>What were some of the challenges your team faced when it came to overhauling the combat and giving it more impact in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> In the previous game, players opted to play without a partner to focus solely on combat. To give players the option to explore alongside a partner while focusing on enemy encounters, <strong>we’ve introduced a new “Assimilation” mechanic to the partner system in this installment</strong>.</p>



<p>We rebuilt the partner system from scratch to ensure players can choose between the traditional “Summoning” mechanic and the newly added “Assimilation” mechanic, while also incorporating cooperative elements such as the Restorative Offering mechanic.</p>



<p><strong>If Code Vein II is in a separate universe with no connections to the first title, why go with a numbered sequel rather than calling it something different?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura: </strong>This second installment in the series continues the core concept of CODE VEIN: challenging, exploration-focused action alongside a partner character. By introducing time travel and the idea of intervening in a character's past, we felt that we could powerfully depict the drama of two species—humans and Revenants—living in different timelines.</p>



<p><strong>However, we also considered that if players experience returning to the past and altering it, and then ultimately encounter the continuation point of the previous game, they might feel the urge to intervene in that world as well. We felt that if we allowed this, it would negate the lives of the characters from the previous game, and the stories players experienced themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Considering these points, we ultimately decided to create a new story in a world distinct from the previous one. For these reasons, while this is the second installment in the series, it depicts a story set in a different world.</p>



<p><strong>What was the design philosophy your team had in mind when it came to creating the levels and encounters in CODE VEIN II? Is this intended to be more difficult than the original title?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> We've taken care to prevent unreasonable melee encounters from occurring, allowing players to stay focused on combat. Even when group battles do occur, this game features an enemy group-behavior control system that maintains a satisfying level of challenge while letting players enjoy the back-and-forth combat against enemies.</p>



<p><strong>How much player agency will there be when it comes to the time travel? Can players choose not to change events in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura:</strong> Travel between the present and past worlds is relatively unrestricted. Even while progressing the story in the past, you can return to the present world and explore it. <strong>As the story advances, you will encounter several major turning points where you must choose whether to return to the past.</strong> At these points, it is possible to advance the story without intervening in the past more than necessary.</p>



<p><strong>How many routes/endings will there be in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> While we can’t share specific numbers, we can say that <strong>the game includes multiple scenario branches and endings</strong> that reflect the choices and changes players make throughout their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
