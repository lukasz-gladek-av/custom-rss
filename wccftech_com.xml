			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1976774165207060716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1976774165207060716%7Ctwgr%5E189fd63311bfa1ba40ae994f5c95a230fe717dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Fglen-powell-wants-a-part-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-movie-1616433%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> during this weekend's New York Comic-Con 2025, Hollywood star Glen Powell revealed that he has been playing (and enjoying) Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a lot lately, and he'd like to be in the movie, too.</p>



<p><em>Expedition 33 is one of that I've become a fan of. If there's an Expedition 33 movie, I'd be very interested.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear whether Glen Powell is aware that a live action adaptation of the game was announced in January 2025, before the game's launch (which happened on April 24). The film will be produced by Story Kitchen, formerly known as dj2 Entertainment, a production company focused specifically on adapting game IPs. They already have experience with the successful Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and also have signed deals to bring many other franchises to the big and small screen, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, Sifu, and Vampire Survivors.</p>



<p>Casting for the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 movie is yet to be announced. Of course, Glen Powell would be a big get. Following his roles in Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man, Anyone but You, Twisters, and Chad Powers, Powell is now one of the top leading actors in Hollywood. His next appearances will be in The Running Man, an Edgar Wright-directed film adapted from the 1982 dystopian novel by Stephen King, and Ghostwriter, J.J. Abrams' next fantasy movie.</p>



<p>Can Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive afford him, though? Sure, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has surpassed five million copies sold, which is certainly much more than they were expecting. </p>



<p>At any rate, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-future-update-to-add-new-location-costumes-and-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are preparing a free update</a> that will add new late game bosses and a brand new location to explore to the game. This will be a thank-you for the whole community.</p>

			<p>[<strong>Update</strong> - October 13, 7:34 AM EDT] <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/wukong/news/detail?id=235">The October 13 Black Myth Wukong update notes are now live</a>, confirming the list of changes and improvements hitting all versions of the game today, including some optimization changes on PlayStation 5 that address some of the most notable issues. On PC, the update also introduces AMD FSR 4 support, an improved Compatible Mode, improved lighting quality for Global Illumination Low setting, and more. Original story follows.</p>



<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] A new Black Myth: Wukong update is going live today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, introducing vital bug fixes and performance optimizations.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed by developer Game Science on the series' <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame">official X profile</a>. The developer also issued a warning for PC players, informing them that, due to a considerable number of underlying changes, installed mods may cause compatibility and stability issues. As such, Game Science suggests uninstalling the mods and verifying the integrity of game files before restarting the game if any issue arises.</p>



<p>Game Science also warned players that due to differences in file storage methods, the patch for the PlayStation 5 version will require a large amount of free storage space, approximately 93.5 GB. If the user cannot free enough space, the developer suggests continuing to play the game's current version.</p>



<p>Final update notes for the new Black Myth: Wukong patch have yet to be shared. We will update the post once the update starts rolling out and all the details are made public. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Destined Ones,<br>A new update for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a> is on the way. In addition to regular bug fixes, it will also include some performance optimizations.</p><p>Due to a considerable number of underlying changes, we'd like to remind you of the following:<br>1.Installed mods may cause… <a href="https://t.co/UYJTMgw8lw">pic.twitter.com/UYJTMgw8lw</a></p></div>— Black Myth (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1977192496716517644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong launched on PC and PlayStation 5 in August 2024, so it’s definitely good news to hear that Game Science hasn't left the game behind, even following the announcement of the next entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>. Hopefully, these performance optimizations will be significant, as the game is still in dire need of them, especially on consoles, whose visuals and performance are impacted by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/">unusual development choices</a>.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about this solid soulslike by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">checking out my review</a>.</p>

			<p>RTX Remix modder xoxor4d has released an initial compatibility build for Rockstar's GTA 4, providing a glimpse at the 2008 game with path traced graphics. ResetEra user gabdeg was able to test the RTX Remix build (which is currently only available to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xoxor4d's Patreon</a> subscribers at the Chocolate Strawberry Advocate Tester tier - $10 monthly - or above) and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-rtx-remix-released-up-3-13-25-out-of-beta.808098/post-146333869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a few screenshots</a>, which they said don't really do justice to the degree to which GTA 4's visuals are improved with path tracing, and that's without changing any of the game's default textures. We have added them to the gallery below.</p>

<p>xoxor4d previously managed to make several popular games compatible with RTX Remix, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-4-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Portal 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. Their work on the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD</a>, a build specifically dedicated to remaking the No Mercy campaign.</p>



<p>On the RTX Remix Compatibility Mods Discord, xoxor4d provided additional details for those interested in running the game:</p>



<p><em>As for the game version, the very latest Complete Edition (1.2.0.59) from either Steam or Rockstar Games is required. It should work fine on both versions, but I suggest using the RS version of the game as the Steam one has a few problems of its own (especially when running the game in windowed mode - if you plan on running fullscreen anyway, use Steam). It’s compatible with Fusion Fix, but can also lead to certain issues. I’ll eventually compile and ship a version of Fusion Fix that is specifically tailored to the RTX Remix compatibility mod.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fusion Fix</a> is a popular GTA 4 mod that fixes various issues and adds features like a Field of View slider, toggling effects such as motion blur and bloom, setting an FPS limiter, and more.</p>



<p>According to xoxor4d, the public release for the RTX Remix compatibility mod will not be available before the end of this month.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-products-arent-being-removed-target-walmart/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-products-aren%E2%80%99t-being-removed-by-target-and-walmart-despite-rumors-to-the-contrary.1323310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over this weekend, several Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1o4b1w7/my_local_target_is_getting_rid_of_their_xbox/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.cbr.com/target-removes-xbox-series-stores-trump-tariff-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Target and Walmart, two of the largest retailers in the United States, were effectively removing Xbox products from physical stores. The report caught like wildfire among the Xbox fanbase, especially following the previous news that another big retailer, Costco, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already done just that last month</a>.</p>



<p>However, eventually, other reports to the contrary started appearing on the Web by sources like YouTuber Destin Legarie, who <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1977486029960732978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>I just called my local Walmart to ask if they were discontinuing or pulling Xbox stock. They said, "at least to my knowledge, I haven't heard anything about clearing inventory or anything like that. Or about being discontinued." They also said they still have them in stock.</em> <em>I also called Target to ask if they were pulling or discontinuing Xbox stock. The person working there told me… "There's nothing in our system showing anything being discontinued. But we also haven't had a shipment in about a week. It says we have the next one on October 19th, but just for 1. Nothing is saying discontinued."</em></p>



<p>Windows Central also <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conducted its own investigation</a> and later even managed to get Microsoft to comment on the issue with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft appears to always be rushing to extinguish some kind of PR fire. Then again, it is largely its own fault, for its constant strategy shifts have baffled the Xbox fanbase to the point where they are willing to believe any kind of rumor.</p>



<p>Following many studio closures and layoff rounds, the latest blow to the Xbox brand's reputation came in the form of the massive Xbox Game Pass restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced last week</a>. The Ultimate tier suffered a huge 50% price hike, and the new middle tier, called Premium, won't ever get Call of Duty games. All this was even more egregious after executives had boasted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass was already profitable</a> and had just reached a new revenue record in the last fiscal year.</p>



<p>Needless to say, users assaulted the Xbox Game Pass cancellation page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelming it with requests for a while</a>. Analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are worried that the damage to the brand might be lasting</a>, especially because of the sense of broken trust.</p>
