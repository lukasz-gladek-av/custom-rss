			<p>Over a year after its debut on PC, Shift Up's Stellar Blade will finally release on PC in a few months, alongside new DLC.</p>
<p>During yesterday's State of Play presentation, the Korean studio confirmed that the action game will launch on PC this June. Following the announcement, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam store page</a> also went live, but it sadly did not reveal any additional information on the PC version or the system requirements.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the PC version of Stellar Blade will be accompanied by the launch of a new GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE DLC, which, much like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/">NieR Automata DLC</a> released last year, will bring two different franchises together in an explosive collaboration. You can check out the new DLC in action in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and will launch on PC this June. You can learn more about the excellent action game by Shift Up in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title, and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 is doing great on the market and has sold an impressive number of units in the past quarter, bringing its total units sold well past the 60 million units point.</p>
<p>In Sony's latest financial report covering the third quarter of the current fiscal year, it has been confirmed that the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter to date in terms of sales, having sold 9.5 million units, bringing the total of units sold to 75 million. In terms of software sales, Sony reported 96 million units sold, a solid increase over the 89.7 million units sold during the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. Both hardware and software sales contributed to the record operating profits in the third quarter of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of user engagement, the PlayStation 5 is also doing quite well. 42% of new console purchases have come from new users, bringing the total number of active users to 129 million users, which Sony is looking to increase further by diversifying its lineup with family and live service games. Regarding new releases, it was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-q3-ond-fy3-2025-financial-results-hw-9-5m-sw-95m-ltd-75m.1107987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that both Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are still scheduled for a 2025 release, which is definitely reassuring, considering both did not make an appearance during yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play presentation.</a></p>
<p>The full detailed report, which goes over other Sony business segments besides PlayStation, can be found <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf">here.</a></p>
