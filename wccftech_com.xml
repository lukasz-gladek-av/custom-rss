			<p>The three PS Plus Essential-tier games that subscribers can add to their library for free with their subscriptions for July 2025 have been announced, headlined by Diablo IV, and supported by Jusant and King of Fighters XV.</p>
<p>Along with these games being part of PlayStation's monthly routine to add more games to its PS Plus service, they're also part of the company's celebrations for the 15-year anniversary of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which launched on June 29, 2010.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>"<em>We hope you can join us for a number of celebratory activities we have planned this summer to commemorate this incredible milestone,</em>" wrote Nick Maguire, vice president of global services, global sales, and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-a-big-thank-you-to-players-for-15-wonderful-years/">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV will all be available for PS Plus subscribers beginning on July 1, though there are more benefits and discounts subscribers can take advantage of this week as part of the PlayStation Plus anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>One of the more notable aspects of the celebrations is that this weekend, June 28-29 will be another free online multiplayer weekend, where all PlayStation players, whether they have a PS Plus subscription or not, will be able to hop online and play with their friends.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits are exclusive to the PS Plus Premium tier, with Premium subscribers getting access to a 15% discount on films available through the Sony Pictures Core app. Premium subscribers also get access to a Monster Hunter Wilds game trial and a WWE 2K25 game trial.</p>
<p>All PS Plus subscribers will get access to a weekend offer of discounts on the PlayStation Store, and be able to download a Valorant PS Plus Pack which includes cosmetics that players can show off in their Valorant matches.</p>
<p>That's all Maguire shared on the PS Blog for now, though there will be more to come throughout the month of July, beyond the announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium-tier monthly additions. Maguire also points players to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/whats-new/#15th">PlayStation Plus section</a> of the PlayStation website to find out more about the 15 year anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>"<em>In the last 15 years we have been focused on providing access to quality game experiences through PlayStation Plus, along with key benefits such as exclusive PlayStation Store discounts, online multiplayer access, Cloud Game Streaming and more. Since the launch of our Monthly Games benefit (previously known as Instant Game Collection), more than 500 monthly games have been offered.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for coming on our PlayStation Plus journey. There's plenty more to look forward to, including many more great games to come</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new big patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.5. This update introduces major fixes to the A-Life system, which was kinda broken when STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view. Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.</em></li>
<li><em>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.</em></li>
<li><em>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.</em></li>
<li><em>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are many more bug fixes, tweaks, and technical improvements to performance and Ultra-wide screens, for instance, but arguably the other highlight of STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 is the public release of the modding tool. Called Zone Kit, it is available for download <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a> and will allow users to create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and more. The mods can then be shared via Steam Workshop or <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mod.io</a>. The former page isn't up yet, but Mod.io already has 43 mods listed.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Wccftech that they would add cross-platform mods, multiplayer, and hardware ray tracing post-launch. The first one has been released, and now we're expecting them to focus on delivering the remaining promises made to fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition RealityV mod is now available for download, introducing some very welcome improvements as well as some features that are already available in the Legacy version of the mod.</p>
<p>The 3.1 version introduces the 8K Milky Way night time sky and stars from the Legacy version of the game, improved FSR for a cleaner image and better edge detection, improved TAA which should show less ghosting, improved weather variety with a reduction in the frequency of rain, improved dusk sky colors for clear and extra sunny weather, improved exposure color shift and color correction which should improve how ray tracing looks and more. The new version of the mod, as well as some screenshots showcasing the improvements outlined above, can be found on the mod's creator, BadassBaboon's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/realityv-for-gta-132248613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page.</a></p>
<p>Following its launch earlier this year, Rockstar Games has continued working on Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, releasing a few patches that introduce some welcome improvements. The latest patch was launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-patch-new-ray-tracing-settings/">last week</a>, introducing two new ray tracing options on PC that enable ray-traced reflections and a second ray bounce for ray-traced global illumination.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. It features the same improvements seen in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, as well as additional ray tracing features. A Legacy version of the game continues to be available on Steam, allowing users with older systems to play the game without the new ray tracing features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Atomic Heart developer Mundfish unveiled several games, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sequel to AH</a>, an online multiplayer spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cube</a>), and a survival horror game they will publish (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ill-is-an-intriguing-survival-horror-published-by-atomic-heart-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILL</a>).</p>
<p>As you might recall, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-final-q-fsr-2-confirmed-old-consoles-will-be-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish often ahead of the launch of Atomic Heart. Now that the studio's new phase has begun, we reached out once again to the Founder, CEO, and Game Director, Robert Bagratuni, to learn more about all these projects. We're starting today with Atomic Heart 2, arguably the most anticipated one, given that it's the sequel to a highly successful title that <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> over 10 million players.</p>
<p>The good news is that it's clear the scope and the ambition are much higher. The bad news is that we won't get to play it for a rather long while, although that's not too surprising given that the first installment only launched two years ago. Anyway, keep scrolling below to read the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Hello, Robert. Can you tell us when Atomic Heart 2 takes place exactly in the timeline? Can you share which ending of the original will be followed canonically?</strong></p>
<p>Atomic Heart 2 takes place a few years after the conclusion of the first game, picking up the thread following the fallout and DLCs, but in a fresh chapter of the story. The sequel follows the aftermath of the original’s multiple endings, including the upcoming fourth DLC, which will bring more clarity to that matter. We are staying true to the beautiful dystopian world of science and technology, but expanding into broader retro‑futuristic environments across the globe, with a world shaped by previous upheavals and consequences of the first game’s events.</p>
<p><strong>Some users have noticed a more Western vibe from the trailer. Will that be reflected in the actual game? If so, can you expand on this?</strong></p>
<p>We’re definitely not abandoning the art direction and atmosphere that players loved in the first game. The retro-futuristic, dystopian world of Atomic Heart is still very much intact, and music remains a powerful part of how we express it.</p>
<p>Choosing Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now for the announcement trailer wasn’t about changing direction, but about expanding the emotional range of the universe. Actually, that very track was released at the end of ‘70s in USSR on vinyl, as “КВИН – Не останавливай меня”. It’s exactly the kind of cultural crossover that fits into the Radio of the Future we’ve built, familiar yet reimagined through the lens of our world. And just like in the first game, there will be many tracks, many moods, and a mix of regional classics and global icons. If you remember how “Komarovo” and “Trava u doma” became iconic moments in Atomic Heart, rest assured, that spirit is alive and well in the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the trailer was gameplay and how much of it was cinematics?</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.</p>
<p>We’re focused on evolving the combat system with more variety, especially through the use of the glove’s abilities, intense encounters with enemies, and, of course, boss fights. You can see a bit more gameplay in the extended showcase we recently published on our official YouTube channel. As for the cinematics, we wanted to introduce some of the new characters players will meet, not all of whom will be clearly good or evil, and to show that the world itself is becoming more layered and diverse.</p>
<p><strong>Will Atomic Heart 2 include any multiplayer elements, or will those be reserved for The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>While Atomic Heart 2 focuses on a personal journey, The CUBE opens the door to a much broader, shared experience within the same retro-futuristic dystopia. The CUBE is a narrative spin-off, but not a side project. It’s a massive MMO RPG shooter that takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. It expands the universe both narratively and structurally. The Cube itself, as a literal, mysterious megastructure, is a key part of the lore. It's a fully integrated piece of the timeline, not just a multiplayer layer. Players will explore this shifting world, uncover its secrets, and interact with systems and consequences born directly out of the Atomic Heart games.</p>
<p><strong>Is P-3 coming back? Will there be any other playable characters in AH2?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve watched the trailer closely, you may have spotted P-3 and some other familiar faces - so, yes, some key characters from the first part will return in Atomic Heart 2. That includes characters who survived the events of the original game and its DLCs. As for P-3 specifically… let’s just say his story isn’t over. But we’re not ready to reveal exactly how or in what capacity just yet. We’re not discussing playable characters in detail right now, but the story absolutely will continue threads that fans of the first game will recognize, while also opening new doors and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>The game world of this sequel seems much larger, as evidenced by the presence of vehicles and new traversal options. Can it be considered an open world? Will it feature dynamic day/time, weather, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Great question! This is something we’ve thought about a lot, especially after seeing players’ desire to explore the world in the first Atomic Heart. For example, we had this incredible flying city of Chelomey, which players were able to explore only once (not considering another opportunity in the DLC#3). We're paying close attention to all the feedback, so we know that the open world experience in AH1 wasn't perfect. And with Atomic Heart 2, we want to improve this significantly.</p>
<p>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</p>

<p><strong>You mentioned that AH2 will introduce an 'expanded RPG system' featuring a 'living world' and 'various activities'. Can you provide more information on all these aspects?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves - we will share more information when we are ready.</p>
<p>As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before.<br>
When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect.</p>
<p><strong>Will players make several choices leading to profound consequences for the various missions and the narrative? Are there companions in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Without giving too much away, we can say that Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</p>

<p><strong>You also briefly mentioned improvements to the combat system. What can we expect on that front?</strong></p>
<p>Combat was one of the aspects that players really connected with in Atomic Heart - the weight, the variety, the creative freedom in how you approached each fight. That positive feedback meant a lot to us, and it set a high bar for the sequel. With Atomic Heart 2, we want to go even further. To make sure we do it right, we’re starting internal playtesting much earlier this time around. Whether it’s moment-to-moment gunplay, skills usage, or how enemies react, our goal is to make every fight feel better, deeper, and more satisfying than before.</p>
<p><strong>What's the current state of the game? Prototype, Pre-Alpha? How long will it be until we can see more?</strong></p>
<p>The game is in active development and well past the prototype stage. We're a few years out from release, and taking the time to ensure everything feels tighter, polished, and more immersive. More updates will come as we hit key milestones.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
