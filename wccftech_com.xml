			<p><strong>Vampire Crawlers</strong>, the first spin-off of <strong>2022 indie sensation Vampire Survivors</strong>, will soon be available to play thanks to a free demo. Developer <strong>poncle</strong> announced that the demo will be released <strong>on February 23</strong> for <strong>PC </strong>via Steam (during next month's Steam Next Fest) and for <strong>Xbox</strong>. The full game will also be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, but there's no info on demos for those platforms.</p>



<p>The announcement comes alongside the first episode of a new video series called “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers”. The video series consists of <strong>bite-sized gameplay reveals</strong> in which the developer will share more about the features and gameplay of the upcoming rogue-like deckbuilding game.</p>



<p>In the debut episode, the team dives into the two key pillars of the Vampire Crawlers experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Turboturn</strong>: turn-based combat without the wait. In Vampire Crawlers, <strong>you can trigger your next move without having to wait for animations to finish</strong>. The game intelligently stacks and executes your ability inputs with precision, enabling you to play at your own chaotic pace. This, according to poncle, transforms tactical combat into a fast-paced, engaging, and visually rewarding experience.</li>



<li><strong>Card customization</strong>: discover endless ways to play your cards. <strong>Gems allow you to customise your cards with a variety of effects</strong>, ranging from raw damage multipliers to full weapon evolutions. Whether you're after a simple power boost or deep strategic planning, Gems provide every player with the tools to create game-breaking combos.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the heels of Vampire Survivors, which has sold an estimated ten million copies on Valve's platform alone, developer poncle has already convinced over 200K Steam users to wishlist Vampire Crawlers in the short span of two months since the game's announcement. Matching the incredible success of Survivors won't be easy, but the small indie team would likely be happy even with just a fifth of that.</p>

While the report looks at Sony's entire operation, including the television and music businesses, the observations on the company's <strong>Gaming Division</strong> are the most interesting.</p>



<p>For the third quarter, Sony's results are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"expected to beat market expectations, driven by sales of both in-house and third-party games."</em> These results will likely make it easier for Sony to extend the current console generation, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Sony expects the PlayStation 5's lifecycle to be extended</em>, with the <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">PlayStation 6 likely to be </em><em>"</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">delayed longer than many expected."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a delay of the next console generation</strong> isn't something we are hearing this month for the first time, the prediction coming from an expert analyst definitely gives more weight to the prospect. However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a longer delay into 2029/2030</strong> or even beyond would make the scenario very peculiar for the console industry, as Sony, and possibly Microsoft, would be sitting on hardware that will be outdated by 2030. </p>



<p>This wouldn't be completely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unprecedented</strong>, given that the Nintendo Switch 2 successfully launched in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/"><strong>later than even NVIDIA expected</strong></a>, and without cutting-edge technology, but it would still be new for both Sony and Microsoft. And under current conditions, it will likely be preferable to delay new systems rather than release them at a very high price that wouldn't make them compelling to the price-savvy console audience.</p>



<p>If the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PlayStation 5 generation is </strong><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extended beyond expectations</strong>&nbsp;and with</span> no change to the current situation, the outlook is dire for gamers. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The only things that are evolving constantly are the prices: they go up and up and up,</em>" said AshenWander on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sandstoneinsights-sony-expects-the-ps5-lifecycle-to-be-extended-ps6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected.1413673/post-150408820">ResetERA forums</a></strong>, echoing a good portion of the PlayStation community sentiment, torn between wanting to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">get their hands on the PlayStation 6 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">rumored handheld</a></strong>, and having to pay the <strong>exhorbitant price</strong> Sony would have to release it for with a launch within the next two to three years.</p>
