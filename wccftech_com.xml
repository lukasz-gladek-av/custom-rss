			<p>Chinese developer Invercity Game Works has unveiled a new survival action game titled Project Retrograde: The Becoming with a trailer published on IGN's YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The game looks heavily inspired by CAPCOM's survival horror franchise Resident Evil. Perhaps a little too much, in fact. Anyway, it's being developed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and there's no public release window yet. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nixinggame.com/en/invercity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> offers a basic overview of what players will find in Project Retrograde: The Becoming:</p>



<p><em>In 1995, humanity's last hope—Project Retrograde—collapsed as the underground world was shattered by the ancient parasite L.U.C.A. Play as a bounty hunter symbiotic with parasite, using its dangerous power to save the world, even if it consumes you.</em></p>



<p><em>Infected by L.U.C.A, you survive and gain the ability to absorb combat memories from other hosts. Unlock parasitic skills, become a Kung Fu master or the Baba Yaga, and experience adrenaline-fueled combat!</em></p>



<p><em>Delve into the post-apocalyptic realm filled with retro technology. Manipulate the LUX system to alter underground weather, or climb towers to reach unknown regions and uncover the truth buried for years.</em></p>
