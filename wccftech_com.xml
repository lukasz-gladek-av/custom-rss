			<p>Saber Interactive is officially making a new game based on one of Hasbro's big franchises. The news comes directly from Chris Cocks, formerly president of Wizards of the Coast and now CEO of parent company Hasbro (quote <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/20/hasbro-has-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Motley Fool</a>):</p>
<p><em>We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant about what it could be. Hasbro has several big franchises that could be adapted into a videogame: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, to name the most important ones. However, Transformers seems to be the most fitting for the developer behind the highly successful Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. There's already a G.I. Joe game starring Snake Eyes in development at Wizards of the Coast-owned developer Atomic Arcade, after all, and Dungeons and Dragons already has its own lineup: a co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Starbreeze</a> targeting a 2026 launch; a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Invoke</a>, formerly Tuque, developer of Dark Alliance; another game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Demeo developer Resolution Games</a>, now announced as <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/battlemarked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dungeons: Battlemarked</a>; and another game that Chris Cocks had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>Transformers fans, on the other hand, had to deal with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate at Splash Damage</a>. Plus, there's the fact that the studio's expertise seems much more suited to a shooter game rather than, say, a Magic: The Gathering game. Still, we'll have to wait and see. It might be a while before we learn more about this project.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Saber is also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok: Origins</a>, a triple-A RPG based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Jurassic Park Survival, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a> that was once in the hands of Aspyr. If that sounds like too much work, it's worth reminding that Saber is a massive company with many offices across the globe and nearly 2,700 employees.</p>

			<p>The second The Elder Scrolls VI news item of the week is a rarity, to be sure. After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-can-get-you-into-the-game-as-an-npc-for-a-meager-10-5k-and-upward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> of Bethesda's silent auction to work with the highest bidder on adding a non-player character (NPC) to the game, though, we have a much juicier rumor from extas1s on the game itself.</p>
<p>The leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY3Udvjn1Eo&amp;pp=ygUHZXh0YXMxcw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> info from a colleague who heard that major technical improvements will be made to the Creation Engine 2 seen in Starfield. These improvements could possibly reduce or eliminate load times between zones in an attempt to make the game feel more immersive. Needless to say, this would be a major boon to Bethesda's games, which have always had to deal with this shortcoming.</p>
<p>In terms of setting, the rumor confirms previous speculations that the game will take place in both Hammerfell and High Rock, the homes of the Redguards and Bretons, respectively. Interestingly, according to the source, The Elder Scrolls VI could feature between twelve and thirteen major cities, which would be a major step up from Skyrim, where there are only four or five that could really be considered that way.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing details reported is that the game will feature naval exploration, combat, and shipbuilding. This would be a transformed version of what we saw in Starfield, although of course, naval exploration and combat in the actual sea instead of space would be very different. Likewise, we might see the return of another feature seen in Starfield but originally introduced with Fallout 4: Settlements. Again, this would be expanded to allow players to build and customize villages and fortresses.</p>
<p>The character progression is said to be completely freeform, with improvements to the magic and melee combat systems. Lastly, dragons would be featured prominently, not only through boss encounters but also in the story.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unlikely part of the rumor is that we could see a teaser for The Elder Scrolls VI as early as this June, presumably at the Xbox Game Showcase, alongside the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored Oblivion remaster/remake</a>. This seems really farfetched, to be honest. Bethesda is known for only showing their games relatively close to release, and it's nowhere near time for that. Starfield only <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in September 2023, so realistically, The Elder Scrolls VI won't be released before 2027.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think of these details? Would you be happy if they were confirmed? Let us know in the comments.</p>
