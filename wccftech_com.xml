            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Bloober Team <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/report/espi-30-2025-wyniki-sprzedazy-gry-cronos-the-new-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed with a brief notice</a> that its new sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn has sold 200K units digitally in the first three days. It's not terrible, but it's not great, either, especially since the game was released on all major platforms, including the record-breaking console Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>It's way too early to spell doom for the Polish studio, anyway. CEO Piotr Babieno told <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-nie-widzi-zagrozenia-dla-Cronos-The-New-Dawn-w-zwiazku-z-debiutem-Hollow-Knight-Silksong-wywiad-9003011.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankier.pl</a> that the budget of Cronos: The New Dawn was lower than estimated by investors, which means it won't take that much to recoup the investment:</p>



<p><em>We also noticed that the costs of creating Cronos: The New Dawn were estimated at over PLN 100 million ($27.4 million). I can assure you that the development budget was certainly not that high, and even though we are counting on very good sales results, the break-even point is not as high as analysts indicate. We are completely confident about the company's investment growth and earnings. All our analyses indicate that things will be fine, but we will of course report on sales levels when we reach significant milestones.</em></p>



<p>Babieno also confirmed that there are no current plans for a sequel, although a transmedia expansion to cinema or TV is certainly possible. On the development side, Bloober is preparing even larger titles for the next couple of years, which Babieno believes will be even better than 2025 for the studio.</p>



<p>For those still on the fence for Cronos: The New Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here's our review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo, who thoroughly enjoyed the experience and rated it 8 out of 10.</p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-mode-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%98deep-of-night%E2%80%99-mode-is-out-now.1294446/</guid>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-high-difficulty-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> yesterday, FromSoftware has now released a free update for Elden Ring Nightreign, adding the brand new Deep of Night mode to the game.</p>



<p>This was designed as an endgame challenge for experienced players. Deep of Night can hide the Nightlord and Shifting Earth from players until battle begins. Enemies across Limveld will be more challenging, and random enemies will be mutated, potentially presenting greater dangers to players, who, however, can oppose these strengthened foes with new weapon enhancements. Beware, though, as some of these weapon enhancements could also have detrimental effects, such as increasing the amount of damage players take. </p>



<p>Players must be highly selective if they hope to survive the night and ultimately defeat the Nightlord. Three new relic slots have been introduced exclusively for Depths Relics, a new reward players can earn while playing the Deep of Night game mode. These Depths Relics can provide powerful enhancements, but, as with the new variant weapons, they also come at a cost. Victory will require skillful calculation and execution. Deep of Night mode is meant explicitly for the bravest Nightfarers, providing an extreme challenge and showing players the darkest depths of the game, including the dreadful possibility of unknowingly facing an Everdark Sovereign Nightlord.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is the latest in a series of successful game releases by FromSoftware. While not quite as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold five million units in the first month of its release</a>. Meanwhile, the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree reached 10 million units.</p>



<p>Even Hollywood noticed the franchise's popularity. In late May, a live-action film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>; it will be produced by A24 and Bandai Namco. Alex Garland, the man behind 28 Days Later, Dredd, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, and Warfare, is attached to direct and write the script. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-launches-november-4-powered-unity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-launches-on-november-4-powered-by-unity-and-featuring-big-improvements.1294416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SEGA and Sports Interactive have unveiled Football Manager 26 and its release date. The football management simulation game will be released on November 4 on PC and Mac, while Football Manager 26 Console launches simultaneously on Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, and PlayStation 5. FM26 and FM 26 Console will be available on PC and Xbox, respectively, to Game Pass subscribers on day one. November 4 will also mark the debut of Football Manager 26 Mobile as a Netflix exclusive. Lastly, Football Manager 2026 Touch will be released one month later digitally for the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>You may recall that last year's edition, Football Manager 25, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch on November 26</a> but was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> to double down on creating a better version for this year. Well, at least on paper, it appears to have paid off as there's a laundry list of new features.</p>



<p>Chiefly, there is the engine switch from Sports Interactive's proprietary engine to the widely used Unity engine. This allows for a much greater level of fidelity when spectating matches than before, thanks to new volumetric animations from real-life matches. Despite the engine change, FM26, FM26 Console, and FM26 Touch will all launch with save game compatibility for Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023.</p>



<p>The dated user interface has been refreshed to give players greater control and influence over make-or-break decisions in every career. Designed to be more intuitive for everyone from newcomers to veterans, the Football Manager 26 User Interface supports improvements in tactics, scouting, and recruitment. Another big addition is the long-awaited arrival of Women’s Football, which is seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem thanks to the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions that Sports Interactive and SEGA will reveal in the weeks ahead of November 4. Authenticity has been further enhanced, too, with the newly licensed Premier League taking the spotlight in this regard. </p>

<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said: </p>



<p><em>I’m honoured and delighted to be revealing Football Manager 26’s release date today. Setting Sports Interactive up for the next twenty years and beyond was an enormous undertaking but I couldn’t be prouder of the efforts of the whole team over the past two years. FM26 represents a landmark release in our quest to produce football management perfection and the whole studio is really excited to share it with the world.</em></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 can be pre-ordered now at £49.99/€59.99/$59.99, although select digital retailers provide a 10% discount. Lastly, PC and Mac users who pre-order through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/football-manager-26-080e85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> can look forward to two weeks of advanced access to the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Mode Gets Official Details; Testing Starts This Week on BF Labs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-gets-official-details-testing-starts-this-week-on-bf-labs.1294395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the Battlefield 6 development team <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> the long-rumored (and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-map-leaked-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a>) Battle Royale mode, which will begin testing this week via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs platform</a>. The goal is to infuse this highly popular game mode with Battlefield DNA, including destructible environments, classes, and more.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the map has been designed specifically for the Battle Royale experience. It features a diverse array of tactical points of interest, each with a distinct layout and theme that offers unique gameplay opportunities. During a Battle Royale match, players can find common vehicles around the map and eventually unlock powerful armored vehicles. The goal is to provide users with more ways to traverse the map early in a match and create interesting combined arms action, again playing to the trademark strength of the Battlefield franchise.</p>



<p>Destruction will include anything from creating pathways through walls all the way to toppling whole buildings, which is definitely something other Battle Royale games don't really have. The initial test will host a hundred players split into twenty-five squads of four, each vying to be the last squad standing. Communication tools include text, VoIP, and pings. To keep their squad alive, players can count on the Support class's revives and the Mobile Redeploy option.</p>



<p>The Battle Royale subgenre's defining feature is the ever-shrinking 'circle'. In Battlefield's twist, this will be a fire ring that instantly kills anything it touches, pushing players to always be inside it at a safe distance. In most other games of this kind, the circle merely damages players at a not-so-deadly rate, which players sometimes exploit to go around enemies and kill them. </p>



<p>Ahead of a Battlefield Battle Royale match, each squad selects the classes, another distinguishing feature compared to most games. The chosen class is not changeable during the matches. Players begin with two default gadgets from their class and level up during each match; XP is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Intel Cases will be a particularly juicy target since they provide experience to the whole squad. Leveling up a class provides access to new traits. For example, the Assault class can equip an armor plate faster.</p>



<p>Throughout a Battlefield Battle Royale match, players explore the map, complete missions, and battle for loot. There will be five rarity tiers of weapons to loot, as well as attachments, throwables, gadgets, strike packages, armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorite weapons. These items can be found in general or class-specific loot crates, by unlocking armored trucks, through mission rewards, or by looting defeated enemies.</p>



<p>The game will constantly assign missions to squads, asking them to complete objectives that offer extra rewards, giving them a competitive edge over their opponents. Tasks range from unlocking high-value caches to planting explosives to eliminate mission-critical targets. Mission details will include the available rewards, such as a weapons cache, vehicle key, or mobile redeploy unit. Once the mission objective is complete, the rewards are airdropped in, which means other squads may swoop in and steal them if those who earned the rewards aren't careful.</p>



<p>While the developers are focused on delivering the core Battlefield 6 experience first on October 10, it is clear that a well-received Battle Royale mode could make all the difference in reaching <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA's lofty goal of 100 million players</a>. Once ready, this mode might be released as a standalone and free experience, just like Warzone is to Call of Duty, but it's too early to say for sure at this stage.</p>
