			<p>KONAMI announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Hunt</a>, the multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, will be available sometime in the Fall season. However, there's also some bad news: the official Japanese account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1955585126286377462%7Ctwgr%5E73386f46dba965f7676b994d8eff39cf2cc05419%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that there will be no crossplay in Fox Hunt. </p>



<p>This is less than ideal, to say the least, especially for a multiplayer mode that launches after launch. Most players might have already forgotten about it by the time Fox Hunt becomes available. Some fans are already worried that the mode could be 'dead on arrival', although that's way too early to say. </p>



<p>Fox Hunt has been heavily inspired by the fan-favorite Metal Gear Online, as outlined in the mode's official description: </p>



<p><em>A thrilling, hide-and-seek-based, completely original online multiplayer experience. This unique Metal Gear online experience utilizes the central elements of the base game: camouflage and survival.</em></p>



<p><em>It is based on the Sneaking rule from METAL GEAR ONLINE. It utilizes the fundamentals of one of the most popular game rules from METAL GEAR ONLINE, as well as the iconic sneaking gameplay elements of the METAL GEAR series. The latest graphical enhancements amplify the tension of hide-and-seek to a whole new level.</em></p>



<p>Still, this is really just an extra. The main course will be the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, which fans of the series have been waiting for a long time. Developed with the help of Virtuos (which also took care of the Oblivion Remaster) in Unreal Engine 5, MGS: Delta Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to debut in exactly two weeks</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game features a few quality-of-life improvements, such as a modern control scheme (although the original is optionally available, too), but the original's core experience remains intact. We'll soon learn if it stands the test of time.</p>
