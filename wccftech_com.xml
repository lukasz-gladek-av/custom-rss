			<p>Obsidian has <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1923067990796361892">announced</a> the 2025 roadmap for Avowed, which consists of three big updates for the rest of the year, the first of which is out now with update 1.4.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Avowed will include a new game-plus mode, a photo mode, NPCs will have new abilities and behaviors, players will get new character presets, Godlike features, weapons, and the ability to change your appearance in the world. But that's all to come in the Summer and Fall 2025 updates.</p>
<p>As for today's Spring 2025 update with patch 1.4, Obsidian has added an arachnophobia mode, mouse and keyboard support for Xbox console players, fog of war improvements, more gold and crafting materials, and a slew of bug fixes and other tweaks that Obsidian gets into in the<a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/"> full patch notes</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">blog post</a> about the roadmap and today's update on its website, Obsidian also called out that it is working to add localized language versions of Avowed for Korean, Japanese, and French-speaking players. The studio doesn't say when those versions will be available, but is "<em>committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> enjoyed Avowed when it arrived earlier this year, saying in his review that Avowed "<em>marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds</em>."</p>
<p>And soon we'll know just how significant it is with direct comparison to Obsidian's next game, The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to release on June 8, 2025.</p>
