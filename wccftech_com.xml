			<p>The Farm 51 has been working on Chernobylite 2 for over three years, and today, one of the most significant milestones for the team has been achieved. The Kickstarter campaign for this game has reached more than 200% of the initial funding goal. The team exceeded its campaign target with six stretch goals, which has allowed the team to secure additional expansion of the project beyond the original plans that were set in place. This includes extra locations to explore for both single-player and co-op missions, as well as a customizable interface. The Farm 51 has created an infographic that goes into detail about their Kickstarter, as well as the team's dedication to creating this new game.</p>

<p>The developers have announced that the Kickstarter campaign will continue to be live thanks to the option of Late Pledges, where those who pledge can still support the team and get some of the rewards that are available.</p>

			<p>The cult classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is receiving a lot of attention in the modding community <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic-modders-show-rtx-remix-upgrade-co-op-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to wiltOS Technologies</a>, which is hard at work on three mods (plus a bonus one) to rejuvenate the 2006 game originally developed by Arkane and published by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dark-messiah-restoration-mod" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration mod</a>, which brings back some cut content with the help of Ubisoft. The modders were provided with access to assets from Elements, the Xbox 360 version of the game. Thanks to this, the bonus missions and alternate levels that were featured in that version of the game can now be played on PC. Players can also experience The Caves, a cut level, and use cut weapons such as the Sword of Misery or the Necromancer's Staff.</p>
<p>WiltOS Technologies even introduced quality-of-life features such as the Bonus Maps system, which allows level loading without console commands, and a redesigned new game menu with chapter and class selection taken from the Elements. With the Bonus Maps menu, the madders also added a Challenge mode that uses the map add system.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Then there's the online co-op mod, which has just launched as a public test build downloadable <a href="https://github.com/KingDavidW/DarkMessiah-Coop-Mod-Files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GitHub</a>. This is still an early build, though, as evidenced by the fact that three major features are missing: the new player models, the refined revive mechanics, and the cutscenes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's the Dark Messiah of Might and Magic graphics overhaul mod powered by NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod just got a new trailer, which you can find embedded below.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX Remix Project | Dark Messiah of Might and Magic | The City of Stonehelm" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN347m66sgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The team of asset makers for the RTX Remix mod has expanded from two to three, but these high-quality assets take a long time to complete. Because of that, wiltOS Technologies plans to first release a version with the original textures and the RTX Remix enhanced lighting and then slowly introduce the improved textures as they are ready.</p>
<p>The bonus mod mentioned earlier in the article is a proof-of-concept for random map generation based on certain rules. Called 'The Trials of Kha-Baleth', it's meant to be an unofficial continuation to the story that uses DungeonGen technology derived from Alien Swarm's TileGen technology. In addition, players have the option to simply start a randomized level or create their own campaign. You can follow the progress of this work <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-trials-of-kha-baleth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Are you excited that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is getting all this attention after nearly twenty years from its release?</p>
