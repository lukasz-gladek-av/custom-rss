			<p>Despite having yet to be officially revealed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5.7</a> may not be too far from release, judging from some recent discoveries.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/theredpix">TheRedPixel</a>, an Unreal Engine 5.7 branch is already available on GitHub, while the Main branch has been bumped to 5.8, suggesting the new version of the engine shouldn't be too far from release. While we don't know when the announcement and release will happen, there's a good chance a preview may be released later this month during Unreal Fest Stockholm, which will be held from September 22 to September 24, as TheRedPixel speculates. Likewise, there's no news regarding which new features and improvements the latest version of the engine will bring, but it is expected it will include improvements to hardware Lumen as well as Nanite Foliage.</p>

And they also bumped Main to 5.8. Remember that 5.6 was delayed, as the usual time of engine ver release is around April (1st) and November(2nd).  They may release a preview around the dates of Unreal Fest Stockholm… <a href="https://t.co/lx8RRHaHC4">pic.twitter.com/lx8RRHaHC4</a></p>— TheRedPixel (@theredpix) <a href="https://twitter.com/theredpix/status/1964125325224194052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>The current version of the engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, was launched in June, following the annual edition of State of Unreal. This version of the engine packs hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, revamped Tween Tools and redesigned Curve editor and more. The improvements made to the engine have also brought siginficant CPU and GPU improvements over version 5.4, as shown in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-significant-performance-improvements/">comparison video</a> putting a Paris Tech Demo running in UE 5.6 and UE 5.4 running side by side.</p>



<p>Hopefully, every improvement coming with Unreal Engine 5.7 will help reduce the stuttering issues prevalent in almost every game powered by the engine. One exception seems to be Silent Hill F, Konami's new entry in the survival horror series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/">as its Gamescom demo ran so well that it almost felt like it wasn't powered by UE5.</a></p>
