			<p>The Game Awards 2025 might've received <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999330579041730881">a 'D' grade from viewers who voted in the poll</a> that the show's host and creator, Geoff Keighley, puts up on X (formerly Twitter) every year, but that didn't get people to turn away from the show. Keighley and his Game Awards team have, as they do every year, reported the viewership numbers from this year's show. Just like last year, it's another record-breaking year.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 was the most-watched Game Awards ever, with 171 million livestreams of the entire show across the globe. Viewership was up 11% compared to last year, conversation about the show on X (formerly Twitter) was up 12% compared to last year, and there were 23,000 co-streams of the show across Twitch and YouTube, which is more than a 50% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p>And all of that doesn't even include the viewership numbers from Amazon Prime Video, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">as the show made its Prime Video debut this year</a> as one of the streamer's live events. </p>

<p>The show is undeniably the biggest event of the year within the video games industry, even if it's not the most impactful to the industry, and it has continuously grown exponentially for years now. It's a credit to Keighley and his team that they are able to improve on the show's viewership and reach every year, even if the content of the show itself fluctuates far more than anyone would like to see.</p>
