			<p>Neverness to Everness, the open-world gacha RPG in development by Hotta Studio, looks to deliver the anime GTA fantasy that no one knew they wanted, judging from some recent footage.</p>
<p>The new footage was shared as part of a new Containment Test Preview livestream that provided a new look at some of the game's features and mechanics, such as the urban open-world, characters, traversal, and more. As if the urban setting wasn't enough to label the game as a sort of anime GTA, the developer shared during the livestream footage of one of the main playable characters stealing a car and becoming wanted by the police. While the disconnect between the character design and committing crimes is enormous, it's undeniable that there's something charming in seeing an anime GTA experience. Hopefully, the game will be as fun to play as it looks in this early footage.</p>

<p>Neverness to Everness was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">announced</a> almost one year ago by Hotta Studio, a Perfect World subsidiary that released Tower of Fantasy, another gacha RPG, a couple of years back, which failed to make a significant splash in the genre dominated by HoYoverse's games like Genshin Impact. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game will feature cel-shaded graphics like most games featuring Japanese anime aesthetics and will support advanced PC features like NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing. More information on the game and any upcoming playtests can be found on its <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/concept0718/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-will-speed-onto-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-and-pc-in-fall-2025/">Project Motor Racing</a> developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have announced that the upcoming sim racing game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 25, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer showcases Project Motor Racing's career mode and the intricacies involved in how Straight4 Studios is simulating the career of a professional racer, where winning isn't always the most important thing. It's being able to afford the next race, win or lose.</p>
<p>"<em>We wanted to capture the harsh reality of pro motorsport</em>," said the game design director at Straight4 Studios, Austin Ogonoski, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Budgets, repairs, sponsors. Failed overtakes that don't just wreck your car but your whole season. Your career in Project Motor Racing is motorsport with consequences</em>."</p>
<p>The career mode will have you negotiating sponsorships, what you can afford to build out your car, and the choice between giving it your all in each race versus making sure you'll have a car to race with for the next one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date and the introduction of the career mode, publisher GIANTS Software also confirms that the game will launch with full modding support on day one.</p>
<p>The game is being built with the GIANTS Engine, and as the company's head of publisher, Boris Stefan put it in a press release, "<em>Project Motor Racing taps into the same powerhouse modding ecosystem as Farming Simulator. Racing modders will be able to tweak, tune, and transform their experience however they like.</em>"</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now available for Project Motor Racing on all platforms.</p>
