			<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 are doing a lot to fight cheating on PC, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requirement of Secure Boot</a> and Trusted Platform Module (TDM) 2.0. However, nowadays, cheating is an issue even on consoles. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Push Square</a>, Ripple Effect Technical Director Christian Buhl said they have partnered with Sony and Microsoft to better detect things like Cronus Zen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</em></p>



<p><em>So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here.</em> <em>And we want to preserve as much of the fair play and competitive integrity that we can, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure that you're having a fair competitive space to play Battlefield 6 in.</em></p>



<p>Cronus Zen not only fools games into believing a player is using the gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard they've actually connected to their consoles, but it also provides access to game scripts and a script compiler, opening the door to many different types of cheats. Needless to say, this could ruin the experience of many players once Battlefield 6 launches on October 10. Here's hoping the collaboration with Sony and Microsoft turns out to be helpful against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ripple Effect also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that console players will be able to turn off cross-play with PC, which remains the platform most likely to be affected by cheats.</p>
