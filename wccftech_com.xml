			<p><strong>Riot</strong> has announced that the <strong>2XKO </strong>team, which just celebrated launching the new <strong>League of Legends-</strong>based 2v2 tag fighter out of early access less than a month ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">January 20</a>,</strong> will lose <strong>80 members of its development team</strong> in a round of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoffs</a></strong>. The news was confirmed in a blog post from the game's executive producer, <strong><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">Tom Cannon</a></strong>, who cited that despite the game doing well with its "<em>core audience</em>," the "<em>overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>While the statement itself doesn't cite the exact number of developers who were laid off, a report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> adds that a Riot spokesperson confirmed that approximately 80, which rounds out to approximately half of the game's initial development team, are losing their jobs.</p>



<p>"<em>As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO</em>," Cannon explained. "<em>The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</em>"</p>



<p>Cannon added that the plans for the upcoming 2026 Competitive Series remain "<em>unchanged</em>," and that this decision is a "<em>reshaping</em>" of the team, "<em>to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward</em>." Cannon also noted that the decision is not a reflection on any individual member of the development team, and that Riot is doing what it can to help the impacted developers.</p>



<p>Cannon concluded, "<em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</em> <em>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community</em>."</p>



<p>At the top of the year, 2XKO was one of Wccftech's<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/"> Most Anticipated Fighting Games of 2026</a>. Before that, even in its early access state, it made our list for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Best Fighting Games of 2025</a>. It's a bold fighting game with a strong aesthetic that gives players a fresh introduction to the League of Legends franchise and its characters that have lasted for so long.</p>



<p>This is the latest layoff in the video game industry, after January was already riddled with layoffs from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong>, from UK developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB)</strong>, was arguably the worst game to come out in 2025. It was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of last year by Metacritic's standards, </a>reaching only a <strong>37</strong>, and was called out ruthlessly for the broken state it arrived in on launch. While the studio has made <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">several strides to update and fix the game </a>and save the studio, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> digs into whether that's even possible. According to some former members of BaRB staff, the answer is a resounding no.</p>



<p>To say MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy have had a difficult time in the last year would be an understatement. Before the game even came out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">negative previews</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">sudden departure of two high-level executives</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies leaking into the wild early</a> spelled a disastrous launch for MindsEye. </p>



<p>BaRB did its best to quell concerns at the time, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/"> while it was "<em>heartbroken</em>,"</a> it promised to update and fix the game, but the damage was done. Players <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">were getting refunds</a>, and the Reddit page was littered with screencaps and videos of the game's worst bugs. Less than a month after its release, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">confirmed it would be <strong>suffering mass layoffs</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As BaRB warned players it would release updates <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">"<em>less frequently</em>"</a> to try and pack in as much as it can per update, in the months following its launch, an open letter from <strong>93 BaRB developers called out the </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/"><strong>studio's leaders, Leslie Benzies and Mark Gerhard</strong></a><strong>,</strong> as the root of the studio's problems. A little more than a week after that open letter, a report from the BBC included more statements from BaRB employees and revealed new examples pointing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">Gerhard and Benzies as the root of the studio's problems</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Benzies and Gerhard blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>"</a> for the company's issues. A story that Gerhard recently doubled down on, as the studio claimed to have acquired evidence of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-claims-it-has-evidence-of-a-1-1m-coordinated-campaign-to-sabotage-its-reputation/"><strong>"<em>coordinated campaign</em>"</strong> </a>to smear the reputation of BaRB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Now, GI.Biz's new report is the latest example that shows, once again, the simplest answer is probably the truth. Instead of an alleged smear campaign that cost an unnamed American company upwards of <strong>$1.1 million</strong> to carry out, MindsEye and BaRB's troubles more likely stem from poor leadership that was seemingly unwilling to listen to the hundreds of talented developers they hired to make this game.</p>



<p>"<em>I'd hoped for more of an explanation about the layoffs and our company situation</em>," said one former BaRB staff member when recalling the events of what happened within BaRB shortly after MindsEye launched. "<em>But instead, <strong>we'd been told there were saboteurs inside and outside the company</strong> trying to take us down. <strong>Leslie didn't seem to take any blame for the game's launch</strong>. It was genuinely <strong>offensive</strong> that he didn't trust his own employees. The idea that we'd sabotage a game we'd spent countless hours working on was just rude to me.</em>"</p>



<p>One thing mentioned in the report is the idea that co-founder and co-chief executive officer Leslie Benzies would fixate on a certain feature or new idea that he demanded be given priority over everything else developers were doing. The staffers who spoke to the BBC for their report in October 2025 dubbed them "<em>Leslies</em>," though that specific shorthand is not mentioned here.</p>



<p>"<em>If management had concentrated on tightening everything up at that point, <strong>then it could have worked</strong></em>," added <strong>Ben Newbon</strong>, former lead data analyst for BaRB. "<em>But instead, they kept on trying to throw extra stuff on it</em>. <em>Leslie's eye would be caught by something in particular and then insist this extra feature be added in, even like a month before launch. There wasn't enough time to test those things and to get all the pieces in place to actually <strong>make it work without it breaking</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another staff member added, referring to Benzies, "<em>They crushed their own talent under the yoke of appeasing a single person at the very top</em>." One former member even believed the game could have been a hit, if not for management. "<em>He [Benzies] may have had a winning formula if he'd have listened to the advice from the literal hundreds of fantastic, insanely talented, and hard-working industry professionals they spent so much time and money hiring</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We had so many fundamental changes to the game that it <strong>would've been impossible to make a good game in the time we had</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Speaking of Benzies, the report also adds that he has taken a <strong>temporary leave</strong> from the studio, with a statement from Gerhard saying he is on "<em>a well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward</em>," Gerhard continued. It's unclear if this leave will become permanent at this stage, though if some of the staff who spoke to GI.Biz for this report are correct, there won't be a BaRB to come back to.</p>



<p>"<em>Even if they had the best leadership in the world, there's no way to bring this back</em>," said Newbon. "<em>Even if they fix all of the bugs and technical issues, <strong>it's still an extremely boring game</strong>. Leadership do not listen. Plus, they've culled over half the studio. They don't know how to run a business. </em><strong><em>They don't know how to run a game studio</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>Another former staff member added, "<em>I don't think BaRB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BaRB, and it's not heralded by saboteurs, </em><strong><em>but by Mark and Leslie themselves</em>.</strong>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A couple of months ago, independent developer <strong>Chaos Manufacturing</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sol-shogunate-samurai-space-opera-action-rpg-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its debut game</a>, a sci-fi action roleplaying game titled <strong>SOL Shogunate</strong>. The game is quite different from your average science fiction setting: the developers describe it as a "<strong>samurai space opera</strong>". Essentially, the developers have imagined an alternate future in which humanity has colonized the Solar System, but <strong>society has somehow retained feudal Japanese culture</strong>. The game takes place primarily on the Moon, where the way of the sword is law under the rule of a powerful Shogunate.</p>



<p>The Moon features artificial gravity-creating cities, <strong>each designed as an homage to a revered era of Japanese history</strong>. These gleaming metropolises showcase towering space elevators, bullet trains, and opulent districts where the shogunate elite enjoy Earthlike comforts, including simulated night cycles. However, beneath the glittering surface lies a darker reality: <strong>countless workers quietly live and die in service to the Shogunate</strong>. Players control <strong>Yuzuki</strong>, the sole surviving heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. After her family's destruction, she becomes an outlaw ronin and embarks on a blood-soaked path of vengeance through the lunar cities.</p>



<p>The developer, Chaos Manufacturing, places great importance on music for this project. The studio already announced collaborations with various artists, including Japanese rock band <strong>AliA</strong>. Following the unveiling, I reached out through PR and set up an interview with the founders, <strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong> (Game Director) and <strong>Guy Constantini</strong> (CEO), both of whom have extensive experience developing triple-A games. </p>



<p>It was a very intriguing conversation that made me even more interested in SOL Shogunate than I already was. As a reminder, <strong>the game is in early development</strong> for PC (you can already wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles. It may take a few years before we can play it, especially since the team is very small.</p>

<h2 id="aaa-indie-origins">From AAA to Indie - The Origins of Chaos Manufacturing</h2>



<p><strong>Welcome! Tell us about your respective backgrounds.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leszek Szczepański:</strong> Sure. Hi, my name is Leszek Szczepański. I'm the Game Director at Chaos Manufacturing, which effectively means I drive the development effort. I gather a lot of talented and creative people and direct them in a way that helps us create this game. I've been in games for approaching 18 years. I'm Polish and worked in games in Poland for five years initially. Back in the day, I worked on mobile versions of <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>, among others. After five years, I wanted to do bigger games. I looked around Europe and found Guerrilla Games in the Netherlands, part of PlayStation.</p>



<p>There, <strong>I worked on <em>Killzone Shadow Fall</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> almost from the beginning, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></strong>. Over this time, I’ve been an engineer, a designer, managed a few gaming projects, and used to be a professional Dungeon Master. After all this, I realized it was time to build something of my own. Around that time, I got introduced to Guy. I realized he is the yin to my yang; we complement each other quite well, so we decided to get Chaos going together about two years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I’m Guy Constantini. I am the General Manager and CEO (or "wrangler of cats") at Chaos Manufacturing. I make sure that if there's something that needs to be done, there is either a person to do it, or I have to do it myself. We met a couple of years ago and have been working on this ever since. I grew up in Milano and Monza, where my dad brought home an Atari 2600, which tells you how old I am. From there, I decided I needed to make my way to the States. I studied in New Jersey at Rutgers, but none of my initial jobs on the East Coast were in games. I realized I needed to get into the industry, so I moved to the West Coast and found this company called Riot Games. At the time, they were working on a little indie game called <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<p>I worked on that for a bit, then went to Kabam in San Francisco to work on <em>Marvel Contest of Champions</em>. I realized I didn't want to work in mobile games, so I came back down to Los Angeles to work for CD Projekt Red. <strong>I split my time between LA and Warsaw during the tail end of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and the beginning of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong>. From there, I went to Skydance Interactive and worked on <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em> (Chapter 1 and 2) and <em>Behemoth</em>.</p>



<p>Eventually, I realized I had brought games to every platform currently in use. I decided to see if I could start my own company and make the games I finally wanted to make for the rest of my life. I knew I needed a competent Game Director because, while I know how to build projects, I don't know how to build a game from scratch myself. </p>



<p><strong>You both have impressive credits. Guerrilla Games and CD Projekt Red are basically as AAA as it gets. Tell us more about Chaos Manufacturing. What kind of company did you envision, and how big is it? Is it remote or hybrid?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We learned a lot of lessons working on big and small projects. We always wanted to build something tight that punched above its weight. The idea was to find the right people because we think that if we do this correctly, those people will have wonderful lives.</p>



<p>Obviously, you have to have a concept for a company and cool games, but really, it's about the philosophy that drives us. We embrace the "chaos" of game development. I put it in the title so that if things ever feel frayed at the edges, we can point to the name!</p>



<p>We wanted to find autodidacts with a passion for knowledge. People who pursue mastery on their own. In a startup, you have to do things you're great at and things that simply need to be done. In exchange for this massive autonomy, we wanted to give people something worthwhile. Everyone in the company has at least a piece of what we're building. Eventually, once equity stops mattering, it'll be profit sharing. The idea is that people making the game should partake in the results of their success.</p>



<p><strong>We also wanted to give people ultimate flexibility. We don't want you to move across the ocean just to see if something works out. That's why right now we're pretty much remote</strong>. The intent isn't to be remote for the sake of it, but to ask the people how they want to work together and have the company adjust to them. A company is a group of people, so the people should inform how the company functions. We think that is a more sustainable way of building a business.</p>



<p><strong>We've been up to five people full-time, and that number fluctuates depending on where we are in our go-to-market path. We have a constellation of fractional people helping us out.</strong> One of my pet peeves is when people say, "This was a one-man job." It never really is. We will always credit the people involved. At the very core, I just want to treat people the way I want to be treated.</p>



<p><strong>Are you self-funded? I know it's a tough environment for the industry right now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I joke that I picked the best and worst time to do this. I have learned a lot about how tough fundraising is. Everything we've raised so far has been from angels—small checks cobbled together to build things. We definitely have some financing partners that have come to the table recently.</p>



<p>Our approach has always been: find the right partners, raise the money we can, and build responsibly with that money. Our model allows us to only grow as much as we need. <strong>We could always use more funding, but I’d rather not start than take money from the wrong people</strong> and end up in a situation where we grow too much, things go wrong, and people are out of a job.</p>



<p><strong>Is the goal to self-publish, or would you consider a publisher?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I am very open to financing partners of various sorts. I know how to build a publisher; I've done so before efficiently. However, some publishers have capabilities I don't have. For the right partner, we are flexible, provided we retain creative control and they bring something to the table we lack. <strong>We don't have a publisher involved yet, but we are open to it depending on the partner</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-samurai-space-opera">SOL Shogunate: Creating a "Samurai Space Opera"</h2>



<p><strong>Moving on to the game, SOL Shogunate. The setting is quite interesting; space opera isn't usually connected to samurai. How did that idea come about?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The act of creation is inherently selfish. To create anything of value, you need to really believe in it, and to do that, you use the things you are passionate about. We looked at what we love: hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, near-future sci-fi, samurai fiction, Japanese music, and anime. We took these fascinations and put them together into a coherent whole. SOL Shogunate is what we call a "Samurai Space Opera," a mix of all these things we are passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We wanted to find a space that hadn't been explored a ton. <strong>We’ve seen samurai fiction and sci-fi alt-futures, but we wanted to architect a surreal future that feels fresh. We wanted to surprise people with the mix we put together.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, the idea came from a piece of concept art by a wonderful artist who works with us, <strong>Aaron Nakahara</strong> (Kobaltplasma). He had this stylized image of a warrior who looked like a traditional samurai but had a burning light in the middle of his face. It reminded me of times we've seen samurai or ninja aesthetics in the future where it felt like just a coat of paint. I wanted to build something with an intentional aesthetic that came from a specific reason.</p>



<p><strong>The protagonist, Yuzuki, is an outlaw out for revenge, which is a bit common nowadays. How do you plan to make her stand out compared to the average Ronin?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Honestly, the revenge part is just the first domino to fall. The story is not typical samurai fiction; it’s about unraveling mysteries regarding creation and destruction. The tragedy sets you on a path, but that path takes you to unexpected places.</p>



<p>Secondly, there is a reason we put Yuzuki in the future on the moon. She is a future samurai. The way she moves, fights, and looks is different. She has a sword, but also a thruster pack and grappling hooks, fighting in low gravity. We asked ourselves: "What is a future space samurai on the moon?"</p>



<p>Also, the idea of genetic modification is deeply ingrained in the story and setting. <strong>Yuzuki has unique genetic modifications. Her armor is inspired by samurai armor, but it's also part of her genetic augments that allow her to survive in the vacuum of space.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> If you read <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, you know that to be a samurai means to become the ultimate warrior. We wanted to ask: what does someone who idolizes this ethos do when they have access to technology 200 years in the future, like personal jetpacks and bioceramic skin? What does that do to the ultimate warrior? We carved out a character that behaves differently from a warrior in feudal Japan or a standard sci-fi soldier.</p>



<p><b>Does she have ranged capabilities, or is she meant to be a melee-only character?</b></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The vast majority of her skills are based around melee weapons. <strong>She has grappling hooks to close the distance quickly</strong>. Through our upgrade system, she will unlock certain additional abilities, some of which might work at a distance, but ultimately these are there to enhance her fighting capabilities.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/211025_SolShogunate_ChaosManufacturing_Screenshot1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="gameplay-deep-dive">Gameplay Deep Dive - Music-Synced Battles and Genetic Upgrades</h2>



<p><strong>You mentioned unlocking skills. How does progression work in SOL Shogunate? Are there levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: We have two elements of character progression. The simpler one is finding different weapons and unlocking armors as the story progresses. The major element is our genetic upgrade system.</p>



<p><strong>We don't have a typical skill tree. Throughout the game, Yuzuki collects "Gene Slices" by defeating enemies or finding them in the environment.</strong> These connect to specific abilities or passive buffs. You equip these on a "Gene Board." Depending on how they are placed, they might interact with each other to unlock new abilities. You can also mutate genes together to create new combinations.</p>



<p>Realistically, every playthrough will be a little different regarding the skills and upgrades the player discovers. This feeds not only into combat but also into how she interacts with the world and the story.</p>



<p><strong>Can you respec these mutations, or are they permanent?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: You can reorganize your Gene Board at almost any point. However, once you mutate two genes to create a new one, the original two are consumed and gone.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>The intent is that you have to make decisions that can't be reversed</strong>, but there is a lot of flexibility in how you rearrange your build.</p>



<p><strong>One of the main official features is the multi-phase boss fights. You mentioned they are cinematic but dynamic. How do you plan to make them exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Calling them just "boss fights" isn't precise; we think of them as epic set pieces. <strong>Some will be boss fights, but others might be elaborate encounters with multiple enemies.</strong> We treat these set pieces as puzzles; you need to figure out what tools you have and how to utilize them, similar to <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p>



<p>Since SOL Shogunate is a samurai space opera, music is fundamental. We are working with a number of Japanese rock bands to create specific music pieces for these encounters. A good song tells a story, and so does a good encounter. We want to synchronize them perfectly.</p>



<p>The music flows and evolves: intro, chorus, bridge. We ensure the encounter evolves exactly on the beat of the song. If a boss changes phases, it happens on the beat, and the music adds layers, like a choir or orchestra. I call it an "overwhelming cocktail of emotions," where the player is overwhelmed by what they see, hear, and interact with.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be difficulty levels so that players can customize the level of challenge in SOL Shogunate?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes. Our aim is to make a game that requires effort to finish, without overwhelming everyone. If you are a casual player, there will be an easy difficulty. If you want a proper challenge, there will be a hard mode.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>For those looking for a challenge, the harder difficulties will require you to really dig for ways to overcome enemies</strong>. Our systems are interlocking; once you understand them, you become stronger. I personally like games that "beat my face into the ground," so there will be something for that type of gamer.</p>



<p><strong>Regarding the narrative and space opera aspects, how are you tackling exposition and world-building?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: SOL Shogunate is a Japanese-style Action RPG, so we focus on strong characters and a vibrant world. We want to create the Moon (and maybe something larger later) full of life, factions, and people with their own stories. We want an intricate story with mysteries, misdirection, and puzzles, set in a rich world with conflicting truths.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> The premise, a samurai caste in charge of humanity, is just the tip of the iceberg. You have large rotating city biomes inside the moon with simulated gravity connected by train lines. Outside is the dangerous lunar surface with remnants of a solar system-wide war.</p>



<p><strong>The story is about two characters. Yuzuki is the primary playable character, but it’s a story of two people from different walks of life whose worldviews are shattered and pieced back together</strong>. Yuzuki’s skin is reminiscent of <em>Kintsugi</em> (repairing pottery with gold) because she is the "shattered heir" rebuilding herself. We believe in storytelling through gameplay, including artifacts, radio comms, and cinematics.</p>



<p><strong>Just to clarify, only Yuzuki is playable?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, correct.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the scope? 15-20 hours, maybe?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We aren't ready to talk about specific length or pricing yet, but philosophically, <strong>we think the world wants quality over quantity</strong>. Everyone has a stack of unplayed games that are hundreds of hours long. We want strong gameplay quality and visual fidelity that respects your time and wallet. It will definitely be beyond 10 hours, priced generously.</p>

<h2 id="tech-philosophy-stance-AI">Tech &amp; Philosophy - Unreal Engine 5 and the Studio's Stance on AI</h2>



<p><strong>Are you talking about a launch on next-gen consoles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We want people on all kinds of devices to play. We are definitely coming to PC and Console. We’re developing controller-first, but PC will have a strong keyboard configuration. We want to build something tight, like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and if players want more, we’ll make <em>Arkham City</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, it’s not a secret that we are working on Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed the Steam page previously had minimum requirements like a GTX 970, which seemed way too low.</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Apologies, that was an error. We removed them. We aren't at a stage to talk about target requirements yet.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> That was my fault! But generally, we want to make games that run on a wide range of hardware, though obviously, they will look incredible on the latest gear.</p>



<p><strong>A bonus question about the recent controversy with Larian regarding AI usage. What is your stance on AI?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>Our game art is handcrafted</strong>. Our principal concept artist went couch surfing all over Japan to take pictures to build worlds inspired by real life. I like to let artists inform what tools they use, not tell them to use something just to save a buck. So far, our artists say making things by hand works best.</p>



<p>That said, anyone who says they know what they’ll be doing in two years is lying. Technology changes. If a new tool is great and artists love it, no problem. But right now, we prioritize the handcrafted approach.</p>



<p><strong>Nice. Well, thank you both for the lovely chat.</strong></p>
