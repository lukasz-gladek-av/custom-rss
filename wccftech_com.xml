			<p>Morsels, a top-down creature-collecting rougelike shooter from indie developer Furcula and publisher Annapurna Interactive, has a November 18, 2025 release date, the two companies announced today.</p>



<p>The unique and self-described "<em>oddball</em>" game was first showcased at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August 2024 and will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch when it arrives this coming November.</p>



<p><a href="https://furcula.ca/">Furcula</a> is a new Toronto-based indie developer, with Morsels being the studio's debut title from a three-person team made up of artist Toby Dixon, musician Sam Webster, and designer and programmer Iggy Zuk.</p>



<p>You play as a little mouse, diving into the sewers for scraps, who happens upon a magical frog-looking creature called a fatberg that transforms you into a Morsel, and grants you the power to swap between other Morsels you find along your journey, switching from one to the next to try and meet your situation.</p>

<p>I played Morsels earlier this year as part of my <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest round-up for the June 2025 Next Fest</a>, and highlighted it as my favorite of the demos I played while the festival was on. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</em>"</p>



<p>Thankfully for me, it will indeed be arriving this year, and thankfully for you, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">demo is still available to play on Steam</a> if you want to check it out ahead of release.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers know that they have the ability to stream their games through Xbox Cloud Gaming, if they're ever inclined to stream whatever they want to play rather than play it natively on their preferred device. Currently, that option is only available to players who are paying for that top-tier subscription for Xbox Game Pass, but Microsoft's vice president of next generation, Jason Ronald, seems to have hinted that a "<em>more affordable</em>" plan for Xbox Cloud Gaming could be on the way.</p>



<p>During the official Xbox podcast, Ronald and Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox, discussed a variety of topics, including the Cloud Gaming service, and what could be on the horizon for Microsoft's investment in cloud gaming.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal is really simple. We want to bring more games to more people. Cloud gaming is great at that</em>," said Beaumont. He continued to say that achieving that goal would include expanding the service to more countries around the world, and to as many devices as Xbox can.</p>



<p>Ronald, for his part, added "<em>One of the things we see is there's a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that's the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go. And so for us, I think it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable and to make it more accessible to more players, whether that's going into new regions or new ways to actually access the cloud."</em></p>

<p>Ronald stops there, and doesn't go further to say that Microsoft and Xbox are prepared to launch a new tier for Game Pass that's just focused on Cloud Gaming, but that's the obvious way you'd think Microsoft would make its cloud gaming service more affordable, by making a tier that is exclusively streaming-focused, and isn't tied to the rest of the features you get from Game Pass, like being able to download every title natively to your device.</p>



<p>We'll see if that's a path Microsoft ends up choosing. In the meantime, the company is preparing to debut its <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> device at Gamescom 2025.</p>
