			<p>Doug Jung, the writer for films like Star Trek: Beyond and The Cloverfield Paradox, and TV series like Mindhunter has been selected to be the showrunner for Amazon MGM Studios upcoming TV adaptation of Mass Effect.</p>
<p>The news comes from a new <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/mass-effect-doug-jung-tv-series-showrunner-1236423704/">Deadline</a> report, confirming that Jung will lead the show's development and begin working in collaboration with Dan Casey, who has been writing for the show for the past year.</p>
<p>The very first time we heard about a Mass Effect TV series in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">works was in 2021</a>, and at the time, Amazon was only just securing a deal with EA and BioWare to make the series. Then, last November, we learned that<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/"> Fast and Furious 9 writer Dan Casey</a> had joined the project as a writer and executive producer, though the show was still missing its showrunner.</p>
<p>Now that Jung has filled that position, hopefully the series can actually start to make some serious progress and be out sometime in the near future. It's still unclear what direction the adaptation will take, if it'll be set in some part of the Mass Effect universe we don't get to see in the games, or if it'll follow along Shepard's journey, and be something more akin to HBO's The Last of Us, which sticks very close to the story in the games, save for a few changes in how the story is dolled out.</p>
<p>Who knows how this series will pan out, but one thing that Mass Effect fans can take solace in is the fact that it's a TV series adaptation, instead of a film adaptation. Part of what players love about Mass Effect's story is the small character moments that happen in between the main plot's bigger and bombastic events.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be impossible to convey the feeling of Mass Effect in a film, but it would be far more difficult simply due to time constraints. A premier TV show, however, can practically take as much time as it wants, if the series is a success. There's easily a version of a Mass Effect TV show that takes the characters from the games we all love, and takes them on endless adventures we would have never seen in the games. That's the hope, at least.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuVeWIoqPPk">supported</a> keyboard and mouse controls, but it wasn't always a plug-and-play situation, and only a few games specifically supported the controls. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, however, not only supports keyboard and mouse controls but seems to support them natively, meaning that for most games, it is, in fact, a plug-and-play situation if you want to use a keyboard and mouse for a game on your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>YouTuber Blunty noticed that while playing Cyberpunk 2077 on their Nintendo Switch 2, even with mouse controls turned off in the game's settings, the console still responded to their wireless mouse, which was plugged into the Nintendo Switch 2's dock.</p>
<p>Of course, Blunty didn't stop there and took the next obvious step of plugging in a keyboard. Sure enough, it worked without a hitch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wait... Cyberpunk on Switch 2 JUST WORKS with Mouse &amp; Keyboard!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCNUKwCQ35o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with Cyberpunk 2077, we also know that Koei Tecmo's upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports mouse controls, because the developers showed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support">off during a live stream last month</a>. But that was just one game, and it wasn't clear at the time if this was a feature that Koei Tecmo had to add, or if mouse controls were natively supported by the Switch 2.</p>
<p>But seeing them just work on Cyberpunk 2077 without any prior setup and by just plugging in USB dongles for a mouse and keyboard, it seems to suggest that you can plug in a mouse and keyboard for almost any game and have it work seamlessly.</p>
<p>That'll be figured out as more people get their hands on a Switch 2 and test the keyboard and mouse functionality for each game, but it seems like the work Nintendo put in to make the new JoyCons work like a mouse comes with the added benefit of being able to plug in a USB keyboard and mouse for pretty much anything, and have it work without issue.</p>
