            <title><![CDATA[‘It’s Absolutely Crazy’ – Veteran Developer Can’t Wrap His Head Around Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s Quality and Its Small Team]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/</link>
            <guid>1410607</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Much has been said about the incredible level of quality that <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> put into <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a budget of <strong>less than $10 million</strong></a> and a core team of <strong>around thirty employees</strong>. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/witchfires-creative-director-on-the-benefits-of-small-teams-and-the-mystery-of-how-clair-obscur-turned-out-so-brilliantly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, another veteran developer has expressed his absolute disbelief at what the Montpellier-based studio was able to pull off with this game. He's <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>, the founder and CEO of independent Polish developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong>, known for <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong> and the upcoming roguelite first-person shooter <strong>Witchfire</strong> (on which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed him in September 2023</a>), due to be released out of early access at some point this year.</p>



<p>Chmielarz, who previously worked on games like <strong>Painkiller</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Judgment</strong>, and <strong>Bulletstorm</strong> while at <strong>People Can Fly</strong> (which he originally founded in 2002), has always been outspoken. Just last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his viewpoint on why PC gamers prefer <strong>Steam</strong> over the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In the new interview, he calls Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 '<strong>the biggest mystery in gaming right now</strong>':</p>



<p><em>Last week, I learned that the guys behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hired a lot of newbies, people who didn't make a game before. And now my world view is ruined, and I don't know what to do. Here we have a game that looks AAA to me, it's just phenomenal in every aspect. There's a deep story, deep method of work, good gameplay, great visuals and sound. It's a very coherent product. And then you hear that the core team was 30 people, half of which were first timers. And I'm like, "I don't know what to believe anymore."</em></p>



<p><em>The head of the studio had a two-hour conference in France where they were discussing the process of making this game. I haven't watched this yet, but I downloaded it, and I have transcribed the audio and translated it to English. And this video is waiting for me, because I need to know the secret, because it's absolutely crazy.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, we didn't make Witchfire with 26 people, because we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing – when you roll the credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, it's 10 or 15 minutes long. But still, that doesn't change the fact that the core team responsible for the vast majority of the game and the ideas and execution is around 30 people, half of whom are new. So it's the biggest mystery in gaming right now.</em></p>



<p>That said, he does point out a couple of things with the eye of a designer. For one thing, <strong>the game's enemies lack faces by design</strong>, which is one way to cut down on animation work. Furthermore, the high-quality scenes are more like theatrical plays in that <strong>the characters never interact with the environment</strong>, which, in his experience, is one of the most challenging aspects when making cutscenes.</p>



<p>Quite obviously, there are other such 'tricks' that Sandfall has employed, but the final outcome cannot be argued with. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an astounding amount of prizes during the award season</a>, including a few days ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-goty-2026-new-york-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>New York Game Awards</strong></a>, and there's likely more awards to come.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Reveals Mild Marathon PC System Requirements]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1410535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As is customary for any game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms a release date and opens up pre-orders</a>, <strong>Bungie</strong> revealed the official <strong>Marathon</strong> PC system requirements by updating the store page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>.</p>



<p>The good news is that any PC released in the past six to nine years should be able to run the game. The minimum graphics card requirement is either <strong>NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti</strong> (released in <strong>October 2016</strong>) or <strong>AMD's Radeon RX 5500 XT</strong> (launched in <strong>December 2019</strong>). Intel's option, the <strong>ARC A580</strong>, is much more recent, having been released in <strong>October 2023</strong>, but that's only because Intel entered the GPU market much later.</p>



<p>Overall, it is quite obvious that Bungie aims for Marathon to be playable on a vast number of computers, making the extraction shooter accessible to as many users as possible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Marathon</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4 GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8 GB, with ReBAR on)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8 GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16 GB, with ReBAR on)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Then again, this was always their philosophy, even with 2017's <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. For comparison, we've also included the PC system requirements of Bungie's previous game release. Marathon runs on an evolved version of the proprietary Destiny 2 '<strong>Tiger</strong>' engine, after all.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Destiny 2</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3 3250 3.5 GHz or Intel Pentium G4560 3.5 GHz / AMD FX-4350 4.2 GHz</td><td>Intel Core i5 2400 3.4 GHz or i5 7400 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen R5 1600X 3.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>6 GB RAM</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB / AMD R9 390 8GB Memory 8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>105 GB available space</td><td>105 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Anyway, the most interesting aspect of the Marathon PC system requirements is that they really open the door to a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> port. On paper, Nintendo's hybrid console should definitely have enough power to run the game, especially since it supports NVIDIA DLSS, whereas the GTX 1050 Ti does not. </p>



<p>Bungie Game Director <strong>Joe Ziegler</strong> did comment on this very topic <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/39409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Japanese website Famitsu</a>. This was shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in April 2025. Ziegler replied:</p>



<p><em>At the moment, we don't have any plans to add any other compatible hardware, but we will consider doing so in the future.</em></p>
