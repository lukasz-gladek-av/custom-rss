			<p>For a very long time, it was rumored that <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong> was working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/"><strong><em>Bloodborne</em> remaster for modern hardware</strong></a>, but dreams of seeing Yharnam in all of its haunting glory on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> were crushed by the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/"><strong>unfortunate closure</strong></a> last week. </p>



<p>Still, PC players can enjoy the classic <strong>FromSoftware</strong> action role-playing game with a slew of improvements on <strong>PC</strong>, thanks to the <strong>ShadPS4</strong> emulator and the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> by <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>, which was updated this week to a new version featuring some major overhauls.</p>



<p>The modding project's <strong>0.99.2 version</strong> biggest changes involve modified classic <strong>gparams</strong>, bringing the art direction much closer to that of the base game and making the project feel even more like an official remaster. In addition, this new version includes <strong>more upscaled textures</strong>, new <strong>shininess maps</strong>, and the removal of some <strong>baked lighting</strong> to enhance one of the best features of the project: <strong>fully dynamic lighting</strong> for the world.</p>



<p>The latest version of the <strong><em>Bloodborne Remaster Project</em></strong> can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nexus Mods</strong>.</a></p>

<p>Although these improvements make playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on <strong>PC</strong> via the <strong>ShadPS4</strong> emulator a better experience than on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, the emulated game sadly lacks support for the game's online features. However, soon enough, the game may support <strong>co-op</strong>, searching <strong>Chalice Dungeons</strong>, and <strong>asynchronous multiplayer</strong> features, thanks to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>future updates to the ShadPS4 emulator </strong></a>currently undergoing testing.</p>
