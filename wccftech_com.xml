			<p>Studio Atelico is a brand new gaming startup that has been founded by veterans of Uber, Meta, and Creative Assembly. Today they announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/">new AI Engine</a> that will enable game developers to create game experiences that are powered by GenAI that run on-device without having to pay extortionate prices for cloud solutions. With Atelico AI Engine, the costs of production are significantly reduced for developers, and it provides them with an experience that gives them full control and power.</p>
<p>CEO, Piero Molino made a statement today regarding their new AI engine, saying: "The revolution is upon us. GenAI is enabling new interactive experiences that have never been possible before. However, the current, large-model approach that Cloud AI providers are taking is fundamentally flawed for video games. Game developers currently implementing GenAI in their games are struggling due to the high costs and the lack of fine-grained control needed in video game development."</p>

<p>Of course, Generative AI in gaming is a heavy point of contention for both the consumer and the creator. There are people who feel that it should be left safely in the hands of humans to develop, while others feel that there are creative minds out there who should be able to use tools to make the development process easier without having to put the effort in.</p>
<p>Already there are many games on the market using AI, with a fair few of them not disclosing the fact that they are using AI in their titles. An<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ex-Steam Labs developer</a> has claimed that there are over 1000 Steam games that are using generative AI. This includes titles such as The Finals, Tribes 3, and Atman: Rebel Flame.</p>
<p>While most known studios won't be using AI for their games, more and more studios and developers are coming out of the woodwork with AI games. With the release of the Atelico AI Engine, there will now be even more potential for AI titles.</p>
<p>The Atelico AI Engine can be embedded into game engines, where the user will have full control and flexibility with the modular design of the tool. To showcase the tool, Studio Atelico has released a tech demo which is inspired by the Stanford paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." You can see the tech demo above, where you can see the model in action.</p>
<p>"Atelico AI Engine is the perfect tool for developers to invent entirely new game genres. We foresee a Cambrian explosion of creativity, where our AI tools empower designers to build more immersive experiences and truly widen the horizon of what's possible. The only limitation is the developer's imagination," says <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/cloud-ai-for-video-games-is-dead-on-arrival?dm_i=2AEH,21IEL,AMZC5B,7EFIS,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ennio De Nucci, Co-Founder and Design</a> Director of Studio Atelico.</p>
