			<p>Besides the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-legend-of-zelda-live-action-link-and-zelda-casting/">Legend of Zelda movie premiering in 2027</a>, we know that Nintendo is working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">follow-up</a> to its Super Mario Bros. film in 2023. Now, a day before what has been confirmed to be the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-confirms-this-weeks-general-direct-is-its-longest-ever/">longest general Nintendo Direct ever</a>, a new leak might've just revealed the title of the next film to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">Reddit</a>, NBC Universal has registered domains as of yesterday, September 10, 2025, which point to Super Mario Galaxy being the title. Both of the domains registered, when entered into your browser, <a href="http://supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com/">redirect to Universal's official website</a>. </p>



<p>That said, this does not necessarily mean the title is locked in, but the timing of the registrations do add some weight to Super Mario Galaxy potentially being the title for the coming Super Mario Bros. sequel. There's also the issue of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">a press release from this past May from NBC Universal</a> that seemed to let the title slip, though in that case, the supposed title was "<em>Super Mario World</em>."</p>



<p>In a way, when looking at the post-credits scene from the first Super Mario Bros. movie, which teased the arrival of Yoshi, Super Mario World does seem to make more sense. Though it's not like Yoshi is absent from the Galaxy games, meaning the door is still open for it to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>With the original Super Mario Bros. game about to celebrate its 40th anniversary this coming Saturday, September 13, 2025, and the next Super Mario Bros. film currently set to arrive on April 3, 2026, the timing does line up that we'd hear about the film's title <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct</a>, and potentially even some news around what the film will entail, possibly even a teaser trailer.</p>



<p>Regardless, we will hopefully know which leak is correct by tomorrow. If it's Super Mario World, then these domains are potentially for something else entirely. If it's Super Mario Galaxy, then who knows what NBC Universal was referring to when the phrase was included and then removed from a press release in May. We'll see what answers tomorrow does, or doesn't, bring.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows' latest title update, numbered <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">update 1.1.1</a>, has officially gone live today, with Ubisoft adding a slew of changes ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-plus-dlc-claws-of-awaji-release-date/">Claws of Awaji</a> expansion's launch on September 16, a new story quest for players to delve into, and new Ezio Auditore da Firenze-themed cosmetics for players to acquire through a new Animus HUB project.</p>



<p>The new quest being added sees you follow Junjiro in his quest to learn more about the Bo staff and find a legendary Bo master. You get your own Bo staff at the end of the quest, while this quest is free for all players, that wasn't always the case, as Ubisoft reveals it was initially designed as part of the Claws of Awaji expansion. Somewhere along the way, though, Ubisoft decided it shouldn't lock the weapon behind the Claws of Awaji paywall, or as Ubisoft puts it in its blog post "<em>we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone.</em>" While update 1.1.1 is live now, this quest and the Bo staff will arrive alongside the expansion on September 16.</p>



<p>What is live today is a level cap increase, improved scouts, new upgrades for your hideout, enhanced gear quality, the ability to advance the time of day, a slew of bug fixes, and a new Animus HUB project called Project Sanctuary, which grants players the Ezio-themed cosmetics for you and your cat.</p>

<p>When the Claws of Awaji expansion arrives, it'll add a new island region to explore, a new faction to face, the aforementioned Bo staff, new gear, abilities, and of course, a new storyline to follow and uncover. This expansion is the final step in Ubisoft's previously revealed summer roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>Once it's out, we should start to hear what Ubisoft has planned next for the game soon, since, at least for the foreseeable future, Ubisoft will continue to support what has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">best-selling games</a> of the year so far across the industry and not just for Ubisoft. </p>
