            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve is stuck in yet another content-related controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">regarding which games make it onto Steam and which ones get to stay there.</a> This time, the controversy centers around a free solitaire game called Flick Solitaire, with Valve accused of removing the game from Steam in Russia over its LGBTQ+ themed card decks at the request of the Russian government, while other digital platforms ignored the government's request.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, Flick Solitaire had been available in Russia on the iOS store and the Google Play Store since 2020. However, shortly after it was released on Steam in October 2025, Russia's censorship body, the Roskomnadzor, sent messages to Valve, Apple, and Google, all requesting that the game be removed from their platforms for "<em>promoting non-traditional sexualities</em>."</p>



<p>While Apple and Google both ignored the request, Valve succumbed to it, not only removing the game from Steam in Russia, but also pointing its finger at developer Flick Games for not following "<em>applicable laws</em>" in a country in which it was publishing its game. Flick Games points out that Russia is not the only country that has laws criminalizing LGBTQ+ people, in which Flick Solitaire is available, and in all of those scenarios, Flick Games has never dialled down or censored the LGBTQ+ content included in the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Flick Solitaire, it has been available in 40+ countries that criminalize LGBTQ+ people. Russia is only one of these,</em>" said Ian Masters, Flick Games founder. "<em>As we started adding decks that celebrated Pride, or were created by out queer artists, we did not self-censor in any of these countries. It's incredibly important that LGBTQ+ people in these countries can see that other LGBTQ+ people exist, that it's 100% normal and should even be celebrated</em>."</p>



<p>According to the report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's notice at all. Apple sent a note to Masters acknowledging that it had received the notice from the Roskomnadzor, but affirmed to Masters that the notice had not impacted the studio's standing with Apple and on the App Store. Flick Solitaire is still, at the time of this writing, available on both the Google Play Store and the App Store in Russia.</p>



<p>Valve is the only platform that buckled under the pressure applied by Roskomnadzor, which, as Video Games Industry Memo points out, isn't exactly a huge amount of pressure. That said, Flick Solitaire is allegedly not the first game Valve has removed at the request of the Russian government. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">report from PC Gamer claims</a> that Valve removed 260+ games from Steam at the request of the Roskomnadzor.</p>



<p>"<em>This isn't 'wokeness', it's basic human rights and equality and nothing more</em>," said Masters on the importance of protecting LGBTQ+ content on platforms like Valve. "<em>If Steam can't support free speech of LGBTQ+ people, then at the very least they should be transparent about this</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-thinking-about-non-hollow-knight-games/</link>
            <guid>1367725</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry is almost three months removed from finally releasing Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games ever and one of 2025's best releases. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">sold millions of copies</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">earned five nominations at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year. After seven years of development and such a roaring success, you might think Team Cherry is taking a bit of a break to reap its rewards. Not so, it would seem, as the small studio is already working on DLC for Silksong, and has begun thinking about games outside of the world of Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>All this comes from a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, which includes a solid chunk of spoilers for Hollow Knight Silksong, so if you've not finished Silksong yet, but want to hear how Team Cherry is reacting to how the game was received, be prepared for spoilers. </p>



<p>On the topic of non-spoiler territory and on DLCs, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier asked about Steel Assassin Sharpe, Ari Gibson said, "<em>Just waiting in the wings. Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them</em>."</p>



<p>Schreier immediately followed up by asking if the Village of Lions was part of its DLC plans that were tucked away and are now waiting in the wings, to which Gibson responded, "<em>We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going</em> <em>to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be</em>."</p>



<p>As far as when these extra bits of content and DLC updates are coming, the truth is that Team Cherry is not sure. "<em>We didn’t plan seven years for </em><em>Silksong</em>," said Gibson. "<em>Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding what Team Cherry will do after Silksong, Gibson and William Pellen, the other half of Team Cherry's core, both admitted that they have ideas for what would be next. The question is how much longer they have in this life to get to them.</p>



<p>"<em>We haven't thought that much about the time, but we've thought about the ideas that we have, the stuff we want to make and put in there</em>," said Pellen. "<em>And then we do have other games that we plan to make</em>," Gibson continued. </p>



<p>"<em>The only time concern really is - and we've talked about this before - death. It's not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it'd be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have said we'll go elsewhere,</em>" Gibson added. "<em>Although we've also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That's not to say we won't return to these Hollow Knight worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don't want to be exclusively people that make Hollow Knight</em>."</p>



<p>That said, Gibson was quick to clarify that he and Pellen aren't sick of making Hollow Knight. Gibson said that if they were forced to make another Hollow Knight game right now, "<em>it'd be a joy.</em>" The drive to go beyond the games that made Team Cherry a household name in the industry is rooted in their own creative endeavours to try something new. </p>



<p>"<em>It'd be interesting for us to explore the same things we're interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with. We're interested to see what would happen ourselves</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warframe: The Old Peace Gets December 10 Launch Date; Android CBT Live Now]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/</link>
            <guid>1367722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes announced that Warframe is getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-the-old-peace-in-2025-tau-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Peace update</a> on December 10 across all platforms. The Old Peace represents the next Narrative Chapter for the ongoing Warframe storyline, but it also introduces two brand new game modes to shake up the gameplay experience.</p>



<p>The first one, called Descendia, is a roguelite-style, weekly-rotating Tower mode where players descend through increasingly challenging levels in pursuit of rewards. Progression allows for deeper starting floors and varied loot each week, keeping things fresh. </p>



<p>The second is Perita Rebellion, a time-limited '12-minute war' mode that challenges players or squads to complete as many randomized objectives as possible on the moon Parita before facing a bespoke boss fight. Players will face intense time pressure and must therefore make robust use of the new movement options, such as the enhanced grappling. Perita Rebellion's bosses are randomly assigned and include encounters with the Prime Vanguard and other unique enemies. This mode will also have players fending off the Anarchs, the newest enemy faction added to the game.</p>



<p>Another big new addition brought by The Old Peace is the introduction of the Tauron Strikes into Warframe. This is a set of five all-new Focus School Ultimates, unlocking legendary artifact weapons (e.g., sword, hammer, staff), which can then be modded and enhanced through a bespoke interface. These are the Naramon Strike (Vexoric), the Unairu Strike (Cogron), and the final three that have been shown in today's devstream: Madurai's Thara, Vazarin's Nidri, and Zenurik's Lorak. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warframe | The Old Peace Official Teaser - Coming December 10 To All Platforms!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2a4_rkcbyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players will use the new Perita Rebellion resources and Focus to unlock and upgrade each Tauron Strike. These powers drastically enhance Operator/Drifter gameplay, with artifact acquisition and empowerment tightly integrated into the new game modes and narrative content, as planned by the studio.</p>



<p>A new limited-time Operation, Blood of Perita, will be available between December 16 and January 6. Players must gather Marks of Valiance from the Perita Rebellion and other Alert mission completions, found via the Star Chart map, then take these spoils to Roathe of the Devil's Triad in exchange for time-limited rewards, including the new, evolving Loyaus Chest Armour cosmetic item and an exclusive Honoria player title. This new Operation will only be accessible to players who have completed The Old Peace narrative quest.</p>



<p>Just like with most big Warframe updates, The Old Peace comes with a new playable Warframe, Uriel, who's thematically inspired by World War I and trench warfare. Uriel, the game's 63rd Warframe, introduces the bayonet class Vinquibus, a hybrid weapon that functions as both a semi-automatic primary firearm and a melee weapon, featuring fluid auto-switching between stances. Uriel's kit centers around direct, frontline aggressive combat, summoning demon minions, and activating powerful comet-style movement abilities. Urile's build paths allow for deep customization, as both the primary and melee forms can be independently modded for varied combat approaches.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TheOldPeace_Screenshot_UrielAltHelm_4K_NoLogo-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Lore-wise, Uriel originated as the Protoframe Roathe of The Devil’s Triad. This demon commander embodies the rage of a thwarted imperial takeover and temporal banishment thanks to the meddling of Dr. Entrati. Uriel can be unlocked for free by collecting the required Blueprints and resources via The Descendia. Alternatively, if you have Platinum currency to spare, you can unlock the Warframe right away from the Marketplace.</p>



<p>The Old Peace makes Warframe prettier, too. A significant visual overhaul is coming for Operators and Drifters; all their faces and hairstyles have been remastered for improved fidelity. There are even additional options for character customization. The update also features improved lighting, material fidelity, and entirely new environmental tile sets, especially for Perita, the focal moon of new lore and battlefields. The user interface and map have also been overhauled for clarity, featuring new icons and improved navigation.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the Android Closed Beta Test is out today, nearly two years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe launched on iOS</a>. You can try your luck at being selected <a href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. There's more, as Digital Extremes already confirmed the dates for TennoCon 2026. The annual convention will take place in London, Ontario, Canada, on the weekend of July 10-11, 2026, and it will also feature a reimagined TennoConcert.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio teased that Warframe fans eager for a glimpse at the next narrative chapter coming after The Old Peace should tune into The Game Awards 2025 on December 11.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fatshark Presents Darktide’s New Hive Scum Class, Confirms No PvP Plans for Now]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/</link>
            <guid>1367614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/No-Mans-Land-Screeshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>
