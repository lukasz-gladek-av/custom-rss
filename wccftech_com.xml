			<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> is due to have its third <strong>Nintendo Direct event</strong> of the year <strong>next week</strong> on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026</strong>, and it'll be a <strong>Partner Showcase Direct</strong>, if multiple reports surrounding this rumour are to be believed.</p>



<p>After first coming from known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">NateTheHate</a> (who has also predicted that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/"><strong>PlayStation State of Play</strong> is on the horizon for <strong>February</strong></a>), their report about a coming Nintendo Direct was corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">GameXplain</a>, who then added that it would be a Partner Showcase, which was corroborated by NateTheHate, and as of today, both rumours have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>Next Thursday is the predicted date, and if it is indeed a Partner Showcase, that means we can only expect to see <strong>third-party related</strong> announcements, which means we likely won't get any news at all regarding what Nintendo has coming. Instead, it'll be about what the rest of the industry is bringing to the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this Direct event does happen next week, it'll already be the <strong>third</strong> Nintendo Direct event of 2026, after the year began with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> that revealed a first proper look at <strong>Yoshi</strong> in the film, followed by a Direct event dedicated to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></strong>.</p>



<p>But if you're not looking forward to either the film or Tomodachi Life, then next week's rumoured Direct is likely the first one you might actually tune in for. We could get another look at Switch 2 exclusive titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong>, and upcoming Switch 2 ports like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong>. </p>



<p>This may even be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> announced for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and those are just some guesses at some of the bigger announcements we could see. There are also scores of potential indie game reveals that could happen at this rumoured event.</p>



<p>But Nintendo has to confirm it's actually happening before we can really start to speculate at what will be there. The last Partner Showcase Nintendo hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">was in <strong>July 2025</strong></a>, and it announced the event the day before it happened. If Nintendo sticks to that same strategy, then we should expect a reveal next <strong>Wednesday</strong>. </p>
