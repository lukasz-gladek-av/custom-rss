			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in several interviews this week. Firstly, he joined Fallout TV creator Jonathan Nolan on a panel at the Paley International Council Summit. During the conversation, the head of the Microsoft Gaming division <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-benefited-from-not-launching-with-a-new-game-says-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not having a new Fallout game ready for the show's launch was actually beneficial.</p>
<p>The executive then stopped by Bloomberg's New York City office for another interview. As reported yesterday, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> there is effectively no limit to porting Xbox games to other consoles following the launches of Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, and the announcement of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. He also confirmed the existence of an Xbox handheld project (which, however, will take years to complete) and suggested more acquisitions might be possible, especially if it is an Asian developer.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg interview</a>, Spencer gave a subtle dig at Sony's controversial pricing of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>, saying the market won't grow with consoles that cost $1K.</p>
<p><em>I feel pretty good about where this industry is going. To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.</em></p>
<p>The basic PS5 Pro costs $699, but if you add the optional vertical stand and the disc drive, the price increases to over $800. That's twice as much as the launch price of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony's previous mid-generation console refresh. The PS4 Pro included a disc drive (but not a vertical stand).</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't mentioned anything about a mid-generation console refresh for the Xbox Series S|X. They did it for the Xbox One, of course; the Xbox One X launched a year after PS4 Pro, offering far better hardware at a slightly higher price ($499). Microsoft probably calculated that due to the rising manufacturing costs, it would have to offer a console with similar, if not even higher, pricing than the PS5 Pro and decided it wouldn't be a good idea to launch such a console on the market.</p>
<p>Besides, Microsoft isn't really focused that much on consoles anymore. While they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a next-generation console delivering the biggest leap ever (likely with the help of machine learning), their real approach is fully multiplatform, as evidenced by the push on cloud and other consoles.</p>

			<p>The latest models of the iPhone are pretty capable when it comes to handling high-end games, and developers are working to take full advantage of Apple's A17 Pro and A18 Pro chips. We are now hearing that Capcom is readying its Resident Evil 2 remake for the iPhone and iPad, with the release date set for December 10, possibly a day after the company releases iOS 18.2 to the public.</p>

<p>To be precise, it will be Capcom's fourth Resident Evil game for the iPhone and iPad and only one of the few AAA games you can play on your iOS or iPadOS device. When Apple announced on stage that it would bring PC games to the iPhone, people presumed that the company would port the titles to a more handheld version. However, the capability of the iPhone's latest chips has proved to be more significant than we previously expected.</p>
<p>The company released a full-fledged version of the PC game for the iPhone and not a stripped-down 'lite' version. The games were brought to the mobile experience without any cuts or edits, and they remained the same as they were on PCs or consoles. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-a17-pro-gpu-features-ray-tracing-metalfx-upscaling-resident-evil-iv-remake-village-assassins-creed-mirage-coming-to-iphones/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was another title that made headlines when the company offered it on the iPhone with full controller support and stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil 2 remake will be released on iPhone on December 10. At this stage, the company did not mention how much the game would cost, but it did say that it would be just like other titles. You will be able to download the game free from the App Store and play the trial version absolutely free of charge. If you wish to continue playing and move out of the demo version, you must buy the full game.</p>
<p>If we presume that Capcom would remain true to its word, we can expect the price of the Resident Evil 2 remake to be between $19.99 and 59.99, similar to its existing titles. If you are excited to play the popular title on your mobile device, it is worth noting that only the latest iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models will be compatible, along with last year's iPhone 15 Pro models with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ipad-mini-7-decent-gaming-tablet-for-running-resident-evil-4-remake/">A17 Pro chip</a>. If you have a compatible iPad or Mac, you will still be able to enjoy the game and make use of cross-progression to continue where you left off on another device.</p>
<p>You can register for Resident Evil 2 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432">App Store</a> right now. We will let you guys know when the title hits the App Store. We will be covering the performance of the game on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so be sure to keep an eye out.</p>
