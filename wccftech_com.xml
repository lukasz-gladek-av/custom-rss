			<p>Housemarque's next game, Saros, would never have been possible if the studio remained independent, according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Speaking with Finnish publication <a href="https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000011045895.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helsingin Sanomat</a>, Housemarque CEO Ilari Kuittinen commented on the acquisition of the studio by Sony, saying that it brought some cultural changes to the studio, such as having to conform to Sony's HR practices, but also more financial resources that have allowed the developer to move to new offices, and effectively make Saros possible, as Housemarque would have never been able as an independent studio to invest as much as was needed for the development of the game, which entered full production in 2022. While the game's budget hasn't been revealed, it is, according to Helsegin Sanomat, close to Alan Wake 2's budget of 70 million euros.</p>
<p>Saros was officially revealed during February's PlayStation State of Play with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">cinematic trailer</a> that provided some hints about the game's setting and story. While very little is currently known about the gameplay mechanics, the information provided so far suggests Saros will be built upon the mechanics that power <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">Returnal</a>, featuring a world that is constantly reshaped upon each death but also permanent progression systems that will help players overcome the many challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>Saros is now in development for PlayStation 5. The game will launch sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>Today, Krafton unveiled the 2025 roadmap for PUBG: Battlegrounds. A year after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game's transition from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, it finally provided an update on the task.</p>
<p>This is meant to establish a new long-term foundation for the game while retaining the same feeling that fans have appreciated. The UE5 upgrade, though, still needs time in the oven, as it was described as being in the pre-production phase. On the tech front, Krafton is also busy making the long-requested current-generation version of PUBG. This is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X in late 2025, delivering visual improvements as well as a more optimized experience for frame rate and map loading speed.</p>
<p>The developers are also preparing to launch the PUBG UGC (User Generated Content) project. This will allow players to create and share their own custom experiences, starting with a new TDM-style mode in Custom Matches. This initiative is designed to give players greater creative freedom and expand the ways in which they interact with the game.</p>
<p>A more unified experience across Normal Matches, Ranked, and Esports is coming, too, thanks to the integration of key elements from Normal Matches into Ranked, reducing the gameplay gap between the two modes. To further enhance progression, a tier overhaul is planned for June, making rank progression feel more rewarding and meaningful.</p>
<p>Balance patches will be released every two months in 2025 to address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. In addition, a major annual rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage different play styles. Alongside these changes, under-utilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and SMGs will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also in development to further expand the arsenal available to players.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will also be majorly overhauled, making PUBG bots behave more realistically and strategically. AI enemies will react to the shrinking blue zone, take cover more effectively, and even use smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These improvements are designed to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</p>

<p>While a new map won't be coming to the game this year, the developers are preparing a big world update due in late 2025. This update will transform existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while retaining the essence of what players love. Moreover, the Destructible Terrain feature is being introduced in the Taego, Miramar, and Erangel maps.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Krafton continues the fight against cheaters. New detection technologies are being developed to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics. The team is also exploring ways to leverage Windows OS protections to provide an additional layer of security against exploitative software.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are being actively used to detect and counter unauthorized software use in real time, improving PUBG's ability to identify and ban cheaters more effectively. Additional security measures are also in development to better protect player accounts and reduce the risk of account hijacking and unfair play.</p>
