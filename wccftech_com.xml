This wouldn't be the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">first time</strong> something like this happens: Ragnarok's beginning was also hidden inside the files of 2018's God of War.</p>



<p><em>"A hidden cutscene with what I think are beings from the higher plane and Athena talking about Odin and Atreus. There is also another character called 'Robed Figure', who says 'To lefkó fídi tha se fáei.' Greek for 'The white snake will eat you.' I believe this Robed Figure is Athena herself before revealing her face, similar to how Baldur was called 'The Stranger' and Freya was called 'Hermit Witch' before their names were revealed,"</em> the user reported.</p>



<p id="p-rc_48febe1567f298e5-26">The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hidden cutscene</strong> also features Atreus as he travels to other pantheons with an individual called <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Mau."</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"This being communicates only by saying the word 'Mau', similar to how Groot speaks by saying only 'I'm Groot', and people can understand what he's saying.

<p><em>"One failed us. One rejected us,"</em> the <strong>Robed Figure</strong> says to <strong>Athena</strong> in the cutscene, likely referring to <strong>Odin</strong> who failed them, and <strong>Atreus</strong>, who has rejected them, setting up a <strong>very interesting stage for the next entry</strong> in the series.</p>



<p>As the next God of War game has yet to be officially announced and is likely still a few years away, there's no way to know if these <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">newly discovered cutscenes</strong> will indeed be the basis of the next <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em></strong>.

			<p>Veteran game designer <strong>Jake Solomon</strong>, known mostly for <strong>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</strong>, <strong>XCOM 2</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-midnight-suns-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a></strong>, announced the closure of <strong>Midsummer Studios</strong>. Solomon had founded the development team after leaving <strong>Firaxis</strong>. In 2024, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed him to learn more about his next game</a></strong>, a narrative-driven life simulation for which he had already raised $6 million in seed funding.</p>



<p>Rather than going for a traditional sandbox-like approach in the vein of the king of the genre, <strong>The Sims</strong> from <strong>Maxis</strong>, the game was conceived around player-driven storytelling. <strong>It was a systems-based approach where conflict, relationships, and consequences would combine to generate compelling, episodic personal stories</strong>. Characters would have jobs, love lives, and competing desires, with failure treated not as a dead end but as a narrative opportunity, in the spirit of improv theater. <strong>There would be no game-over screen</strong>.<br>The game was designed to be <strong>open-ended and ongoing</strong>, with <strong>no fixed conclusion</strong>, and Solomon expressed hopes that a thriving modding community would emerge over time. It would have been a single-player experience only, built in Unreal Engine 5 with a stylized visual approach, deliberately designed to keep the team small and the production sustainable.</p>



<p>The closure announcement came directly from Solomon, who <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a post on X</a> and also shared a brief Pre-Alpha footage of the game, which was codenamed "<strong>Burbank</strong>":</p>



<p><em>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios, I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into. It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</em></p>



<p><em>We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Solomon later admitted that <strong>Burbank's characters used AI for memory, reasoning, and speech</strong>, allowing players to create any characters they wanted and drop them into any story. The art, however, was entirely human-made.</p>



<p>It's yet another closure at a dire time for the gaming industry. Just yesterday, <strong>Sony</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, the maker of the <strong>Demon's Souls remake</strong>. However, Solomon's studio has perhaps more in common with the <strong>"extinction level event"</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was mentioned by <strong>Denis Dyack</strong></a>: the failed <strong>$2 billion deal</strong> between <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and <strong>Savvy Group</strong>, which <strong>flooded the market with prototypes of AA and AAA games</strong>, thus making it much harder for indie studios to get funding.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 Sells 1M Copies, Is the Fastest-Selling Game in the Series; Franchise Reaches 10M Units Sold]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/</link>
            <guid>1441435</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>KOEI TECMO</strong> and <strong>TEAM NINJA</strong> announced that <strong>Nioh 3</strong> has already become a <strong>million-seller</strong> and is, to date, <strong>the fastest-selling game in the action RPG series</strong>. We previously had a glimpse of the game's early success in its concurrent player peak on Steam, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which far surpassed its predecessors'</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Another side is the very strong critical reception, which is being celebrated with a dedicated accolades trailer that <strong>prominently features our own review score (9.8/10)</strong>. Earlier this month, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in great detail</a> why he felt <strong>Nioh 3 is the Japanese developer's best work yet</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The only real downsides are the performance issues, although that's not exactly surprising given that <strong>KOEI TECMO and TEAM NINJA have historically always struggled in this area</strong>. In Wccftech's technical analysis and graphics tuning guide, Sebastian Castellanos <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-pc-graphics-tuning-guide-how-to-get-the-best-experience-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Frankly, Nioh 3 underwhelms when it comes to its achieved balance between visual fidelity and performance — and that’s disappointing for a AAA PC title released in 2026. Despite generally strong reviews for its combat systems and world design, the PC port still carries forward some of the same technical shortcomings that plagued previous Team Ninja releases: subpar optimization on both the CPU and GPU, and an engine that struggles to present a stable experience unless the game is locked to fixed framerates.</em></p>



<p><em>The Katana Engine’s sensitivity to non-standard framerates results in noticeable judder and uneven camera motion when your framerate isn't holding at a steady framerate figure, and many players are still reporting performance issues even on fairly powerful hardware. These issues are not minor tweaking details — they are foundational to the core gameplay feel, and it’s frankly unacceptable that a AAA 2026 PC release ships in this state, requiring players to lock framerates or rely heavily on upscaling/frame generation just to achieve a semblance of stability.</em></p>



<p><em>In short, while Nioh 3 unquestionably has depth and quality in its combat and systems, those strengths are strongly let down by a technical package that feels unfinished and insufficiently optimized. In the modern PC landscape — where much better-looking titles offer solid uncapped performance, smooth frametimes, and correct behavior with fluctuating framerates — Nioh 3 feels like a step backward. Until game updates from Team Ninja or community mods address these issues in a meaningful way, getting a truly impressive visuals to performance balance out of this game remains an uphill battle.</em></p>
