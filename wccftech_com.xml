			<p>These rumors came after an awkward accident happened when sending around a marketing email regarding World of Warcraft's latest activities. However, the most surprising part that had people getting their hopes up was a link to join <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/">Game Pass</a>, with a subject line that read as the following: "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" Screenshots of this email were posted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox subreddit</a>, where there is no denying World of Warcraft was added to the advertising, and it certainly didn't seem like it was accidentally, either.</p>

<p>With this email beginning to circulate, this led to a lot of excitement and buzz about the potential of World of Warcraft being added to Game Pass, and the wishes that the game would also be launching on console. However, hopes were quickly dashed by Microsoft, after they gave an official reply on X.</p>
<p>"This was a mistake on our end. Sorry for the confusion! Blizzard's World of Warcraft was accidentally included in a Game Pass email even though it's not available with the service - a correction email will be sent to those who got the original email soon."</p>
<p>Of course, the replies under this post were quickly filled with people pleading with Microsoft to just add World of Warcraft to Game Pass already, with some even saying that they've already tested the game on the controller and found that it worked just fine.</p>
<p>The images that were added to the promotion in this email were very suspicious, as it didn't appear to just be a case of accidentally mentioning the game. As seen on the Xbox subreddit, it included promo material for the Plunderstorm event, with art from World of Warcraft combined with the classic Xbox and Game Pass theming.</p>
<p>While it may seem that World of Warcraft isn't coming to Game Pass any time soon, the email definitely is suspicious and will most likely continue to cause a stir for a little while, despite Microsoft putting out their official reply.</p>
