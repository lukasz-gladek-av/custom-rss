			<p>The PS5 Pro is fast approaching, and with it comes a ton of enhanced games that will be released on the console, offering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-pssr-is-a-game-changer-to-bring-visual-fidelity-to-the-next-level-says-insomniac/">new graphical fidelity</a> options and upgrades to make it a worthwhile experience to play on that console rather than the ordinary PS5. The list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games is already pretty hefty and continues to grow. As a matter of fact, it's double the list of games that the PS4 Pro had when it launched. When the PS4 Pro launched, it had over 40 enhanced games, with the console being released in November 2016. So far, the PS5 Pro has a <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/03/ps5-pro-enhanced-games-double-than-ps4-pro-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed list of over 80 games</a> thus far, with the console officially launching on November 7.</p>
<p>There is already quite a hefty list of games that will be available on the PS5 Pro, with quite a few of them bound to be a smoother experience overall than the experience you'd ordinarily have on the PS5. This is due to updates and hardware that will help make the game run smoother. While PC has generally been seen as the advantageous platform to choose from, in modern days, games typically run better on console at launch, as there is a lot less to consider when patching the game and making updates for compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that games will look or even feel better on the PS5 Pro, but you'd certainly hope so, as that is what you're paying for. It will be a matter of "wait and see," but there is a great catalog of games available for those who are planning on picking up the new and improved PS5. Some of these games had some issues on the PS5 when the titles were released, so it'll be interesting to see that once the PS5 Pro comes out, they will have improved performance after all. It's worth noting that some of these games haven't been released yet, so the PS5 Pro enhancements at launch apply to the launch of the game in this case rather than the console.</p>
<p>Games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Demon's Souls, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered are some that will be ready for the PS5 Pro when it launches and will provide new graphical updates and smoother performance. Considering that there were complaints about performance for both Dragon's Dogma 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it will certainly be interesting to see if the PS5 Pro version of the game helps to improve it in any way.</p>

			<p>Human staff have been the victim of recent layoffs over at Netflix as they begin to close down some of their game studios. This includes their triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, which was founded by Chacko Sonny, a former Overwatch Executive Producer. However, Netflix has decided to close this studio and has now admitted that the video game division of the company is investing in generative AI. This is supposedly to "accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players." This will come like an extra kick in the teeth for those who were part of the layoffs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/">the studio closure</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Mike Verdu, the Vice President at GenAI for Games at Netflix, used the post to announce his new title. "I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite certain how 'good' the AI is that is being used in game development. When it comes to generative AI that's used in artwork, it's still very obvious when the pictures are AI. Whether it be due to weird hands or same-face syndrome, there's always a level of uncanny valley. Whether this kind of thing will translate over to games as well is something that we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Verdu's statement continues with, "Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition," he says. Despite that, it doesn't make the fact that a studio has been shuttered and 35 people lost their jobs any better, especially if their plan is to replace their efforts with AI.</p>
<p>At this point it's uncertain what the plan is for the use of generative AI in the video game department over at Netflix. There is a lot of possibility and potential for it, as generative AI game engines are coming out, and the AI can be used to create concept art, voice performances, in-game dialogue and much more.</p>
<p>"I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams," says Verdu.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the use of AI in the games industry? Do you think this move will work out for the Netflix game department? Let us know in the comments.</p>
