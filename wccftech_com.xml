			<p><strong>Tom Clancy's The Division</strong> initially launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on March 8, 2016, meaning that March 8, 2026, will mark the 10-year anniversary of the series launch. It's not entirely clear how <strong>Ubisoft</strong> intends to celebrate the occasion yet, but a poster spotted at the esports event, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6JP/status/1996490814843740451">FPS Day,</a> in Japan seems to have one indication of how, as event attendees shared pictures of a <strong><em>"The Division: Definitive Edition"</em></strong> poster online.</p>



<p>Shared to X (formerly Twitter) by multiple users, a large poster for The Division: Definitive Edition that seems to be legitimate was shared ahead of a 10th anniversary panel taking place at the event.</p>

<p>A 'Definitive Edition' of the first Division game has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, though we do know that there are several projects within the series in the works. At last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> executive producer <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong> shared some new information and gameplay on The Division 2: Survivors and The Division Resurgence, two upcoming titles that were first announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>.</p>



<p>He also spared <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">a few words for <strong>The Division 3</strong>,</a> saying, "<em></em><em>It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear what the 'Definitive Edition' of the initial game will look like, particularly because Ubisoft has already been adding new features to The Division to help celebrate the game's 10-year anniversary, like a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505">60 FPS update for current-gen consoles that was released almost a month ago</a> at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>A video shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/2010628433223545297">official Ubisoft Japan X (formerly Twitter) account</a> also details how the company will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first Division game with a special in-game event in The Division 2, but there's no mention of a 'Definitive Edition' for the first The Division game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this 'Definitive Edition' is a new version of the first Division game set to release for current-gen platforms, then we may only be hours away from the official confirmation at the aforementioned 10th anniversary panel. Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on what's happening, but did not receive a reply ahead of publishing. We'll update this article if/when we hear back.</p>
