			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> has officially found yet another cast member, and this time it's <strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll recognize from Apple's hit show <strong>Severance</strong>, who has been tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong>.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">Deadline</a>, but Wccftech readers who've been following our coverage of the show as casting ramps up ahead of a reported <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">March 2026 filming start</a></strong>, we already had our suspicions that Ólafsson would be picking up Mjolnir. A report from a website called <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> had previously identified Ólafsson for Thor, which has now been proven to be correct, after it had already been proven correct about casting for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now that those three casting choices were proven to be more than just rumours, it gives more credence to the report's fourth casting rumour, which was that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as <strong>Mimir</strong> for the show. As a fan-favourite character, keeping Duncan for the role of Mimir would go a long way with fans who remain unsure about the upcoming God of War adaptation.</p>



<p>Ólafsson now officially joins <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong>, and <strong>Max Parker</strong> in the cast, with Hurst being tapped to play Kratos, Palmer for Sif, and Parker for Heimdall. We still don't have a casting confirmation, or even a rumour for key roles like <strong>Atreus</strong>, <strong>Baldur</strong>, and <strong>Freya</strong>, but hopefully those will be revealed soon, if filming is still set to begin in March. </p>



<p>The show is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>, who signed on as showrunner after the original showrunners and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> had a falling out</a> in terms of the direction they wanted to take with the show.</p>



<p>While we still don't have concrete plot details for the direction the show will take, hopefully, some of the success that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout</a></strong> show has had will rub off on this upcoming God of War series. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[“I Can’t Fully Trust Anywhere Now”: GDC Reports 1-in-4 Devs Have Been Laid Off in Last 2 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> has <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially been published</a> by the <strong>Game Developers Conference (GDC)</strong>, which surveyed over <strong>2,300</strong> <strong>developers</strong> in an attempt to put a finger on the pulse of the game industry, asking developers about a range of topics, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/">Generative AI</a></strong>, the epidemic of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">mass industry layoffs</a></strong>, which kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">video games are dominating the industry</a>, and more.</p>



<p>When reading the report, it's always worth remembering that there are hundreds of thousands of developers not surveyed here, and that with GDC updating its survey process every year, it doesn't present a complete picture of where the industry is at. That said, just like how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">SteamDB</a></strong> numbers don't show the full picture of an individual game's success, that doesn't mean the information is useless.</p>



<p>Information like how, among developers surveyed by GDC, <strong>1-in-4 have been laid off in the last two years</strong>, and out of those laid off developers, <strong>nearly half of them are still struggling to find a job</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>According to our survey, 17% of game industry professionals reported being laid off in the past 12 months, while 11% said they were laid off during the 12 months prior (lining up with our 2025 survey data). Altogether, that means over one-fourth (28%) of respondents have experienced a layoff in the past two years, increasing to one-third (33%) for those in the United States</em>," the report reads. </p>



<p>"<em>Of those who’ve experienced a layoff, almost half (48%) said they haven’t found another job yet. This includes 36% of game industry professionals who were laid off 1 to 2 years ago."</em></p>



<p>Industry churn and layoffs are an unfortunate reality for any industry; game developers certainly aren't alone in experiencing turbulent times in their industry of choice. But layoffs are short-term, band-aid solutions that only make a positive impact on a company's bottom line, while making a negative impact everywhere else. </p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been laid off so many times in the last 5-6 years, had so many turbulent issues working in games. I have trauma and <strong>can’t ever fully trust anywhere now</strong></em>," said one of the developers surveyed. <strong>23%</strong> of those surveyed anticipate layoffs in the coming year, and another <strong>30%</strong> remain unsure. That's a majority of developers who can't say with certainty that they'll have job stability, even if they know they are good at what they do.</p>



<p>"<em>The market has been so challenging I’m not sure I’ll remain in games</em>," said another respondent. Meanwhile, the next class of developers currently in school looking to join the industry don't see much hope for their own prospects. <strong>3-in-4 game development students surveyed are concerned they won't be able to find a job</strong>, while <strong>87% of their teachers surveyed</strong> believe their students will struggle to find work.</p>



<p>When companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/">Meta</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-layoffs-nearly-all-areas-western-offices/">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon,</a></strong> to name just a few, lay off their employees by the tens, hundreds, and thousands at a time, not only are those companies and their teams losing talented developers, but each layoff is one more traumatizing event that might make someone decide they won't come back to games. Young developers coming into the industry lose proper mentorship because there aren't any veterans around to mentor them, and the developers who survive each layoff are left with more work to be done in less time, leading to more crunch and developer burnout. None of those things contributes to an industry that can produce better and more entertaining games for players.  </p>



<p>As one particularly blunt student put it, "<em>There aren't any jobs. Everyone's getting fired. It's f***ed."</em></p>

			<p><strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has debuted a new gameplay overview trailer for <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>, the long-awaited open-world action adventure game that began its life as a completely different game from what will launch on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">March 19, 2026</a></strong>. The 15-minute-long showcase highlights the game's story, which follows its protagonist <strong>Kliff</strong>, and shows off the five distinct regions of Pywel, the game's vast open-world setting.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">When Pearl Abyss first revealed Crimson Desert</a>, the plan was for it to be an MMORPG for the next generation of consoles and PCs. That was seven years ago, and the next-gen is now the current-gen, and just a year into that plan, Pearl Abyss decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/"><strong>entirely overhaul the direction of the game</strong>.</a> After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple delays</a></strong>, the team is finally ready to release the single-player open-world adventure, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/">just last week confirmed that the game had officially "<em><strong>gone gold</strong></em>."</a></p>



<p>Today's new overview, which you can check out below, is an in-depth look at the game's story, which follows Kliff, a Greymane warrior who fights to protect the innocent and his fellow Greymanes like they're his own family. Our story with Kliff begins shortly after the peace he and his fellow Greymanes were enjoying is shattered, and he embarks on a journey to take back his homeland and reunite his lost Greymanes, but within that quest, he discovers a darker conspiracy at play.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That darker element is the Abyss, a realm that holds incredible amounts of power, power that some are looking to exploit, which further drives the Abyss towards imbalance and threatens to harm the rest of the world if Kliff can't put a stop to it first.</p>



<p>Nothing about the story seems necessarily groundbreaking, but that's perfectly fine so long as it's executed well. Besides, while the game's narrative might be the vehicle that carries players through the land of Pywel, the engine driving everything is its wide exploration and gameplay variety.</p>



<p>You'll be able to explore five regions that make up the setting of Pywel: <strong>Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia </strong>and the<strong> Crimson Desert</strong>. Each region has its own stories and environment, with players being free to explore the world of Pywel in any order they choose.</p>



<p>The overview also shows off the two other playable characters beyond Kliff, which you'll unlock as the story progresses. It also features a quick look at the mix of fantasy and sci-fi embedded within Crimson Desert, since you'll be able to jump from classic sword and shield medieval combat to flying around in a giant missile-launching mech.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Pearl Abyss has packed a lot into Crimson Desert, and today's overview didn't even go too in-depth on the game's combat.
