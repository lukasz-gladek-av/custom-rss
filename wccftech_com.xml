			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will launch in late May on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, publisher Bandai Namco confirmed today.</p>
<p>The co-op survival adventure developed by FromSoftware will launch worldwide on May 30th. Besides the game's Standard Edition, multiple editions of the game will also be released on the same day, including additional goodies such as Digital Artbook and Soundtrack for the Deluxe Edition and the Seekers Edition, which will also include an additional Steelbook. The real star of the Elden Ring Nightreign special editions, however, will be the Collector's Edition, which includes every goodie included in the Deluxe Edition, the same Steelbook included in the Seekers Edition, eight Nightfarer Cards, a hardcover Artbook and a ~25 cm Wylder Nightfarer statue. Die-hard fans of Elden Ring will also be able to purchase a 1:1 scale, prop-quality replica of the Wylder character helmet. Only 9,999 pieces of the helmet will be produced, so it will be a rather exclusive item. All the game's editions and the Wylder helmet replica are also available for <a href="https://it.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now?utm_campaign=Preorder-EldenRingNightreign&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_source=SM_Official" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order</a>.</p>
