			<p>Goichi <strong>"Suda51"</strong> and <strong>Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> require no introduction, as they have developed some of the quirkiest games ever released on PC and consoles. After working on new entries in the <em>No More Heroes</em> series and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/"><strong>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</strong></a></em>, the legendary game designer and his studio began working on <strong>Romeo is a Dead Man</strong>, their <strong>first IP in a very long time</strong>, which looked like a Suda51 game through and through, even <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture-studio-reveals-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-ps5-in-2026/">in its announcement trailer.</a></strong></p>



<p>The game's unmistakable feel was also evident in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/"><strong>short demo I was able to check out during Gamescom 2025</strong></a>, with intense action and an overall artistic direction that I have found close to <strong>Quentin Tarantino's style</strong>, something I told Suda51 himself when I had the chance to speak with him about <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em>.</p>



<p>Besides saying that he <span>is often told this,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank"><strong>Suda51 also discussed</strong></a></span><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> how the game's story and setting were heavily inspired by Back to the Future and FBI TV shows.</strong></a> I couldn't see much of this influence in the Gamescom demo, but after playing through the game's first two chapters in a more relaxed setting, these influences are difficult to ignore. It is difficult not to notice how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> has the potential to become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best games ever made</strong> by the Japanese development studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Romeo-is-a-Dead-Man-Preview-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Romeo is a Dead Man's story can get weird at times, but it's surprisingly engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Suda51, "Romeo is a Dead Man" was inspired by a <strong>"what if" scenario from Back to the Future: what if Marty McFly died?</strong> What would have Doc Emmett Brown done? He would have gone back in time and saved Marty. And this is precisely what <strong>Benjamin Stargazer</strong> does to save his nephew Romeo, returning to the moment he was going to be killed by a mysterious creature, fitting him with the <strong>Dead Gear Life Support System</strong> to save his life.</p>



<p>This, however, creates a <strong>Time Paradox</strong> which shatters the space-time continuum, transforming reality into a <strong>chaotic multiverse</strong>. To restore the world, the <strong>FBI Space-Time Division</strong> recruits Romeo, who becomes an agent under the name of <strong>DeadMan</strong>. Traveling through space-time, Romeo will not only pursue some heinous space-time criminals, but also seek his girlfriend, <strong>Juliet</strong>, who appears to be connected to the major crisis that has disrupted the entire universe.</p>



<p>If this premise sounds a little confusing to you, you are not alone. In its first two story chapters, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> feels like a mish-mash of very diverse concepts, where the aforementioned influences are blended with a gameplay formula that's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">markedly Suda51</strong>. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hack-and-slash</strong> experience is fairly straightforward, combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">melee and gun combat</strong> in a simple yet effective way, enriching both with unique mechanics such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloody Summer</strong> - an all-powerful attack that can be unleashed once enough blood has been gathered - <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Bastards</strong> - special skills unleashed by friendly enemies with a lot of different offensive and support effects - and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">shoot weak points</strong> on certain enemies to deal massive damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210180216_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Boss fights in Romeo is a Dead Man are set to be one of the highlights of the experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the game's very first chapter is essentially the entirety of the Gamescom 2025 demo set in a swamp area ending with a boss fight against one of the many <strong>versions of Juliet</strong> roaming space time, it's the <strong>second chapter</strong> that proved to be the most surprising, to me. Following some story sequences aboard <strong>The Last Night</strong> ship, which serves as the central hub, rendered with a <strong>top-down view and 16-bit visuals</strong>, Romeo is sent to his baptism of fire in an <strong>abandoned mall</strong> to seek out a space-time fugitive who has been wreaking havoc across time.</p>



<p>It's in this mall that the very diverse ideas behind <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> started coming together. While the <strong>Dead Rising inspiration</strong> was evident throughout the stage, fighting zombie-like enemies using newly unlocked weapons like the <strong>fists and heavy sword weapons</strong>, unleashing Bloody Summer to restore health in a bind, and jumping between real space and <strong>Subspace</strong>, an alternate dimension accessed by using an <strong>old TV set</strong> showing a mysterious individual making almost nonsensical philosophical commentary, to reach power generators scattered all over the place is quite fun, thanks to a somewhat <strong>intricate level design</strong> that makes it easy to look past the relative linearity of the game's world. As is the battle against the space-time criminal, who turns into the massive <strong>Enhanced Phantom</strong> whose diverse moveset puts Romeo's battle skills to the test, forcing him to move between <strong>two different floors</strong> to avoid powerful area-of-effect electric attacks.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210181909_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The shifting art style is one of the features that defines Romeo is a Dead Man</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As highlighted by the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Back to the Future</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dead Rising</em> inspirations, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> often feels like a <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">celebration of entertainmen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> media as a whole</strong>. The references are scattered everywhere, even in Romeo's progression systems, which include a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">minigame that plays like a classic labyrinth arcade game</strong> from the 80s to increase his stats, and a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pong-like minigame</strong> that must be completed to pinpoint the next space-time anomaly, and thus criminal to take down. All of this does make the experience feel a little messy, but it's undeniable that it also gives <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">certain charm</strong> that is too often missing in modern AAA video games.</p>



<p>With the game's first two chapters being so markedly different from one another, I really can't wait to see what else <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> has in store, and if the quality on display in the first hour or so of the game will hold up for the rest of the experience. If it does, I am confident the game has the potential of becoming <strong>one of the best games ever made by Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> when it launches on <strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/"><strong>February 11</strong>.</a></p>

			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> was released in a rather poor state in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2020</strong> which required <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">multiple updates to fix</a></strong>, the story was always considered to be among the game's strongest points. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, however, has long <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">remained one of the most controversial parts of the game's engaging story, especially the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage</strong>&nbsp;that propels&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong>&nbsp;to the top of the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Night City</strong>'s&nbsp;mercenary world, setting the stage for the heist that would put</span> the proper story in motion.</p>



<p>For a long time, it has been speculated that the <strong>half-year montage replaced cut content</strong>, but that is not the case, as <strong>Act 1</strong> was reportedly designed the way it was from the beginning to avoid a <strong>meandering, unfocused experience</strong> that would have made most players bounce off the game.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077's</em></strong> sequel creative director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Igor Sarzynski</strong> commented on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, detailing why extending it wouldn't have made for a better experience, making an interesting comparison with the first movie in the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Star Wars</em></strong> trilogy: "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">No, it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tatooine</strong> with farmer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Luke</strong> before he got involved with all this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jedi stuff</strong>,"</em> Sarzynski said.</p>



<p>Besides, extending the story of <strong>Act 1</strong> wouldn't have necessarily extended playtime for most players, as with <strong>open-world games</strong>, players are free to choose their own pace. More interestingly, however, the <strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> creative director highlighted how the motivation in this portion of the game wouldn't have made for an engaging experience.</p>



<p><strong><em>"The motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in a meandering, unfocused experience,"</em></strong> Sarzynski explained.</p>



<p>In another message, the sequel creative director provided further clarification on this motivation being too vague:<em> <strong>"Do jobs, make money, make reputation" - ok but what for? what are you trying to achieve? there would have to be a more specific goal for this section. 'Do stuff' without a clear hurdle to clear would make a lot of players bounce off the game."</strong></em></p>



<p>This isn't just a vague prediction, according to <strong>Sarzynski</strong>, as building reputation <strong><em>"is not a specific, measurable goal. and it's not about my opinion, we have telemetry, UX lab, survey data."</em></strong> Feeling that a good balance was also struck in regards to the time to bond with <strong>Jackie</strong>, Sarzynski ultimately confirmed that the <strong><em>"half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this</em>."</strong></p>



<p>Given <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">that&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>&nbsp;remains one of the most hotly debated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">topics in Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em>, the community's opinion on the ma</span>tter appears to be generally at odds with the way this story segment has been designed. Some like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcleansix.bsky.social/post/3mbpbvdf27k2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew C. McLean</a></strong> feel that the in-game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation rating</strong> would have made the "reach the top" goal more tangible. </p>



<p>While setting a goal like reaching a certain level is not the kind of storytelling <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CD Projekt Red</strong> wants to do, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sarzynski</strong> admits that something of the sort would have been doable, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em>"it would require a significant rewrite and introducing a storyline that contextualizes and structures this getting to the top."</em></strong> </p>



<p>Likewise, others would have loved to experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong> reaching the top, or spending more time with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jackie</strong>, although in some ways, not having had that much time with this likeable character made the events of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">heist</strong> even more impactful.</p>



<p>Considering how it's possible to spend so much time in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Night City</strong> completing meaningful content that further fleshes out the franchise's universe, I understand why the developer made some sacrifices to keep the narrative pace tighter. However, it's undeniable that, for a first playthrough, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage can feel disappointing</strong>. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see if the community's opinion on this matter will influence the development of the <strong>second entry in the series</strong>, which promises to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">an even bigger game.</a></strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Demo Launches Tomorrow; Save Will Carry to the Full Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-demo-launches-tomorrow-save-will-carry-to-full-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese publisher <strong>Square Enix</strong> has revealed that a demo of <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> will be available tomorrow (<strong>January 7, 2026</strong>) on all platforms. Data from the demo's save file can be transferred to the full game, allowing players to continue where they left off. Moreover, everyone who plays the demo will receive the 'Day Off Dress' costume for Maribel to use in the final game.</p>



<p>We first heard about a Dragon Quest VII remake in July 2025, when a rumor <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> a potential 2026 or early 2027 launch</strong>. <span>The official confirmation came just a couple of months later, in September 2025, when, during a Nintendo Direct</span>, Square Enix&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;the planned release date of&nbsp;<strong>February 5, 2026</strong>,&nbsp;for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With this remake, the publisher has gone in an entirely different direction than with the recent <strong>HD-2D</strong> style featured in the <strong>Dragon Quest I–III remakes</strong>. Square Enix collaborated with developer <strong>HEXADRIVE</strong> (<strong>Monkey King: Hero Is Back</strong>, <strong>Voidcrisis</strong>) to craft a <strong>hand-painted diorama aesthetic</strong> that treats the game world as a miniature landscape populated by three-dimensional, doll-like characters. The character models themselves derive from actual physical dolls created during development, a deliberate choice to evoke <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>'s original character designs.</p>



<p>In a slightly controversial move, Square Enix <strong>deliberately cut three entire islands</strong> and converted four others to optional sidequests, directly addressing <strong>the original's bloated 100+ hour structure</strong>. However, new content compensates: expanded character backstories, a new Kiefer scenario, and hints at an alternative ending absent from prior versions. The game now also supports non-linear progression, allowing players to tackle episodic arcs in varying order once the tablet fragments have been collected.</p>



<p>The signature vocation system also received a comprehensive redesign in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. The 50+ vocation roster is now streamlined to 20 per character, with "Moonlighting" enabling dual-vocation equipping and simultaneous progression. Most critically, the Career Sphere menu eliminates the dreaded mandatory backtracking to Alltrades Abbey. Monster vocations are now Monster Hearts (accessories), while a new Monster Master vocation consolidates scattered abilities. Lastly, the producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-feature-a-brand-new-ending-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>there is a new ending in the remake</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting tomorrow with the demo, everyone will be able to experience some of these changes firsthand and judge for themselves. By the way, Square Enix has also just released the opening movie of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>
