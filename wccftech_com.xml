			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days on the market. The news <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> from Nintendo itself, which also confirmed that the Switch 2 is now its fastest-selling console ever when considering this timeframe.</p>
<p>This early result certainly won't surprise industry analysts, who have been forecasting that the Nintendo Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever in gaming history. DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that 15 million units could be sold by the end of this year, and that was with the looming shadow of Trump's tariffs. Without that, DFC Intelligence reckoned it could reach 17 million units.</p>
<p>Of course, any console's track record is a marathon rather than a sprint, but the new hardware certainly started off strong. Reception has also been very positive so far. On Wccftech, Chris Wray praised the new system in many ways in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, I thoroughly recommend the Switch 2. Like the Switch, it's a great console with a mixture of handheld and regular. This feels sturdier, and the quality of life improvements are far stronger than you may think when simply reading about them. Still, even though I overwhelmingly recommend the Switch 2, if you already have a Switch, I would probably hold out for an offer, which you likely will need to, and for a few games to pad out the abysmal launch line-up. Then again, I got this the same day as people buying it did, so I know you're going to have to wait because it sold better than stolen gold at the Swiss Bankers Convention.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>
