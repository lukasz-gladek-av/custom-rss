			<p>Over a year ago, <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its MMORPG <strong>Elder Scrolls Online</strong> would transition from the expansion-like Chapter model to a seasonal model. However, 2025 was a transitional year in which the so-called <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a></strong> still retained some elements of the Chapter model.</p>



<p>It is only now that the studio is launching the proper Seasons model, which will go live on <strong>April 2, 2026</strong>, with <strong>Season Zero: Dawn and Dusk</strong>. The reveal came today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3KEv1KkCZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a livestream</a> that we at Wccftech, alongside other outlets, were able to watch in advance.</p>



<p>Right away, one big change is that for the first time in the history of Elder Scrolls Online, an update (specifically <strong>Update 49</strong>) will be released simultaneously on PC and consoles. This is a necessary first step toward cross-play, which the studio is still working on, although it will take some time to achieve it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons-Roadmap_Infographic-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Game Director <strong>Nick Giacomini</strong>, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a> after he took over from <strong>Rich Lambert</strong>, emphasized that the team has frequently heard from players that the game has become more predictable lately. This change <strong>can make the game more rewarding and exciting</strong>, he said, and the Chapter model limited ZOS because it took a long time to produce, leaving little room to react to player feedback or address longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Updates and content will still arrive quarterly, but ZOS is moving Elder Scrolls Online away from the templated and stale release cadence of a dungeon pack, a new featured zone, another dungeon pack, and so on. This model also lets the developers keep iterating on the core game. Perhaps one of the most significant changes is that <strong>all new content coming to the game will be free starting with Season Zero</strong>. No longer will there be barriers to playing a new Trial or dungeon with friends. </p>



<p>The goal is that each season may look completely different. Seasons will happen four times a year, be three months long, and each will contain a <strong>Tamriel Tome</strong> and access to the <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>. Tamriel Tomes are the game's version of a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>Each season has a unique Tome available for the full season. Everyone has access to the free version and progresses by completing weekly and seasonal challenges to earn Tome Points, unlocking pages and choosing rewards. By the way, ZeniMax Online Studios is reworking Daily Login Rewards and the Endeavors system within Tamriel Tomes. There are also <strong>two paid premium upgrade options for Tamriel Tomes</strong>. These unlock additional tiers of rewards (cosmetics, personalities, mounts). With the premium options, players can continue unlocking pages even after the season ends.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Tamriel-Tomes_Infographic.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>, on the other hand, is a new in-game store dedicated to earnable rewards. This is a consistent place to claim limited-time cosmetics you might have missed in the past (events, Twitch drops, etc.), which is something the Elder Scrolls Online community had long requested. Items in the Bazaar are purchased with <strong>Trade Bars</strong>, which are earned primarily in the Tamriel Tomes but also through regular gameplay.</p>



<p>The developers also revealed they're getting rid of <strong>Event Tickets</strong>. Players with existing Event Tickets will receive Trade Bars in exchange. Unlike Event Tickets, there is <strong>no cap</strong> on how many Trade Bars you can hold. Trade Bars cannot be purchased with Crowns; they must be earned by playing.</p>



<p>What about <strong>ESO Plus</strong>, the current subscription model? Well, it's staying. Its price won't change and subscribers will accumulate one token for every 12 months they are subscribed, which they can use to unlock one Premium track for a Tamriel Tome of their choice. They also get a monthly grant of Tamriel Tome points and an accelerated earning rate for earning those in the game.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, Season Zero's highlight will be the first-ever <strong>Event Zone: </strong>the<strong> Night Market</strong>. This limited-time PvE zone set in <strong>Fargrave</strong> will be much more challenging than the usual zone, requiring players to group up (organically) to succeed. The zone also features a faction system. Players align with one of three factions, and there is a competition to see which faction makes the most progress. Of course, there will be various rewards, and even a brand new house with a <strong>Bank included inside</strong> for the first time. The Night Market will be available in the game from April 29 through mid-June, although the developers have opened up to the possibility of bringing it back and possibly making it permanent. Additionally, a first iteration of the optional <strong>Overland difficulty system</strong> is coming toward the end of Season Zero.</p>



<p>A new PvE group Trial called <strong>Crimson Veldt</strong> will be released in Season One, while Season Two will see the introduction of <strong>Solo Dungeons</strong>. These are one-man versions of existing dungeons, starting with <strong>Moon Hunter Keep</strong> and <strong>March of Sacrifices</strong>. Season One will also add new stories and quests based on the <strong>Thieves Guild</strong> and the Mad Daedric Prince, <strong>Sheogorath</strong>.</p>



<p>Throughout the year and beyond, the team has committed to a series of visual and combat improvements (including reduced floatiness) to enhance visuals for class and weapon abilities and improve class identity. It will start with the <strong>Dragonknight</strong> class and two-handed skill-line, then the <strong>Werewolf</strong> skill-line at the end of Season Zero, the <strong>Warden</strong> class in Season One, the <strong>Sorcerer</strong> class in Season Two, and so on.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_CombatRefresh_FieryBreath-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>But that's not all. The roadmap reveals that Season One will introduce <strong>multi-stage, dynamic world events for the first time in Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, as well as a new system called the <strong>Sage Vault</strong>. Moreover, Season Zero adds the first full-fledged <strong>PvP progression system</strong> to the MMORPG, and the studio said they are making big investments in Player-versus-Player content, including bringing back <strong>three-sided Battlegrounds</strong>, fixing spawn camping issues in maps like Mor Khazgu, adding ways to get around the Cyrodiil RvR map faster, and fixing Alessia, Ash, and Chalman keeps to stop players from <em>slingshotting </em>into inner keeps.</p>



<p>Before Season Zero: Dusk and Dawn, Update 49 will go live on <strong>March 9, 2026</strong> with the following quality of life improvements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Free Respecs:</strong> You can respec skills and attributes directly from the UI at no cost.</li>



<li><strong>Guild Traders:</strong> Return to the 30-day listing window.</li>



<li><strong>Outfit Slots:</strong> These are becoming account-wide.</li>



<li><strong>Riding Training:</strong> Faster training duration.</li>



<li><strong>Attribute Points:</strong> You can now add stat increases in bulk (three at a time) rather than one by one.</li>



<li><strong>Mounts for Gold:</strong> Adding a brand new mount for gold and moving 16 existing Crown Store mounts to be purchasable with gold.</li>



<li><strong>Housing Limits:</strong> Furnishing limits are being increased on over half of the houses. ESO Plus members get an additional boost to limits.</li>



<li><strong>Antiquities:</strong> Longer exploration times and increased duration across all difficulties.</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, the team let it slip that it is working on <strong>Guild Mail</strong>, which the Guild Masters would definitely love, and <strong>Guild Housing</strong>, which everyone in a guild would appreciate.

			<p><strong>StarCraft</strong> is reportedly making a comeback at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>, with a recent report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a> pointing to <strong>Blizzard</strong> unveiling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-allegedly-incubating-a-starcraft-shooter/">long-rumoured third-person StarCraft shooter</a> at this year's convention.</p>



<p>Corden's report covering the upcoming year for Xbox included several claims as to what we'll see from Microsoft and Xbox in 2026, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters</a> and a claim (which was corroborated by a separate outlet) <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">that MachineGames has Wolfenstein 3 in development</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to Blizzard, Corden claimed that BlizzCon 2026 is where we'll see reveals for World of Warcraft's next expansion and updates on both Overwatch and Hearthstone and potentially new mobile titles. But none of that will be the 'big' announcement from the show, with Corden instead claiming that title will go to the reveal of the third-person StarCraft shooter coming from Blizzard.</p>



<p>"<em>The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumours true via my own sources a while back</em>," Corden writes.</p>



<p>A third-person shooter set in the StarCraft world is the exact kind of project that has the potential to bring the StarCraft franchise back to life, since it has seemingly remained dormant for over a decade. The last major release in the franchise was StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, which arrived back in July 2010 and was followed by three DLC expansions, the last of which was released in 2016. The last time we saw a new StarCraft release at all was 2017 with the release of StarCraft Remastered.</p>



<p>Since then, Blizzard has seemingly dedicated its focus to Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and World of Warcraft over returning to the popular sci-fi RTS series. A new third-person shooter would be the culmination of years spent waiting for fans who never got over the cancellation of StarCraft: Ghost, and the thing to bring back the franchise ahead of the next RTS title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/">which we last heard would be coming from Nexon instead of Blizzard</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, when BlizzCon 2026 rolls around, we'll have a new shooter to look forward to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CES 2026 Demo Footage of NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>1399855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation</strong> was undoubtedly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest gaming-related announcement</a> made by the world's largest company (by market cap) at <strong>CES 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of trailing behind NVIDIA in the upscaling department, AMD finally delivered a worthy competitor with <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4</strong> in 2025, with the year ending on a high note <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the <strong>Redstone</strong> update</a> that injected FSR with a machine learning algorithm, as well as delivering an improved <strong>Frame Generation</strong> algorithm and the brand new <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong> (an analog to NVIDIA's <strong>DLSS Ray Reconstruction</strong>) and <strong>Radiance Caching</strong> (seemingly similar to NVIDIA's <strong>Neural Radiance Cache</strong>, although it is not yet ready for release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fsr-radiance-caching-requires-further-development-optimization-is-not-currently-planned-release-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>).</p>



<p>Less than a month later, NVIDIA answered in kind with the release of its <strong>second-generation transformer model</strong> for the DLSS Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 has been trained on a much larger and higher-fidelity dataset, and as such, utilizes five times the compute power; that's why the initial tests have shown older <strong>GeForce RTX</strong> graphics cards struggling with it.</p>



<p>Luckily, those PC users can still use the older models, either the CNN one or the first-gen transformer model, which run games noticeably faster. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 is not really about increased speed - that's what Dynamic Multi Frame Generation helps with, but more on that later - <strong>it is instead about delivering the highest possible quality</strong>. This model demonstrates its power through a deeper understanding of game scenes and a more intelligent use of game engine pixel sampling and motion data, delivering output images with improved lighting, sharper visuals (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as demonstrated in an early <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> comparison</a>), and enhanced motion clarity.</p>



<p>We had our very own CEO, Abdullah Saad, attending CES 2026 and checking out the various NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 demos available at the booth. He was particularly impressed by the lighting improvement delivered by the new transformer model in the game <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and the NVIDIA rep explained:</p>



<p><em>There's a very technical reason for that. The engine does the math in what's called physical space, which is like how the physics actually operates. It's not thinking in terms of gamma and stuff like that. It's thinking basically in real life math, like the light goes here, this light is at this amount of nits, and then at some point down the pipeline, it gets tone-mapped and ported to your display. The older DLSS, preset K, is accumulating the data at the end of that, so after tone mapping. It's losing some of that data, the highlights for example, and it's accumulating on that. TAA (Temporal AntiAliasing) can also have that problem, but here we move the new one closer to the engine so it's seeing more of what the engine is trying to show as far as the lighting goes, so it's losing less of that highlight detail.</em></p>



<p>In more technical terms, the previous upscaling algorithm worked in logarithmic space to mitigate flickering, but resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. Now, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the same space used by games, and is thus capable of allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. This could be an indirect been to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR gaming</a></strong> under NVIDIA DLSS 4.5.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The other half of the NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 announcement, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, won't be available publicly before Spring 2026, but it could be tested at the NVIDIA CES 2026 booth. Beyond unlocking <strong>6X mode</strong> (five additional frames rendered apart from the real one), the update will also introduce <strong>an intelligent system capable of targeting your specific display's maximum refresh rate</strong>. </p>



<p>In the CES 2026 demo (featuring <strong>Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2</strong> game), the system was shown targeting the 240Hz of the 1440p display on hand. The NVIDIA rep stated:</p>



<p><em>If you went to a scene where it went up to 300 FPS, you'd see it lowering the multiplier because you'd be generating frames that are just being thrown out, right? This is a smarter way to use it. If you go up to one of the windows, the scene will get a lot lighter. You'll see your frame rate go up, and then it'll start lowering the multiplier because it'll know that you don't need that much frame generation. If you go over here, your frame rate will drop because this is a more intense scene and it's going to start raising the multiplier again.</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also promises <strong>improvements in frame pacing and better accuracy in rendering in-game user interfaces</strong>, as shown in the official video above. The former will be particularly important, although we'll have to wait for its public release to test it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the popular <strong>DLSS Swapper</strong> tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-swapper-version-1-2-3-1-released-with-support-for-dlss-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just been updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</a>.</p>

			<p>On top of Windows Central's claim that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters/remakes would arrive "<em>eventually</em>,"</a> its executive editor, Jez Corden, also added more to the rumour mill on what Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones developer MachineGames has on the go. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">According to the report</a>, the studio is working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game, while also having Wolfenstein 3 "<em>on the cards</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, this time it's not just Windows Central claiming that Wolfenstein 3 is in development. Shortly after the initial Windows Central report, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku published its own</a>, corroborating what Windows Central claimed and, based on conversations it had with its own sources, went as far as to <strong>confirm that Wolfenstein 3 is in fact currently in development.</strong> </p>



<p>It's not shocking to hear that a new Wolfenstein game is coming from MachineGames. <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">Back in September 2025,</a> when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">NoClip</a> released a documentary on the making of the first two games, studio head <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> said, "<em>We have always <strong>seen this as a trilogy</strong></em>. <em>That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one</em>. <em>I think that's important to say, because⁠—at least I hope⁠—we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. <strong>We have a story to tell.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>If that's not a comment meant to prime players for a coming sequel, then there's no telling what is. Gustafsson would have made that comment, fully aware of when the documentary was to be released, with full knowledge of what the studio had coming. Today's reports add further fuel to the fire that we are indeed going to get a third, and seemingly closing chapter of BJ Blazkowicz's story.</p>



<p>The last Wolfenstein game was 2019's Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which focused on Blazkowicz's daughters instead of BJ himself. If a new game in the series arrives this year, it'll have been a seven-year gap since the last game in the series and a nine-year gap since the last game to feature BJ as the protagonist. </p>



<p>Along with a new game seemingly in the works, there's also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">a TV show adaptation of Wolfenstein coming from Amazon</a>, which could likely be revealed at the same time as the third game.</p>



<p>As for the multiplayer game Corden mentions, there's not much else to go on besides the quick description that it is meant to be a "<em>Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title</em>," though if Wolfenstein 3 is going to be ready in time for the coming TV show, then that may be the project the studio is closer to completing. While the idea of a new multiplayer game from MachineGames is exciting, fans of the studio would much rather the team focus on BJ Blazkowicz before anything else.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more official news to share from the studio itself soon.</p>
