			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the Greatüñï) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>‚Äî Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>

			<p>Techland has <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1972959300436865280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a major hotfix patch for Dying Light: The Beast, updating the game to version 1.2.3. The update improves a performance issue related to stuttering when NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (or Multi Frame Generation), which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-shows-an-aging-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in my technical analysis of the game</a> as very annoying during gameplay. </p>



<p>The other highlight is that the Polish studio has recognized the absolutely overpowered grabbing ability of zombie Biters and balanced it so that it is less frustrating. That's also something I noticed right away when playing and indeed, the PC community <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-five-pc-mods-to-improve-your-dying-light-the-beast-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already provided fixes through mods</a>. Even though this is now fixed in the base Dying Light: The Beast, other mods are still worth downloading.</p>



<p>Here's the full changelog for Dying Light: The Beast 1.2.3:</p>



<p><strong><em>Stability &amp; Performance</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed various crashes to improve overall game stability.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where sharpening was not applied correctly while using DLSS.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed occasional stuttering when playing with Frame Generation enabled.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed graphical glitches when using HDR on PlayStation 5.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Gameplay Improvements</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grabbing Biters is now less frustrating and feels more fair.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where patrolling routes of Screamers in Dark Zones were broken.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Quests &amp; Progression</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tutorial:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a critical issue where, if a player received a modded weapon from someone who had already completed the tutorial, the game attempted to apply the mod a second time, thus blocking the progress.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>The Mine (Co-op):</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where destructible doors could remain indestructible for one player, blocking quest progression.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Safe Spots:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a bug where breakable doors and windows respawned after reloading, trapping players inside.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Mental Asylum Safe Spot: Fixed an issue where reloading the save could leave the entrance blocked by an unintended obstacle, preventing players from entering.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where music could loop infinitely after reloading certain quests.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>UI &amp; Consoles</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed the missing ‚ÄúJoin the Community‚Äù button on consoles.</em></li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 1 Starts October 28; Roadmap Unveiled]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled.1312654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive) announced that Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin on October 28 and feature free new content for all players.</p>



<p>The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, and new weapons. The second phase, California Resistance, begins on November 18 and includes a map located in Southern California called Eastwood, as well as a Sabotage mode designed for 8v8 combat. The final phase of Season 1, Winter Offensive, begins on December 9 and includes a seasonal map update to Empire State and a themed event.</p>



<p>Blackwell Fields' map includes support for all combat sizes, land, and air vehicles. The backstory is that, right after the end of the single player campaign of Battlefield 6, double agents from the antagonist faction Pax Armata launch a series of attacks on NATO targets, starting at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands. The new Strikepoint mode is an intense, small-team tactical mode in which a squad fights another squad over multiple rounds to capture a key objective. Each round, players have only one life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase one's additions also include:</p>



<ul>
<li>APC Traverser Mark 2 - A land vehicle that suits four players: one driver, one roof gunner, and two side gunners. </li>



<li>SOR-300C - A low rate of fire carbine rifle chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform‚Äôs 5.56 version.</li>



<li>Mini Fix - A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle</li>



<li>GGH-22 - A high-capacity and fire rate sidearm</li>



<li>Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments for rifles and LMGs</li>
</ul>



<p>The Eastwood map will support all Battlefield 6 combat sizes, land vehicles, and helicopters. The setting is described as a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course. In Sabotage mode, players must destroy as many sites as possible before time runs out. Each team has one offensive and one defensive round; ultimately, the team that successfully detonates the most sites wins the match.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase 2 will introduce the Battle Pickups feature to the game. These are high-tech, powerful weapons that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Players will have to scour the maps to find where they're located if they want to exploit the advantage they bring. Other additions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>DB-12 - A dual-barrel pump-action shotgun</li>



<li>M327 Trait - High-damage (but low rate of fire) sidearm with eight rounds. This revolver is powerful in close quarters but has a significant damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</li>



<li>Troy Angled - This grip attachment offers an alternative for underbarrel choices</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, in the final phase of Battlefield 6 Season 1, Winter Offensive, players will see a seasonal visual update to the Empire State map, where temperatures are now freezing. To go with that theme, there's also a limited-time Ice Lock event centered around a mechanic called Freeze (though this will only be active in specific experiences). Finally, a new melee tool, the Ice Climbing Axe, will be introduced to the shooter game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you plan to play Battlefield 6 on PC, you can now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-battlefield-6-geforce-game-ready-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get the NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/world-of-warcraft-midnight-on-vosu-revele-la-date-de-sortie-et-le-contenu-de-ledition-collector-60600">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> reveals that the upcoming World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion will launch on February 26, 2026. The report also claims that the collector's edition for the expansion is set to cost ‚Ç¨139.99, and will include extras like three days of early access to the expansion, 30 days of game time, and more.</p>



<p>This report comes just ahead of a live stream presentation the World of Warcraft team at Blizzard is set to give tomorrow, October 1, 2025, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT on YouTube and Twitch, detailing new information about World of Warcraft: Midnight. Following that, the alpha test for WoW: Midnigh is set to begin the next day on October 2.</p>



<p>It's possible that Billbil-kun has beat Blizzard to the punch, and announced the release date ahead of tomorrow's presentation, where it will be officially announced, along with the collector's edition and other details about WoW: Midnight.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight was first revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">last month during Gamescom 2025</a>, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">Wccftech was able to catch up with Paul Kubit, associate game director at Blizzard and Jade Martin, lead combat systems designer,</a> about what players can look forward to with World of Warcraft: Midnight.</p>



<p>You can check out that interview above to learn more while you wait for tomorrow's live stream, where we're sure to see even more about what's to come in Midnight when it arrives next year.</p>
