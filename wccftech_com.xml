			<p>Exactly two years ago, Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment released Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, an open world action/adventure game set in the fictional world created by James Cameron's movies.</p>



<p>Despite the hype surrounding the combination of the developer behind the successful The Division franchise and such a high-profile intellectual property, which grossed over $5.2 billion in film sales alone, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora didn't receive the warmest welcome from either critics or gamers. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch rated it 7.5 out of 10, noting that it was a remarkable technical achievement, but the combat often felt frustrating. The game didn't set any new sales records, either.</p>



<p>That said, it has a second wind to exploit now: the upcoming release of the third movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, scheduled to be available in theaters from December 19. That's why Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is going to launch a new expansion called From the Ashes</a> on that same day. </p>



<p>In the meantime, though, they just released the big 2.0 free update. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> a few months ago, it includes the long-requested third-person view modes and New Game+. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-leak-shows-new-images-game-likely-to-be-first-person-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ever since the first leaks</a>, it was clear that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would be a first-person only game, but that's changed now, potentially opening up the experience to all those players who can't or won't deal with first-person motion, due to sickness or sheer preference. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Following the patch, players can seamlessly switch between first and third-person by pressing the J key on PC, holding the touchpad on PlayStation 5, or holding the View button on Xbox Series S and X. As for New Game+, it allows you you carry over all of your gear and skills from a completed playthrough and even get access to a new skill tree for the Sarentu, as well as higher level gear. As you'd expect in such a mode, you will face more challenging enemies.</p>



<p>But that's not all that the developer has added in Update 2.0. There are several notable additions from a technical standpoint, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 (the latest transformer model, although the previous CNN model can still be selected), DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-2-now-enabled-in-44-games-more-titles-coming-soon-enhanced-ai-upscaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XeSS 2</a>, XeSS Frame Generation, and AMD FSR 4, though the latter can only be enabled by AMD users at a driver level, not in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>



<p>That said, Massive shared a few known issues related to Frame Generation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Crash on startup when XeSS Frame generation is enabled.</li>



<li>Frame Generation cannot be activated while the Steam Overlay is on.</li>



<li>FSR3 Frame Generation causes stuttering when used in Borderless Fullscreen.</li>



<li>Switching from Borderless to Fullscreen while Frame Generation is on causes the framerate to drop significantly.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, those can be fixed soon.</p>
