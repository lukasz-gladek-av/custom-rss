			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 looks to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great third-party developer support</a>, with many recent titles announced for the upcoming hybrid console. One of these titles is Sid Meier's Civilization VII, which launched a couple of months ago to lower-than-usual reviews for the traditional king of the 4X turn-based strategy genre. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score</a>, whereas previous entries had all scored above 9.</p>
<p>The good news is that Civilization VII will perform nicely on the Nintendo Switch 2, at least according to the development team. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/switch-2-civ-vii-hogwarts-legacy-hades-ii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Game File</a> during the press hands-on event, Dennis Shirk (Executive Producer at Firaxis Games) said:</p>
<p><em>We were able to make this look like a mid-tier PC, because it's got enough power. We are extremely happy, and it's been easy. Their software development kit is great, the customer support, their developer support, developer relations is great. They knew they wanted Civilization VII on that platform because it’s such a great showcase for the mouse. And it pairs up so well with our existing PC audience because we have crossplay.</em></p>
<p>Civilization VII is actually already available on the original Switch, but it will look much better on the Nintendo Switch 2 (not to mention the mouse-like support enabled by the new Joy-Con 2 controller). The same goes for Hogwarts Legacy.&nbsp; Jimmie Nelson, Senior Producer for Tech, VFX, and Lighting at WB Games / Avalanche Software, stated:</p>
<p><em>We originally started with our Switch version. We got very good results really quickly, but we felt like we could make a higher quality product if we brought in a lot of the high-resolution assets and raised the resolution, textures, lighting, and world streaming.</em></p>
<p>The version available for the original Switch introduced mandatory loads between certain zones, such as before entering Hogsmeade. However, this limitation has been removed on the Nintendo Switch 2, thus making this new version feel more seamless. Both games will be part of the launch line-up when the Nintendo Switch 2 debuts in stores on June 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-4-cyberpunk-tech-demo-pushes-rtx-4090-hard-lumen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.5 tech demo inspired by Blade Runner and other Cyberpunk works is now available for download, allowing users with the proper hardware to experience how much Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections, alongside other ray tracing features, can enhance visuals.</p>
<p>The tech demo, which can be downloaded here, was created by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dyr4K3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pasquale Scionti</a>, who originally aimed to create a Cyberpunk scene using only dynamic lighting and, as such, used no Lumen, no path tracing, and no ray tracing in the original UE 5.3 version of the demo. The developer has now released a new version of the demo created powered by Unreal Engine 5.5.4 featuring Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections as well as Hardware Ray Tracing for Ambient Occlusion, Reflections, and Shadows, which looks downright stunning. All of this, however, comes at a cost in terms of performance, as even a powerful GPU like the RTX 4090 can run the demo at 60 FPS only at 1440p resolution, proving once again how hardware is still not ready for demanding advanced lighting tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Standalone Cyber Streets Tech Demo Engine 5.5.4 Lumen / RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlx3VsWqjkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.5, which is the latest major version of the game development engine by Epic, has been used by multiple developers to power up some interesting projects, which include unofficial remasters of<a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-stunning-unreal-engine-5-5-zora-river-demo-is-now-available-for-download/"> Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim</a>, although performance leaves something to be desired in most cases, even on powerful hardware. According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, when Unreal Engine 5 launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-gpus-two-generations-behind-rtx-6000-well/">GPUs were two generations behind</a>, and it will only be with the RTX 6000 series that games powered by the engine will run well, so it will be a while longer until framerates won't have to be sacrificed in the name of better visuals.</p>

			<p>An upcoming Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition mod will introduce significant ray tracing improvements to the game.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/badassbaboon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a>, BadassBaboon, a known GTA V modder, confirmed that an exclusive Enhanced Edition feature is currently in the works for the V: Definitive Edition mod that will improve ray-traced reflections. Reportedly, assets were not updated in the latest version of the popular open-world game to take advantage of the new ray-traced reflections, and, as such, the mod will improve puddles, reflective surfaces, glasses, and windows across the map. The modder also shared some work-in-progress screenshots, which can be found below.</p>

<p>Though Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition isn't perfect, it is a stunning upgrade to the open-world game by Rockstar and, most likely, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">a preview of the ray tracing features</a> we will see in Grand Theft Auto VI later this year. The CPU load of ray-traced global illumination, however, is yet another strong indication that we will have to wait until the PC release to experience the new entry in the series in all of its glory at high framerates, as it's very unlikely consoles will be able to push beyond 30 FPS with RTGI.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC, complete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features not available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</a> You can learn more about the new upgrade by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece.</a></p>

			<p>Multiple Nintendo Switch game prototypes have leaked online, including prototypes of an unreleased Ridge Racer game and a canceled RPG that was in the works by Metroid Prime series' developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>According to multiple online<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jtcjcr/several_switch_dev_builds_has_leaked_from_devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a>, the prototypes leaked online after they were found in a devkit, and include old Splatoon 2 debug builds, the Nintendo Switch version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a>, an unreleased Lego Civilization game, an ARMS debug build and prototypes of a new entry in the Ridge Racer series and of Retro Studios' canceled Project Harmony music RPG which was reportedly in development after the studio released Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Metroid Prime Remastered. Footage of the latter two games was also shared online and can be found <a href="https://streamable.com/2mkoof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Project Harmony and below for the Ridge Racer prototype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An early build of the cancelled Ridge Racer game developed by Bandai Namco Studios Singapore has been leaked online, built on Unreal Engine 4! This dates back to January 6th, 2017.<br>
Here's footage of the game build in action!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RidgeRacer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RidgeRacer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BandaiNamco?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BandaiNamco</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UE4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UE4</a> <a href="https://t.co/YhqS3a1vWu">pic.twitter.com/YhqS3a1vWu</a></p>
<p>— Jesse Young (@resethepicture) <a href="https://twitter.com/resethepicture/status/1909086888616747239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given Bandai Namco's strong relationship with Nintendo, it is not surprising to see that the collaboration between the two companies was leading to the return of the Ridge Racer series on Nintendo Switch. While the game has been canceled, the collaboration between the two companies still continues to this day, as Bandai Namco is working with Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai on Kirby Air Riders, which is launching this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. A collaboration that is hardly surprising, considering Sakurai-san teamed up with Bandai Namco for the development of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U &amp; 3DS and Ultimate.</p>

			<p>A Minecraft Movie has shattered expectations at the box office, proving the strength of the IP created by Mojang and owned by Microsoft. Whereas estimates assumed it could earn around $150 million globally, the videogame adaptation actually opened up to $157 million earned in the United States and $144 in the rest of the world, for a grand total of $301 million throughout the whole weekend.</p>
<p>This set a new record, improving upon Nintendo's and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $146.4 million across the United States in its first three days in theaters. Of course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie continued its run to earn <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $500 million in its first week</a> and $1.36 billion at the end of its box office run. We'll have to wait and see if A Minecraft Movie has the same legs, but so far, the indications are very positive.</p>
<p>The movie was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and the company's chiefs, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, wasted no time expressing their elation at the news:</p>
<p><em>We’re absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world. A Minecraft Movie’s decade-long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP’s Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.</em></p>
<p>The film was directed by Jared Hess and features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel House, and Jemaine Clement. Jack Black plays Steve, who is the default player character skin in the game.</p>
<p>The success of A Minecraft Movie will likely spur even more videogame adaptations across film and TV. That said, it's worth remembering that Minecraft is the best-selling game ever, with over 350 million copies sold to date. As such, this adaptation's successful release is not necessarily indicative of other intellectual properties.</p>
