			<p>The next-gen Xbox system will be <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium and high-end experience</a>, but it sounds like the experience won't be the only premium element of the console. As suggested by known AMD insider Kepler L2 on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/">NeoGAF forums</a>, the price of the system could easily hit well above the $1000 mark, due to a few reasons, including its high bill of materials, which is considerably higher than that of the Xbox Series X.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000">Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" Bill of Materials May Push its Price Well Beyond $1000</h2>



<p>Commenting on the next-generation system, which will be powered by the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">AMD "Magnus" APU</a>, the known AMD leaker, who has provided accurate information in the past and pointed insights into upcoming AMD hardware, said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270918219">the price of the next Xbox will 100% be over $999.</a> </p>



<p>As things stand, the system's bill of materials (the raw cost of the physical system) is over twice that of the Xbox Series X, which is currently $650. As if this weren't enough, if the next-gen Xbox Magnus will indeed support Steam and 3rd party stores as rumored, Microsoft won't be able to subsidize selling the system at a low or near brea-even price with the guaranteed 30% cut on every game sold on the system.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-gen-xbox-magnus-high-price-may-impact-sony-s-playstation-6">The Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" High Price May Impact Sony's PlayStation 6</h2>



<p>The high price of the next generation Microsoft system, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/">current perception of the brand</a>, which is at an-time low following price increases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Xbox hardware</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass service</a>, and the cancellation of multiple projects which have led to studio closures and multiple waves of layoffs, may also impact the PlayStation 6 and Sony's general strategy for the next generation.</p>



<p>Asked about the possibility of the release of a PlayStation 6 Digital Edition without a disc drive at a lower price that the main edition of the system, Kepler L2 said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270919867">it would only be possible at a significant loss</a>, as the Japanese company essentially no longer has competition, considering the current state of the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Although the next-gen Xbox may end up being one of the most expensive gaming systems ever released, the system has a high chance of being the most powerful to date as well. Judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">leaked system specifications</a>, the console won't massively outperform the PlayStation 6, but will still be able to offer the premium version of the performance the Sony system will offer, something that would definitely fall in line with recent statements from Xbox CEO Sarah Bond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 is out and in players hands, EA and Battlefield Studios are ready to look to what's next for the game, beginning with its Season 1 update, which comes with three stages of updates that'll carry Battlefield 6 through to the end of this year.</p>



<p>Season 1 for Battlefield 6 begins on October 28, 2025, and ahead of that arrival, I got the chance to get a closer look at everything that's coming to the game beginning October 28 all the way through to December 9, and go hands on with the new modes, vehicles, maps, and weapons that'll be added throughout Season 1.</p>



<p>As a note, I got ample time to review and go over the details EA shared of what's coming in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, and only three hours to play the new content for myself. I also had time to go over the details before I went hands-on with the Season 1 content, which is why the first section of this preview is an overview of everything broken up by each of Season 1's main updates, followed by my impressions.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-1-preview-thumbs-up-for-new-conquest-maps-thumbs-down-for-the-new-modes">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Preview - Thumbs Up for New Conquest Maps, Thumbs Down for the New Modes</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-leadoff-rogue-ops">The Leadoff - Rogue Ops</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Season 1 will last for at least the rest of 2025, but all of Season 1's content won't arrive in one big batch on October 28. It'll arrive in three separate content updates, with Rogue Ops on October 28, California Resistance on November 18, and Winter Offensive on December 9. </p>



<p>Starting with Rogue Ops, the key additions of which are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blackwell Fields (new map)</li>



<li>Strikepoint (new game mode)</li>



<li>Traverser Mark 2 (new ground vehicle)</li>



<li>SOR-300SC (new carbine weapon)</li>



<li>GGH-22 (new sidearm pistol)</li>



<li>Mini Scout (new sniper rifle)</li>



<li>Rail Cover and LPVO (new attachments)</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest addition that comes with Rogue Ops, only because Rogue Ops is the first of Season 1's updates, is the addition of Battlefield 6's battle pass. The battle pass will have four different paths for players to work through, each with their own free and premium rewards. It's EA and Battlefield Studios' attempt at giving you more choice, so you're working towards the rewards you want sooner, instead of going through a single long list of rewards, many of which you might not care about. You also get a fifth path after finishing the first four.</p>



<p>Though it's worth wondering if breaking up that one long list into five shorter ones will actually make you feel like you're not drudging through rewards you don't care about to get to the ones you do. I guess we'll find out on the 28th. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops' other two highly notable additions are its new map, Blackwell Fields, which Battlefield Studios describes as a map "<em>built for all-out warfare</em>," adding to the maps designed especially for Battlefield's signature Conquest game mode.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint is the second of the two notable additions to Battlefield 6 in Rogue Ops. It is a 4v4, no-respawn mode in which teams compete to capture a single control point. Rounds are won by either eliminating the enemy team or capturing the control point. The first to win six rounds wins the match.</p>



<p>It's a play on the classic search-and-destroy game mode we've seen for years, and it'll be interesting to see how the combat meta changes since it's not necessarily about defusing or arming a bomb, but controlling an area of the map.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-california-resistance">What's on Deck - California Resistance</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After Rogue Ops, California Resistance will arrive on November 18, bringing along with it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eastwood (new map)</li>



<li>Sabotage (new limited-time mode)</li>



<li>Battle Pickups (new gameplay feature)</li>



<li>DB-12 (new shotgun)</li>



<li>M357 Trait (new revolver sidearm)</li>



<li>Troy Angled (new attachment)</li>
</ul>



<p>Eastwood doesn't bring players to a large field for its battles, but a California suburb where you'll be running through living rooms and across suburban hills and running through a nearby golf course to try and get an angle on your enemy.</p>



<p>Unlike Strikepoint, which is a new permanent mode for Battlefield 6, Sabotage, the mode that'll be coming with California Resistance, will only be available for a limited time. Sabotage is an 8v8 mode where one side has to defend supply caches and the other attacks them, with teams switching sides between attacking and defending each round. The team that destroys the most caches the quickest wins the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, Battle Pickups are a key addition in California Resistance. They're a new form of weapons cache coming to Battlefield 6 matches that are high-powered weapons with limited ammo that can help give players an edge in a match if they find one of them.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-winter-offensive">In the Hole - Winter Offensive</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For some reason, in what I thought would be a look at everything to come in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, EA and Battlefield Studios shared no details during this embargoed preview time for Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>We know<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">, based on the roadmap image we saw ahead of the game's launch</a>, that the Brooklyn map is getting a snowy refresh as a limited-time event map, and that there will be a limited-time event called Ice Lock with the arrival of Winter Offensive. Players will also get a new melee weapon, an ice climbing axe.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But beyond that, we didn't see anything else about Winter Offensive, which was pretty disappointing. Maybe the team wants to hold something back because by then, Battlefield 6 will be going head-to-head with Call of Duty, and EA wants to have some major surprise to keep players from jumping over to Black Ops 7.</p>



<h3 id="h-hands-on-impressions">Hands-On Impressions</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the good, the Conquest variants of the new maps, Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. Admittedly, I'm a little upset that Eastwood isn't coming until November 18; it's arguably the best map in Battlefield 6, and it's technically not even in the game yet, but Blackwell Ridge is no slouch.</p>



<p>Its sunset setting and rolling hills make it a classic sniper and vehicle playground, and it's genuinely one of the most eye-catching maps in the whole game because of its constant sunset.</p>



<p>Eastwood, for its part, is just a lot more fun to run around in and has a few great hubs where battles for control points can flow throughout a match and find that sweet spot of Battlefield where there's an exciting ebb and flow to the gameplay between both sides. Also, it's just fun to drive around in a golf cart and get kills as you go.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new SOR-300SC carbine rifle is a solid addition to the arsenal though it doesn't immediately shoot up to being above my regular choices, even when I tried out different versions with all of the attachments available.</p>



<p>The Mini Scout is a different story, however, since it's arguably going to be the best sniper rifle in the game when it arrives on October 28. Easily my favourite sniper rifle to use, and incredibly powerful.</p>



<p>Overall, I'm just thrilled that the large-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge are as good as they are. Which is why the variants you play on for both the new permanent Strikepoint mode and the limited-time Sabotage modes are all the more disappointing.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint and Sabotage both took place on linear, small-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. While Eastwood retains the neighbourhood feel, with its high walls and corners to duck around, the Blackwell Ridge map is much more open and feels much less suited for the mode. Both maps have one respawn point at either end, making it easy for either team to start shooting at you the moment you respawn (particularly when playing Sabotage), and neither feels like they successfully shrunk down what's appealing about the full, large-scale map in these condensed versions.</p>



<p>The poor quality of the maps also further exacerbates the fact that Strikepoint and Sabotage are just plain boring, really. Paired with the lacking map variants, Strikepoint's play on classic search-and-destroy make it nowhere near as enticing as the best search-and-destroy game modes. I'm not asking for Battlefield Studios to add an economy system, buying weapons and armour each round, etc., just something more than a single control point in the middle of an uninteresting map (particularly the Blackwell Ridge map) that keeps the matches from becoming deafeningly repetitive and boring.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I think the switch from making it about bomb arming and defusal to making it a point you have to defend is an interesting one, but due to Strikepoint's setup of one control point in the same place every match, it was genuinely putting me to sleep during the last hour of the three-hour play session we had with the Season 1 content. It was a major letdown after having a blast playing on Conquest on two excellent new maps for two hours.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn't the part where I say, 'don't worry, Sabotage is actually fun.' It's fine. It can be a good time, particularly because the 8v8 structure allows for a bit more dynamic and chaotic combat simply because there are more people in the match, but overall, the mode didn't make for exciting matches.</p>



<p>I think part of my problem with both these modes is that neither of them is what I look to Battlefield for. It's not that I don't appreciate EA and Battlefield Studios trying new things; I just don't like what they've tried. I'm happy with the new weapons, I'm happy with the new maps, but I can live without the new modes. I'll certainly give Strikepoint another try, especially if there are better map variants for it from maps like Brooklyn, Mirak Valley, and New Sobek City. But if you're a fan of search-and-destroy, you're probably better off sticking with whatever your go-to shooter is for that mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-keeping-up-the-momentum">Keeping Up the Momentum</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been in players' hands for nearly two weeks and we're days away from its live service engine springing to life with the introduction of its battle pass, the goal for EA and Battlefield Studios is to keep the momentum that <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">its stellar commercial launch started</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see if the pacing of Season 1's content on top of everything else players already love about the game is exactly what Battlefield 6 needs to keep itself in fighting shape for when Call of Duty arrives. I think Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood will both be huge for the variety of what's available in Battlefield 6, and hopefully, for EA's sake, people like Strikepoint a hell of a lot more than I did when it arrives.</p>



<p>As a side note, while I can't wait for Eastwood, I can't help but appreciate the timing of its arrival. Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, four days before Eastwood is set to launch in Battlefield 6. The headquarters offices for both EA and Activision are based in California, not to mention Ripple Effect, one of the teams that worked on Battlefield 6, is also based in California. A map all about a battle on Californian soil launching on November 18 can't help but feel a little symbolic of what's to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-to-layoff-60-developers-amidst-a-shift-in-focus-to-%E2%80%9Csmall-screens%E2%80%9D.1331536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft RedLynx, the Finland-based Ubisoft team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-rising/">Trials Rising</a> that also largely operates as a support studio for Ubisoft projects, who recently helped Massive Entertainment bring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars: Outlaws to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to layoff 60 developers from its team in Helsinki as the studio shifts to specializing in "<em>small screens</em>."</p>



<p>A statement <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">posted on the Ubisoft RedLynx website</a> sticks to the corporate standard by not calling the cuts 'layoffs' but instead "<em>a restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company's global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company's worldwide studio network.</em>"</p>



<p>The final decision on the layoffs will be made after negotiations with the production and administration teams, who are most impacted by the proposed cuts. The RedLynx developers working on the Snowdrop Engine do not seem to be impacted by these proposed layoffs.</p>



<p>These cuts aren't just part of an effort to cut costs, as they are also part of RedLynx being reshaped from its current multiplatform focus to becoming a studio that specializes in "<em>small screens</em>," which surely means mobile devices, but also probably means the Nintendo Switch 2 and optimizing for PC handhelds, particularly after RedLynx's efforts to bring Star Wars: Outlaws to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>If implemented, the proposed changes would refocus Ubisoft RedLynx from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens,</em>" the statement reads. "<em>This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio's unique expertise, starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading</em>."</p>



<p>RedLynx began its life as an independent studio in 2000, with a focus on smaller mobile and browser titles. Its Trials series is what the studio is known for, and part of what led Ubisoft to acquire the studio in 2011.</p>
