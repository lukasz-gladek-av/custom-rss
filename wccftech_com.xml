			<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-copilot-installing-automatically-on-windows-11-pcs-now-trains-microsofts-models-on-users-pc-gameplay.1332163/">user on ResetEra spotted</a> that as part of their network traffic, Microsoft's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Gaming Copilot AI</a>, which is automatically installed on Windows 11 PCs, was sending screenshots and captures of everything they were playing back to Microsoft, so Microsoft could use that data to train its AI models further. The setting is on by default, which means that unless you turn it off, Microsoft is using your gaming time to train its AI.</p>



<p>Wccftech can confirm that when you navigate to Game Bar, and then to Settings, and Privacy Settings, the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "<em>Model training on text</em>" is defaulted to being activated. I found the setting activated on my own laptop, before turning it off.</p>



<p>There's also options for Gaming Copilot to train using any vocal conversations you have while playing games, though that was not defaulted to being 'on,' when we looked at our settings. It'll also capture personalization and memory data, and of course, keep track of any conversations you have with Gaming Copilot, if you were actually using the service.</p>



<p>You can turn all of these settings off and/or ensure they're off by going into Game Bar, then to Gaming Copilot, then the Settings gear, which should be in the bottom left corner, and then lastly Privacy settings. There, you'll be able to turn off, or at least knowingly opt in to letting Gaming Copilot train on your gameplay, instead of it being on by default.</p>



<p>In the past month or so, Microsoft has done nothing, it seems, but be a public disappointment for players. The price of the Xbox Series consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">went up in the US for the second time this year</a>, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">a price hike for Xbox development kits</a>, meaning even game devs have to pay more for Xbox hardware. The price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass went up 50%</a>, while at the same time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">reward programs</a> for Xbox software and services were shut down. And in the midst of all of that, we can probably expect a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/">version of Cloud Gaming with ads</a>. </p>



<p>Now, the latest is that Microsoft is training its AI with your gameplay, almost definitely without you strictly knowing about it.</p>



<p>None of it exactly endears Xbox and Microsoft to players, but it does at least seem par for the course for a company that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">laid off 9,000+ people to bet more on AI.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a>, a duck-filled top-down PvE play on Escape From Tarkov, has had a stunning commercial launch with more than 1 million copies sold in its first five days, developer Team Soda and publisher Bilibili Game have announced.</p>



<p>This duck-focused game arrived on Steam almost exactly a month ahead of Escape From Tarkov's Steam arrival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">which is currently set for November 15</a>. Escape From Duckov arrived on October 16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Mac App Store.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Soda is incredibly humbled to have reached such heights, and we owe this success to an incredible community of players and our friends at BiliBili Game</em>," said Jeff Chen, producer on Escape From Duckov at Team Soda. "<em>Whether you have been with us through our early days promoting the demo on Steam or are just joining to see what all the quacking is about, thank you.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of this writing, Escape From Duckov is one of the trending games on Steam, and one of the most played games right now, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/">per SteamDB</a>. Once Escape From Tarkov is out on Steam next month, it'll be interesting to see how both games fare.</p>



<p>Of course, they serve different audiences. No one is looking to Escape From Duckov for the kind of experience that Escape From Tarkov delivers. Still, it'll be fun to see if the parody is ever able to surpass the concurrent player count of the original, once we can see their numbers on a somewhat even footing, since there will surely still be plenty of Tarkov players who don't use the Steam version to launch the game. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Ubisoft Layoffs, This Time at Massive Entertainment]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx put out a statement today</a> that it was laying off up to 60 members of its staff in a restructuring to focus on "<em>small screens</em>," one of the teams that you could argue is one of Ubisoft's jewel studios for the Snowdrop Engine alone, Ubisoft Massive Entertainment, <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732">released a statement confirming its own restructuring,</a> and that it has launched "<em>a voluntary career transition program</em>," which is essentially giving employees a chance to take themselves off the board while still receiving proper severance and support.</p>



<p>"<em>As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,</em>" the statement begins.</p>



<p>"<em>To support this transition responsibly, we have introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.</em>"</p>



<p>The statement concludes with Massive Entertainment reiterating it is "<em>fully committed to our roadmap and to creating</em> <em>great experiences for players around the world, including The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Massive Entertainment's recent titles, both Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws failed to hit the mark for Ubisoft on a critical and commercial level, what can't be denied is that the studio's Snowdrop Engine is technically impressive, because if nothing else, both Outlaws and Frontiers of Pandora are two of the best-looking games this generation.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see more layoffs from Ubisoft today, even when Ubisoft tries to wrap them up in a bow by framing it as employees taking "<em>their next career step on their own terms</em>." Sure, those "<em>eligible</em>" employees might ultimately choose to leave, but being told you're eligible to leave is another way of saying you're no longer wanted. </p>



<p>Beyond the layoffs announced at Ubisoft RedLynx, we've also seen Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">push out veteran developer Marc-Alexis CÃ´tÃ©</a>, who until recently was the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise for the company.</p>
