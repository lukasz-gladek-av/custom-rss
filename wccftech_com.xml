			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-3-crimson-impressive-overhaul/">Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod</a> is now available for download, introducing so many improvements and new features that wouldn't look amiss in a real remake.</p>
<p>The mod, which is only compatible with the HD Collection version and can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycryhdcollection/mods/272?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://github.com/berthrage/Devil-May-Cry-3-Crimson/releases/tag/V0.3">GitHub</a>, allows players to enjoy the third entry in the series with plenty of new features and enhancements, including a new HUB based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">Devil May Cry 5</a> interface, updated lock-on and camera options that provide a much better view of the action, local co-op with plenty of options for an optimal experience, on-the-fly style switching, which is only available officially in the Nintendo Switch release of the HD remaster and more.</p>
<p>It's gameplay options, other than on-the-fly style switching, however, that make Devil May Cry 3 Crimson feel the most like a proper remake. Features like third-person camera, inertia and guardfly in the vein of Devil May Cry 4, a fully functional weapon wheel for improved weapon switching, reduced input lag and new gameplay modes like the Legendary Dark Knight and Must-Style modes are incredible additions that make the game feel and play more like the most recent entries in the series, turning the already excellent original into an even better game. You can check out some of these features in action in the launch trailer below.</p>

<p>The Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod will have to make do for the time being for fans of the series eagerly anticipating to learn what's next for the series. Though long-time series director Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">left CAPCOM last year</a>, the future of the franchise could still be bright, as series creator Hideki Kamiya is working with the Japanese publisher again, and has recently expressed the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-is-once-again-letting-capcom-and-everyone-else-know-that-he-would-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry/">remake the first entry in the series.</a></p>

			<p>Despite the silence surrounding Kingdom Hearts IV, Square Enix has confirmed it is still hard at work on it, but this is the end of the good news for fans of the series today.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new message</a> shared by the publisher today, it has been confirmed that the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing Link has been officially canceled. The publisher canceled the game as it was determined that it would be difficult to <em>"offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time."</em> At the end of the message, Square Enix confirmed that they are still hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, so hopefully it won't take long to see more of the next entry in the series, of which we have seen very little since its announcement.</p>
<p>The cancellation of Kingdom Hearts Missing Link seems to be part of a big 3-year reboot plan from Square Enix, which is being implemented to achieve consistent releases of major titles and more cooperation between the creative studios. The plan was outlined today in new <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20250514_01_en.pdf">documents</a> shared after the unveiling of the company's fiscal year report, and it includes the creation of an R&amp;D division for AI development tools, a multi-platform focus to improve profitability of games, placing all its games under the management of the same studio, reducing outsourcing, the cancellation of several titles and more. As it will take time to implement the plan, the publisher expects a large drop in net sales, but stable operating income for the current fiscal year ending in March 2026, so no major release should be expected.</p>
<p>Though it's likely at this point that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-improved-visuals-will-limit-the-number-of-disney-worlds-tetsuya-nomura-reveals/">Kingdom Hearts IV</a> is not going to launch before March 31st, 2026, Square Enix still has a few titles in the pipeline. The Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remakes are still scheduled for release this year, as is the Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port, which will unlikely offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-nintendo-switch-2-no-60-fps-mode-unreal-engine-5/">a 60 FPS mode</a> on the system, despite some recent hints. The publisher is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-partners-with-tbs-tv-to-create-an-original-ip-game/">working with TBS TV</a> to create a game based on an original intellectual property.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-working-on-a-new-project-codenamed-%E2%80%9Ctf%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-rumor.1188765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-new-project-tf/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve is working on a new project codenamed "Tf" according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by known Valve leaker Tyler McVicker, a new "Tf" codename was discovered in the latest Deadlock update, similar to how the HLX, rumored to be Half-Life 3, was discovered. This codenamed project isn't a leftover from Deadlock or any other project, as its inclusion in the Source 2 engine, which powers every game from Valve, means that there is a preset inside the engine with development tools that can be used by a team to make content for it. This is, according to the leaker, a standard procedure for every game developed in the Source 2 engine, as a differentiation of sorts is needed to indicate different projects and development tools.</p>
<p>As for what this new Valve project could be, no one can say. Though the codename seems to suggest some relation with Team Fortress, Tyler McVickers believes it is not a port of Team Fortress 2 to the Source 2 engine. Going by the timeline and the fact that the project is more recent than Deadlock and Counter-Strike 2, it's very possible that the project is currently in the same state as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghG8kZdtWoE">earliest Deadlock footage</a> available online, so it will take some time to learn more about it.</p>
<p><iframe title="VALVE NEWS &amp; DOOM THE DARK AGES DISCUSSION/GAMEPLAY" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDs0MSChMvc?start=1415&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the project codenamed "Tf" is likely not getting revealed anytime soon, there's a good chance that the Valve project codenamed HLX will be revealed and released this year. According to Tyler McVicker, this project, rumored to be<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"> Half-Life 3</a>, is being widely playtested ahead of a possible summer reveal and winter release. The game is reportedly also playable from beginning to end, so chances are high that, even if the game is not really Half-Life 3, the series will return after the successful VR game Half-Life Alyx.</p>

			<p>This morning, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with TBS TV to create a game based on an original intellectual property. TBS is one of five private broadcasters and is mostly known as the home of Ninja Warrior (known as Sasuke in Japan), a sports/reality show where a hundred participants compete in a four-stage obstacle course.</p>
<p>Here's the translated press release, which does not provide any details on the game itself (likely still in the concept phase):</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Co., Ltd. aims to continue to provide new experiences and value that will remain in the hearts and minds of customers around the world through its content and services, based on corporate philosophy of "Creating new worlds with limitless imagination. Under the new medium-term management plan, the Square Enix Group is working to deliver to customers a rich variety of content with solid appeal through the creation of new IP, the development of new business models, and the multifaceted development of IP.</em></p>
<p><em>TBS Television Inc. aims to be the starting point that moves society by delivering heart-stirring moments in a variety of fields. TBS' brand promise is to "create the world of tomorrow with the best of time. With this brand promise, we are taking on the challenge of pioneering digital content and growing into the global content brand "TBS". As part of these efforts, in July, we will launch our own game business brand "TBS GAMES" and focus on the creation of original IP originating from games. </em></p>
<p><em>Square Enix and TBS have decided to collaborate on the development of a completely new original IP game for both domestic and international markets, combining the experience and strengths they have cultivated in their respective fields. We hope you will look forward to the new original IP will be created by combining the knowledge of both companies in the entertainment field.</em></p>
<p>Considering the history of Square Enix, this could be a roleplaying game of some kind, but it's really too early to tell. However, we'll keep an eye on any news in the coming months.</p>
