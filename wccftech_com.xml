			<p>During the weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Live stream</a>, Mojang announced the upcoming 'Vibrant Visuals' update that will land soon for the Bedrock Edition of the best-selling game ever.</p>
<p>The developers described it as the studio's vision for what the game should look like when injected with modern graphics features, such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, dynamic shadows, water reflections, and more.</p>
<p>Improvements such as volumetric lighting mean players will see the sun's rays cut across the overworld, with each block casting its own shadow. Light will shine through windows, and you'll be able to see reflections not only in water but also on the surface of metal blocks, while subsurface scattering adds a soft glow to leaves and grass.&nbsp;Mobs and items will also have more glow - spider eyes will be even more menacing in the dark, and torches will cast a glowing path back to your build. This will be particularly striking while in the deep dark.</p>

<p>Mojang clarified that Vibrant Visuals is merely a cosmetic update to Minecraft. As such, it won't affect the gameplay mechanics in any way. This means that existing lighting mechanics, such as when enemy mobs are allowed to burn, crop growth, daylight detectors, mob farms, and more will continue to work exactly as before. This is important because it makes it so players in the same realm can all play together, whether they are using Vibrant Visuals or not. During Minecraft Live, Art Director Jasper Boerstra said:</p>
<p><em>Vibrant Visuals is backward compatible with Old Worlds, and it runs locally - so you can play with friends who don't have it enabled.</em></p>
<p>The developers are currently testing Vibrant Visuals on various devices compatible with Bedrock Edition. Soon, this version will be available via beta or preview for users to test. Mojang also said they will eventually port this graphics update to the Java Edition, too.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a powerful PC with GeForce RTX hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft With RTX</a> remains the best way to experience the game from a visual standpoint.</p>
