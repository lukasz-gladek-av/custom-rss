			<p>This past Friday afternoon, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">quietly announced</a> that it would be raising the price for its Xbox Series X/S consoles in the United States, with the Series X getting a $50 increase, the 2TB Series X getting a $70 increase, and the Series S getting a $20 increase starting October 3. It's the second price jump for the Xbox console line this year, meaning that when we finally get to Oct.3, in the US alone, the Series S will have gone up $100, the Series X $150, and the 2TB Series X variant will have jumped up $200 in price.</p>



<p>Many have been quick to point to the current US administration's new tariffs as the real reason behind these price jumps, or as Microsoft puts it, "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." According to former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, however, that's only part of the story.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ybarra plainly states, "<em>Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues</em>. <em>And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He further clarifies that he's pointing out that the tariffs only account for one price increase. This second jump in price "<em>is simply a different problem and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems</em>," while tariffs remain "<em>an excuse to continue raising prices</em>."</p>



<p>The tariffs introduced this year are undoubtedly part of the price increases on hardware from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox. But Ybarra isn't exactly wrong to point out that Microsoft raising its prices a second time, and the struggles it faces when competing with PlayStation and Nintendo go deeper and started well before this year's tariffs came into the equation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-a-large-interconnected-story-and-grounded-action-elements-%E2%80%93-rumor.1304412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious entries in years, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">demo</a> I tried during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month proved how the whole experience will be elevated by high-quality ray-traced lighting and layered sound design, which made every dark corridor haunting and every escape attempt tense, even in a noisy, expo environment. And if new rumors are to be believed, Resident Evil Requiem may also deliver the most complex narrative the series has seen.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, well-known leaker Dusk Golem went over the rumors currently circulating regarding the next entry in the series launching next year, revealing some additional, previously unknown details. As previously mentioned, Leon will be the second playable character in the game besides Grace, and the classic Resident Evil series protagonist will feature in the ninth entry in the series with an older appearance - unshaven and with greying hair. </p>



<p>Leon's gameplay segments, which are expected to be revealed during this week's Tokyo Game Show, will be action-oriented, but in a more grounded sort of way than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, doing away with enemies like possessed statues and more. Generally, the insider expects these action segments, which will take place in larger environments also featuring vehicles to move from one location to another, similar to the boat section in Resident Evil 4, to be compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II gameplay.</a></p>



<p>The most interesting thing Dusk Golem revealed about Resident Evil Requiem is how Grace's and Leon's campaigns will be set in different years. Most of Grace's campaign will be set in 2028, while Leon's in 2020, and both will form a large, cohesive and interconnected story. While the Resident Evil series has often featured different campaigns with different main characters interconnected on some levels, this would be the first time this element is brought to such a scale.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Dusk Golem proved to have access to insider information in the past, we still have to take everything revealed in the video above with a healthy grain of salt. Thankfully, it's very likely we won't have to wait much longer to see Leon's new appearance and gameplay. No matter when this reval will occur, we know for certain we won't have to wait until Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2026 to learn more about its more action-focused elements.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-metal-gear-solid-game-do-you-think-should-be-remade-next-konami-wants-to-know.1304379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new survey shared on <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979">X (formerly Twitter) by user Metal Gear Network</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">Insider-Gaming</a>) reveals that Konami wants to know which Metal Gear Solid game fans think should get the remake treatment next, now that we're beyond the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://questant.jp/q/7DNR3EOO">survey</a> is entirely in Japanese, so unless you can read it or have a translation tool handy, you'll probably struggle to answer the questions to be able to submit your choice. But the key takeaway here is that Konami is clearly trying to gauge what fans want to see next.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The choices presented in the survey are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>



<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</li>



<li>Other (with a box to type in your selection)</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that there is more MGS on the horizon, if only through the coming release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2</a>, which is said to include MGS4, MGS: Peace Walker, and MGSV. Those wouldn't be major remakes or touch-ups of the aforementioned titles, though; they'd be in line with the first volume of the Master Collection, which is, they'd just be a means of playing the series on modern hardware. Of course, there's a larger question around what this would mean for MGS4 due to it currently being marooned on PlayStation 3, but that's a whole different topic.</p>



<p> So far, the MGSD: Snake Eater remake has had a strong commercial start, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">selling over 1 million copies in its first day,</a> according to Konami. It's also had a strong critical start, with players and critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Wccftech included</a>) praising the remake for its efforts in updating what many consider to be one of the best stealth-action games out there.</p>



<p>From an external point of view, strong sales and critical reception should be exactly what Konami wanted out of the MGSD: Snake Eater remake, so why not move forward and pick another game in the series to repeat it with? Besides MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater was the riskiest game to remake, because it's the one that most of the series fans hold in higher regard than the rest.</p>



<p>Just like it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Konami got the most difficult one off the board first, and by all means, knocked it out of the park. There will be high expectations for whatever comes next, but at least we can have some confidence in what Konami is trying to do with the series.</p>



<p>So, which game would you pick to get the same treatment that MGS3 got next? Personally, I don't need any of them to get a remake, I'd just like to be able to play my beloved MGS4 without having to boot up my aging PS3.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-gameplay-details-concept-art-leak-xbox-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gameplay-details-and-concept-art-for-xbox%E2%80%99s-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-have-leaked.1304337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details regarding Xbox's cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have leaked online through a report on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">MP1st</a>, giving us a little more of an idea of what this game might have tried with its gameplay mechanics, the opportunity its developer The Initiative and Microsoft saw with it, and a few pieces of concept art.</p>



<p>When Microsoft announced that Perfect Dark was going to be the debut game for its new "<em>AAAA</em>" studio, The Initiative in <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-xbox-series-x-s-microsoft-game-awards-2020/">2020</a>, even if there was a sense that it was announced far too early, there was a buzz of excitement from fans. Jump ahead five years, and not only is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, but The Initiative is gone</a>, with the studio and its would-be debut game being one of the many major casualties from Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">massive 9,000+ layoff</a> this past July.</p>



<p>Before any of that happened, per MP1st's sources, Microsoft saw bringing back Perfect Dark as a chance to take advantage of the fact that two other major videogame secret agent-types were missing from the industry, namely 007 and Solid Snake. Of course, that's no longer the case, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> putting the MGS series firmly back in players' minds and IO Interactive working up to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">007 First Light</a> release, but back in 2020, both series had been absent from gaming for some time.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, the documentation mentions three concepts called the Relentless System, the Reward System, and the Adrenaline System, though only the last of those three were detailed in the documents.</p>



<p>The Adrenaline system would have let players slow down time to dodge incoming bullets, line up their own shots, and move faster than surrounding enemies. It would also have let Joanna Dark do more damage to enemies, heal more, and reduce damage taken.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A piece of concept art from the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot via a report from MP1st.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There's also mention of a vertical slice that would have consisted of "<em>Season 1</em>" for the game, which gives some weight to rumors that the game would have had an episodic-style release, though at this point, who can say if they would have definitively gone that route.</p>



<p>Overall, to say it's unfortunate that this game never came to pass is an understatement, especially since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/">almost saved after Microsoft dropped the ball</a>. Yes, Joanna Dark no longer would have had the open window previously granted due to the absence of MGS and 007, but I doubt that anyone would have minded having three great modern stealth-action games to play. </p>



<p>Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-studio-head-leaves-xbox-feels-pride-perfect-dark-remake/">last week</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, left Xbox, and said he "<em></em><em>couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em>"</p>
