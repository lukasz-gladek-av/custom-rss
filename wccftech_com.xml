			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, a digital fantasy tabletop adventure game set in the Forgotten Realms, will be released later this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and VR (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamVR</a>, Meta Horizon, PSVR2). The news came today from developer Resolution Games, which previously made Demeo. Compared to that game, though, the D&amp;D licensed game will feature more narrative.</p>
<p>Tommy Palm, founder and CEO of Resolution Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>While the world of Demeo is rich with lore, our previous titles focus primarily on tactical action over motivation and narrative. With DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, story is just as important as combat, so we’ve rebalanced our approach to make sure we can deliver more of it. With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the Demeo Action Roleplaying System.</em></p>
<p>To improve in this area, Resolution Games hired legendary story designer Matt Sernett as the project’s narrative lead. Sernett previously worked as a designer for the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS tabletop game and contributed to DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS video games such as the classics Baldur’s Gate, Baldur’s Gate II, and Icewind Dale. More recently, he contributed to the narrative of Bungie's Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Matt Sernett added:</p>
<p><em>When DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS launched the fifth edition back in 2014, the first adventure that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for Battlemarked players to begin their journey. The first adventure in Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of D&amp;D is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.</em></p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of another D&amp;D licensed game in development at Giant Skull, the new studio founded by former God of War and Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. That game will be a single player action/adventure title.</p>

			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two chief executives from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies, who worked on each Grand Theft Auto game since GTA III, have left the company just a week before the studio's first release, MindsEye, is set to launch.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Paul Bland quietly confirmed his departure with a quick update to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn page</a> that his time at Build A Rocket Boy concluded in June 2025, while chief legal officer Riley Graebner announced his departure with a short post on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn page</a>, saying "<em>After three and a half years my time at BARB has come to a close. I'm proud of what we've accomplished</em>."</p>
<p>That both of them have left just before MindsEye launches is more just the latest odd thing to be attached to MindsEye's story, than any actual reflection on what we should expect from the game on June 10.</p>
<p>But add that news to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-enthusiastic previews </a>the game got, how little we know about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">game so close to release</a>, reports of the <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1929323838656950698">studio not giving out review codes</a>, negative reviews on the studio's internal structure from former employees on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a>, and the studio's co-chief executive officer claiming that any negative attention the game is a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">someone financially investing in a campaign to tarnish the studio's name</a>, and it all strikes as a bit more than odd.</p>
<p>Of course, the game could still come out next week and be amazing, but these departures are leading players in the game's official Discord server and on social media to show concern for its launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye and Everywhere have always sounded like two incredibly ambitious projects. It would be far more exciting if both games were spectacular, than if they failed to hit their mark. It's far too early to make a call on it yet, if for no other reason than none of us have played it, but it'll be interesting to see what June 10 holds either way.</p>
