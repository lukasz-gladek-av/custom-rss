			<p>PS5 users might be treated to a full wave of Xbox games in 2025 as Microsoft continues its third-party push. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames is coming in Spring 2025, and DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PS5 at launch, but there's a lot more coming from Microsoft-owned studios.</p>
<p>Earlier today, insider Nate the Hate <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the latest rumors he heard from his industry sources. According to him, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo The Master Chief Collection will be released sometime this year for Sony's PlayStation 5 and even for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> having heard the same rumors about these games making the jump to other consoles. He also added a few more titles that are reportedly being prepared for a PS5 debut: Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and even Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The latter in particular would mark the arrival of one of the most iconic Xbox franchises on its main console rival. Sure, it's a very old game at this point (the Ultimate Edition remaster launched in 2015), but it could be a sign that more games in the franchise originally created by Epic and now handled by The Coalition could be ported. After all, there have been rumors of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-collection-rumored-to-be-coming-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War Collection</a> for years.</p>
<p>The announcement of the other two would definitely be easier to handle for Xbox fans. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great game in its own right</a> (albeit far too similar to the first installment), but it's also a niche title that could certainly use all the sales it can get. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology Retold</a> (which, however, still isn't available on Xbox consoles, either).</p>
<p>By the way, Corden even said these games could be released on the Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the PS5. Personally, I do have some doubts regarding Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, as that is a rather heavy game that might be really challenging to port onto a platform that is rumored to be quite a bit weaker than the Xbox Series S.</p>
