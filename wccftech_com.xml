			<p>It looks like Assassin's Creed Shadows might be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> in the not-too-distant future. The news comes directly from PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), the European rating regulator, which has <a href="https://pegi.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a version for Nintendo's upcoming console. Of course, it could be a mistake, especially since the listing only appears in the 'most searched' tab and not when you actually search for the game.</p>
<p>However, chances are it's not. We know that Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Nintendo platforms ever since the original Switch. So far, for the Switch 2, they have just announced Star Wars Outlaws, which will be released on September 4 with all the DLC, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, which launches next month on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>The main doubt surrounding the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 would be of a technical nature. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is very advanced from a technical standpoint</a>. The latest iteration of the Anvil engine features virtual geometry, ray-traced global illumination, dynamic weather, wind, seasons, and destructible environments. However, it is that announcement of Star Wars Outlaws that should give fans hope. While Massive's game runs on a different engine, their own Snowdrop, it is just as advanced as Assassin's Creed Shadows, if not more so in certain areas. On PC, it's even more taxing than the latest Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 could run both games decently, it would be proof that it can punch above its weight class, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-good-job-ps4-visuals-enhancements-40-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be</a> PlayStation 4-like with some enhancements here and there. Both of these games only run on the latest consoles by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Assassin's Creed Shadows, the lineup of the upcoming console would get even richer. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the second most successful launch after Valhalla, which launched during COVID, and critic reviews also rewarded Ubisoft Quebec's title accordingly. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 8.7/10 by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
