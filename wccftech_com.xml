			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Self—</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>
