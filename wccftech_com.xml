			<p>Today, Serbian game development studio GFA Games announced that PIONER, their post-apocalyptic MMO first-person shooter, will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> on Tuesday, December 16.</p>



<p>The announcement comes at the same time as the game has officially surpassed 500,000 wishlists. No details have been revealed yet on pricing, but we do know that there will be a Standard Edition and a Deluxe Edition. The latter will be more expensive, but it will grant access to the following in-game items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” - a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX - a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12, AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title - a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency - 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” - cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch - inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>

<p>The game, initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-is-an-impressive-survival-mmofps-inspired-by-stalker-and-metro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in 2021, was featured here on Wccftech multiple times thanks to two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interviews with GFA Games</a>. We've often referred to it as clearly inspired by STALKER; it takes place on a vast post-apocalyptic island (spanning over 50 square kilometers filled with hidden dungeons, story quests and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards) where the remnants of the Soviet era have created an incredible alternate reality. As a social MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Here's an overview of what players can expect in this title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Story-driven campaign</li>



<li>Intense PvP modes</li>



<li>Unique Progression System that lets players grow their influence by completing quests, defeating monsters and exploring. The greater their influence, the more inclined merchants will be to sell you better items and the higher the quality of materials that will drop. Even non-combat abilities can be improved.</li>



<li>Diverse game activities include events, story-driven locations, and engaging mini-games such as fishing and Carnage, a unique tactical card mini-game featuring collectible decks, rewards, and ranked matches.</li>



<li>An extensive weapon customization system lets players tweak militarized weapons with a wide array of unique modules and designs.</li>



<li>Realistic survival mechanics require the maintenance of your character's strength by managing hunger, rest and resources.</li>



<li>In-depth crafting system: use artefacts, anomaly energy, and scavenged materials to craft powerful weapons and equipment at workbenches.</li>
</ul>

			<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>
