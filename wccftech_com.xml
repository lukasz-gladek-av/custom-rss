			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/03/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-1/">announced the first batch</a> of <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>games joining the service for <strong>February 2026,</strong> headlined by a couple of major past releases and one new day-one launch for the subscription service. <a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">That new release is <strong>Squanch Games'</strong> upcoming <strong>High on Life 2</strong></a>, while the other headlining titles include <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>.</p>



<p>This new batch of games also includes a couple of titles already included in the service for players subscribed to the <strong>Game Pass Ultimate </strong>tier that are now available for <strong>Premium</strong> tier members. Once again, unfortunately for <strong>Essential</strong> tier players, there's nothing in this batch of games that increases the library of titles available to players on the bottom-tier subscription.</p>



<p>Outside of High on Life 2, the other two new releases entering the service this month are <strong>Roadside Research</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anime-inspired-life-sim-starsand-island-debuts-next-week-early-access/">Starsand Island</a></strong>. The former is a gas station management game where you play as aliens gathering information on humans while they fuel up their cars. The latter is a new life/farming sim, and both are arriving in the service as 'Game Preview' titles.</p>



<p>Other notable titles include <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong>, which replaces <strong>Madden NFL 24</strong>, as the 2024 entry is the only game leaving the service in this update, and <strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong>. It's also worth noting that, while <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> has yet to confirm a major current-gen update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/">after a <strong>PlayStation Store</strong> listing let the cat out of the bag</a>, it seems like its arrival date in Game Pass, February 13, 2026, will likely be the day the new version is released.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Game Pass in this initial February 2026 batch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy II - February 3 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - February 3 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>

			<p>Since moving on from the Gamebryo engine, which powered <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"><strong>faithful remake</strong></a> (which <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/around-half-of-oblivion-remastered-players-on-ps5-played-for-less-than-15-hours-nostalgia-is-powerful-but-only-so-much/">proved successful even without having great player retention</a></strong>) and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em>, Bethesda used its <strong>Creation Engine</strong> for all its games, including <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/"><strong>Fallout 4</strong></a></em>. </p>



<p>Despite powering what is widely considered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best role-playing games of all time</strong>, the engine caught some flak from gamers for how it manages the sprawling worlds of the games it powers, forcing <strong>dated, immersion-breaking loading screens</strong>, as seen in <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong>Starfield</strong></a></em>.</p>



<p>For this reason, many wish Bethesda would <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">leave this engine behind</strong> in favor of a more modern solution for future games like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls 6</strong></a></em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 5</strong></a></em>, but it's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unlikely this will ever happen</strong>, as it would create quite a few <strong>critical issues</strong> for the studio.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Press Box PR</strong></a>, Skyrim's design lead, Bruce Nesmith, discussed the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">biggest misconceptions fans have about the Creation Engine</strong> and its limitations, as well as what an engine change would entail.</p>



<p><em>"What you have to realize is that if you were to switch engines, and I'll say this for any game anywhere, is that it is a massive effort. You are talking about dozens of people spent doing nothing but making an engine work,"</em> the developer said.</p>



<p><em>"You are talking about putting your developers into a situation where they can't play the game. They may not even be able to work on making the game for long stretches because the engine is not there or up to snuff yet," </em>Nesmith added, highlighting how <strong>this was an issue the studio had with </strong><em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong></em>, where the Creation Engine had to be changed <em>"dramatically"</em> to do multiplayer.</p>



<p>An engine change would also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">not be beneficial</strong> due to the fact that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Creation Engine has been worked on for so long</strong> that it has been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tweaked</strong> to serve Bethesda's purposes. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"At this point, it's probably a wiser bet to keep working with it. The benefits that you get from switching to Unreal Engine are probably not going to materialize until two titles down the road,"</em> the Skyrim design lead said, highlighting how a game like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls 6</em> wouldn't suddenly become <strong>a different game</strong> than its predecessors with a sudden engine switch.</p>



<p>While the Creation Engine has been used since <em>Skyrim</em>, <strong>that doesn't mean it hasn't changed since</strong>. "<em>Every Bethesda game that has ever released has had major improvements made to the creation engine. Significant improvements are always being made to it. There's an entire team that's devoted to nothing but doing that,"</em> Bruce Nesmith said. <em>"But the advantage you have there is that you can still run the game during the whole time because you have an existing engine. You're not having to figure out how to put this new thing in place."</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, for these reasons, the Skyrim design lead <em>"would fall on the side of keeping the Creation Engine."</em> As the engine has been tweaked and iterated upon already, and even significantly, as the studio did for Fallout 76, Nesmith believes that <strong>anything that can be done in Unreal Engine and not in the Creation Engine can be easily put into Bethesda's engine</strong>, delivering new features without causing the additional issues a full engine switch would bring.</p>



<p>Looking at how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Starfield</em>'s vision clashed with its engine limitations, there's no denying that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Creation Engine definitely needs to be improved</strong> to handle big open worlds seamlessly. As <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> has been in development for a very long time, it wouldn't be surprising to see the sixth entry in the series be the first game from Bethesda to handle a massive open-world properly without loading screens. Would it be enough to make it win the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/"><strong><em>"game of expectations"</em> that <em>Starfield</em> lost</strong></a>? By itself, probably not, but it would definitely help the game and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">its perception</strong></a> a lot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“That Sucks. What Are We Learning?”: New Report Reveals How Obsidian Looks to Bounce-Back After Two Commercial Misses in 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Obsidian Entertainment</strong> was one of the busiest studios in 2025, releasing not just one, but <strong>three major titles</strong> last year. It began the year with <strong>Avowed</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">February 2025</a>, followed by <strong>Grounded 2</strong> releasing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">early access in July 2025</a>, and capped off the year with <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">October 2025</a>. Two of those three games were misfires in terms of sales (though they were fairly well received by critics, especially here on Wccftech), and a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy">Bloomberg</a> digs into how the studio is looking to bounce back and "<em>reinvent itself</em>."</p>



<p>If you can't guess which of the two games missed the mark on their sales, it was The Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, though Obsidian Entertainment studio head <strong>Feargus Urquhart</strong> is quick to note that they weren't complete bombs. "<em>They're not disasters. I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>It was more like: <strong>'That sucks. What are we learning?</strong>'"</em></p>



<p>One of those takeaways is how long the studio takes on its projects. Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 both took over half a decade to make, and Urquhart (and the rest of the studio, seemingly) wants to cut that time down by half, within reason. When Avowed was initially pitched to Microsoft, it was initially envisioned as a massive, ambitious cross between <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> and <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. As the studio's design director, <strong>Josh Sawyer</strong> put it: "<em>I don't think there's a team on the planet that could execute on this</em>." </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what Avowed ended up becoming, but by the time the decision was made to do away with the multiplayer portion and assign a new director to the game, it had been in development for <strong>three years</strong>. It took a total of <strong>seven years</strong> to actually get what we know Avowed to be out the door.</p>



<p>Regarding the time spent developing The Outer Worlds 2, which took <strong>six years</strong> between the release of the first game to the release of its sequel, game director <strong>Brandon Adler</strong> said, "<em>I don't think anybody really likes five, six, seven-year dev cycles. We've kind of grown into that</em>."</p>



<p>As for why Grounded 2 was able to come together faster than Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, that came partially from <strong>Eidos Montreal</strong> pitching itself as a support studio for Obsidian. With the help of Eidos, and the distance afforded by not developing the entire thing internally, Obsidian co-founder and one of the game's managing directors, <strong>Chris Parker</strong>, noted that it gave them the grace to make faster decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>I was like, 'If this was one of our internal teams, we would work on this for another two or three months</em>,'" when discussing the decision to abandon making the rideable bugs in Grounded 2 shared by two or more players at once. "<em>We made this call because we could tell them what to do. It feels like we still run around with our kid gloves on internally</em>."</p>



<p>Probably the most damning quote in the report, in terms of how the studio needed to take a hard look at its processes and work towards change, comes from Sawyer. Regarding the fact that Obsidian released three games last year, he said, "<em>Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out. It's not good to release three games in the same year. <strong>It's a result of things going wrong</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Leaning on support studios seems to be one tactic the studio may use to make faster decisions, but a more reliable tactic will be reusing technology and systems where possible, instead of having to start from scratch all the time. "<em>We don't need to change everything every time</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>We've had this debate internally: Do people really care that we spent an extra hundred person-months on the inventory screen?</em>"</p>



<p>At the same time, Urquhart also noted that when doing a post-mortem on Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, it can be minor differences that make a huge impact on a game's success. The trouble is figuring out which way those minor details are meant to go. "<em>Our job, all of us here, is to make games that people want to play and buy, and if we continue to do that, then we have a solid business</em>."</p>



<p>Cutting down development times with <strong>more outsourcing</strong> and <strong>reusing technology</strong> where possible are two of the key elements in Obsidian Entertainment's plan for the future. Also included in those plans are the growth of up-and-coming developers, with Urquhart mentoring <strong>Justin Birtch</strong> and <strong>Marcus Morgan</strong> to take his place one day at the studio's helm, and having <strong>multiple, smaller-scale projects on the go at once</strong>, instead of one big project that consumes the entire workforce. </p>



<p>"<em>You need to keep having at-bats, because at some point, if you can consistently make good stuff, you'll get those breakout hits</em>," said Morgan. </p>



<p>As for Obsidian Entertainment's next "<em>at-bats</em>," the report corroborates what we've previously heard, that the studio is not working on<strong> </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/"><strong>The Outer Worlds 3</strong>, but is instead focused on new games in the <strong>Avowed universe</strong> as its next major project</a>. Alongside that, it'll be working on new content for Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2, and whatever it is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-creator-returns-work-full-time-at-obsidian-entertainment/"><strong>Fallout</strong> creator <strong>Tim Cain</strong> recently returned to Obsidian full-time to work on</a>. </p>
