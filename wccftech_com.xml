			<p><strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, series producer on <strong>The Division</strong> at <strong>Ubisoft</strong> and <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong>, has left the French company to join <strong>EA </strong>and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, Massive <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">announced this morning</a>. Despite the fact that Gerighty's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">return to The Division and his appointment as the series lead were supposed to be votes of confidence in Ubisoft's favour for <strong>The Division 3</strong></a>, now that he's leaving, Ubisoft doesn't want The Division players to be concerned.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">short post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Ubisoft Massive account, which says of Gerighty, "<em>Once an Agent, always an Agent.</em>" </p>



<p>"<em>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the Tom Clancy's The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios</em>," the statement reads. "<em>While we'll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>After thanking Gerighty, the post continues by addressing players, saying, "<em><strong>For our players, don't worry, Agents.</strong> Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For Gerighty's part, on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, he wrote, "<em>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division and Godspeed!</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Agents! <br>Quick update from the Base Of Operations:<br>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure.</p><p>The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on.</p><p>Long live The Division…</p></div>— Julian Gerighty (@jgerighty) <a href="https://twitter.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The messages from Massive and from Gerighty are meant to try and calm any concerns players might have about his departure, but it's doubtful they've succeeded. Several of the comments under Massive's announcement are players sharing concerns for the future of The Division franchise and, most importantly, The Division 3, and you can't exactly blame them.</p>



<p>Not only does this news come days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Ubisoft laid off 55 developers</strong> from Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, but it also arrives at a time when, for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">all the recent talk about The Division 3 (talk that was coming from Gerighty)</a>, we've still not seen anything from the game as we come up on three years since its official announcement.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2 will be seven years old</a> this coming <strong>March 12, 2026</strong>, and players have wanted nothing more than a proper sequel for at least the last four years, and outside of The Division, Ubisoft doesn't exactly seem to be in a particularly strong place.</p>



<p>The company is currently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">a battle with the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> after suddenly shuttering the <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> studio, three weeks after the majority of the branch voted to unionize</a>. It also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">recently laid off staff at its <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong> team</a>, and the company is still seemingly in the midst of a restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">following the establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Gerighty's departure is also the second time in the span of a year that the series lead for one of the company's major franchises left shortly after layoff announcements, the first having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté</strong>, leaving amidst layoffs and restructuring due to Vantage Studios being established</a>. A departure that was also marked by Ubisoft seemingly trying to spin it as Côté choosing to leave, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">when in actuality, Ubisoft asked him to "<em>step aside</em>."</a> </p>



<p>When you look at the broader picture of the current state of Ubisoft, if you're a fan of The Division, it's pretty impossible for you not to be concerned about where the franchise will go from here. Yes, Gerighty is just one person, and it's not as if his sole contributions to the franchise were what made it the third-person shooter you love, but you have to wonder what it says about the state of a company when it has lost yet another veteran developer in a lead role on one of its major franchises.</p>

			<p>This week, the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> is giving away two games in the same franchise: <strong>Styx</strong>. Both the first entry, 2014's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-master-of-shadows-4d9ab3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Shadows</a>, and the more recent installment, 2017's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-shards-of-darkness-77c030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shards of Darkness</a>, can be permanently added to your library on PC, provided that you do so before Thursday, January 22, at 5 PM. Shards of Darkness is actually being gifted with the Deluxe Edition, too.</p>



<p>Obviously, it's a way for publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> to increase exposure to the stealth game series in advance of the new game, <strong>Blades of Greed</strong>, which will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. You can now play the two entries of the sneaky goblin's adventures before checking out the limited-time demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released on Steam earlier this week</a>. The Styx games aren't masterpieces, but they're still pretty fun, and it's not like there's a ton of new stealth games on the market anyway.</p>



<p>The upcoming Blades of Greed will offer even more options for approaching stealthy missions. In Wccftech's hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</em></p>



<p><em>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for our full review of Blades of Greed.</p>
