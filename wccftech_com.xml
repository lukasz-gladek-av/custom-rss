			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> on Monday, Warhorse Studios held their first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream yesterday afternoon. The broadcast lasted over two hours and can now be replayed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2294365343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> (although there are also captures available on YouTube). It featured Warhorse Global PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling and Art Director Viktor Höschl playing the game and discussing its features at length.</p>
<p>The duo talked about optimization, revealing that people will be surprised by the PC optimization. The PR Manager also said his personal PC powered by a GeForce RTX 3050 could run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 'buttery smooth.' Moreover, he confirmed that the game won't include the Denuvo DRM on PC.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling:</strong> We are deep into optimizations and bug fixing. I'm extremely positive about the performance of the game and also about the state of the game if you're bothered by bugs. We will tell you the PC specs very soon. We are finishing it up. Right now, I can't tell you yet, but as you can see, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 runs, I think, at 80 FPS right now. I'm playing on a decent PC, of course. It's maybe even 90, so that is pretty good. I wouldn't be too worried.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Viktor Höschl:</strong> I think people will be really surprised by what kind of PC can run it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </strong>Yes, absolutely, so don't worry about that. We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, the other thing is, and give me a second of your attention here, DRM. There's things floating here in the chat; there's things floating out in the Internet, and many of those things are absolutely fake news. You should be very careful with the stuff you trust and see. I can tell you right now the exact situation, and the exact situation is that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not have Denuvo in there or any DRM system at all. We never confirmed it. There were some discussions, of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day, there won't be any Denuvo at all.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 11, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Officially Confirmed to Be Backward Compatible]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the latest <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1853976778366443775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games. There have been rumors about this feature for a long time, and even the president of Nintendo America <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-possibly-hinted-at-by-nintendo-of-america-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at it around a year ago. However, getting it confirmed definitively is sure to make prospective fans happy.</p>
<p>Furukawa stated:</p>
<p><em>In addition to being able to play Nintendo Switch software they currently own, consumers will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>More information on Nintendo Switch 2 backward compatibility is expected to be shared at a later date. The Japanese corporation still plans to announce the new console within the current fiscal year (that is to say, by March 2025).</p>
<p>Nintendo's financial results <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> yesterday weren't great. The company had to lower its sales forecast for the full year. However, in his briefing, Furukawa maintained that the Switch was still selling robustly compared to previous Nintendo platforms in their eighth year.</p>
<p>He then provided an analysis of why the Switch performed so well, attributing the platform's outstanding overall results not only to the great games but also to four key structural changes: merging the handheld and home console platforms into a single one; an emphasis on consumer touchpoints; reinforcing relationships with game developers; and regional expansion to growing markets.</p>
<p>The first point is arguably the most important one. On this subject, Furukawa-san explained:</p>
<p><em>Before Nintendo Switch, we offered two types of dedicated video game platforms: home consoles and handheld systems, each with its own unique set of titles. By merging these two platforms, Nintendo Switch became a unified platform where popular series from both home consoles and handheld systems come together in one place.</em></p>
<p><em>The merging of the two platforms allowed us to integrate our software development teams. By focusing our research and development on a single platform, we have achieved a more continuous stream of new titles without major gaps. With Nintendo Switch, we introduced the concept of a portable home console, which has been well-received by our consumers worldwide. Consumers now purchase Nintendo Switch for many reasons. Not only do we see first-time users, but we also see consumers purchase additional hardware to add to their collection or replace their hardware with newer ones. At the same time, ownership patterns have shifted from “one per family” to “one per person.” Although Nintendo Switch debuted as a home console, its sales also exhibit the characteristics of a handheld system.</em></p>
<p>That's why the Nintendo Switch 2 is also going to be a hybrid console. Whereas the Japanese corporation previously employed gimmicks that only lasted a generation (the Wiimote and the Wii U Gamepad, for instance), this shift to a handheld/home console combination will pay off dividends for multiple generations, given the consumer trend of playing on the go. After much experimentation, it looks like Nintendo has found a clear path forward.</p>

			<p>Posted by <a href="https://x.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1853933258112712918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853933258112712918%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user Stiven_SRB on X</a>, it's alleged that there is a Warcraft II Remaster in the works. Normally, it would be advised to take these sorts of posts with a huge pinch of salt, but due to the fact that Stiven frequently datamines Blizzard Games as a hobby, with people who are fans of the Blizzard Games seeming to rely heavily on the information released by him. It's also been leaked as of late that there are some huge updates coming for Warcraft III: Reforged, a game that has been quite controversial in the Warcraft community due to how it was handled and seemingly forgotten about. However, the Warcraft universe's 30th anniversary is fast approaching, with a special presentation taking place on <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">November 13</a>. This is where people will hear about content coming from World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble, as listed on the Blizzard Entertainment website. However, they have said there are plenty of surprises in store, so it's possible that this includes news to do with either Warcraft III or Warcraft II.</p>
<p>While the post from Stiven didn't offer much, he posted it with four pictures, which are supposed to be the key art of the game, including the logo for Warcraft II Remastered. If this is true, it seems that they will be learning from the mistakes that were made with Warcraft III: Reforged, as that game was meant to be a complete reimagining of the classic game. Warcraft III: Reforged wasn't all bad, and the gameplay improved, but for the most part, people didn't like the graphics of the new game.</p>
<p>If the news of a Warcraft II Remaster is true, it'll be interesting to see how they tackle the graphics and whether they will keep the graphics true to the original, which was originally released in 1995. The game went on to have some expansion backs, which led to a compilation of the game with the expansions named Warcraft II: The Dark Saga. However, it wasn't long ago that they added Warcraft II to Battle.net, allowing people to purchase it in the Battle.net shop. It's also available through GOG for those who want the classic experience. Because they've now made the original accessible, it seems a little bit more uncertain about how they will tackle a remaster of Warcraft II, or whether it's even in progress at Blizzard Entertainment in the first place.</p>
