<p><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> arrived on the shooter scene right at the end of 2024, and it arrived with such a bang, it made it seem like all Blizzard actually needed to do with Overwatch was make all the characters Marvel heroes. The third-person shooter expanded on the momentum built by its massive launch and has definitively wedged itself into the shooter genre and earned a spot among the other live-service free-to-play shooters.</p>



<p>As NetEase is charging up to make Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">"<em>the biggest game possible</em>,"</a> here's everything we know about the MOBA shooter stuffed with Marvel characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals initially arrived on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on December 6, 2024. On September 12, 2025, a version of the game was released for PlayStation 4. It has always been a free-to-play title with in-game microtransactions for cosmetic items and battle passes.</p>



<p>Premium transactions in Marvel Rivals are made with Lattice, which is one of several in-game currencies players can collect in the game, and the only one that can be purchased with real-world money. Untis, Chrono Tokens, Costume Coins, Unstable Molecules, and limited-time event-based currencies make up the rest of the in-game currencies you can collect.</p>



<p>Lattice, however, is the currency that you need to concern yourself with since it is the one used to buy battle passes and the only one you can buy with real-world money.</p>



<p>The price of Lattice, like other premium currencies in free-to-play games, can fluctuate with sales and sometimes price increases, but the current cost for the different amounts you can purchase is:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 Lattice = $0.99 USD</li>



<li>500 Lattice = $4.99 USD</li>



<li>1000 Lattice = $9.99 USD</li>



<li>2180 Lattice = $19.99 USD</li>



<li>5680 Lattice = $49.99 USD</li>



<li>11,680 Lattice = $99.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the battle pass is 990 Lattice, making the battle pass just under $10 USD and leaving you with only 10 Lattice if you purchase the 1000 Lattice option. Just enough to get the battle pass, but nowhere near what you'd need to get something else. </p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a third-person, free-to-play hero-shooter set within the Marvel universe, featuring Marvel characters from every corner of the comic books, though unsurprisingly leading with some of the most popular ones in today's age due to the popularity of the numerous Marvel movies that have been made in the past two decades.</p>



<p>The story, as you might have been able to guess considering the game includes Marvel characters from across space and time, is a <strong>multiverse-based</strong> story, which begins with two versions of <strong>Doctor Doom</strong>, one from the future and one from the present. Both Doom's separately worked on combining magic and science in order to gain control of the multiverse, and when the present-day Doom tries to execute his work, he ends up running into future Doctor Doom from 2099.</p>



<p>The fight that ensues between them causes chaos and leaves the multiverse in a fragile state, threatening to destroy everything until <strong>Galacta</strong>, the daughter of Galactus, contains the problem within a few mixed-up and muddied timelines. With several Marvel heroes and villains now seemingly stuck in the middle of both Doom's fighting, they all take sides as they agree or disagree on how to move forward. Meanwhile, Galacta keeps the whole thing contained as she gets a steady diet of <strong>Chronovium</strong>, her food of choice, rather than trying to eat planets like her father.</p>



<p>That is essentially the setup for why these characters, whether allies in the comics or not, are all fighting together in this seemingly never-ending bout. Each season adds new elements to the story with new playable characters introduced, and while it feels like a premise that is stretched thin to make the gameplay work, it's realistically not the craziest foundation for a story in Marvel history.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-season-of-marvel-rivals-so-far">Every Season of Marvel Rivals so far</h2>



<p>This section will be continuously updated with the release of new seasons in Marvel Rivals, so the following list is only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season 0: Dooms' Rise</strong> - December 6, 2024-January 10, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 1: Eternal Night Falls</strong> - January 10, 2025-April 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 2: Hellfire Gala - </strong>April 11, 2025-July 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 3: The Abyss Awakens</strong> - July 11, 2025-September 12, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 4: Heart of the Dragon </strong>- September 12, 2025-November 13, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 5: Love is a Battlefield </strong>- November 13, 2025-January 16, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Season 6: Night at the Museum</strong> - January 16, 2026-March 20, 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>When Marvel Rivals first launched, its Season 0 lasted five weeks, with Seasons 1 and 2 then lasting three months. After those initial three seasons, NetEase Games established a new seasonal structure, with every season lasting two months, with a major update in the middle of each, dividing seasons into halves. Each half of a season adds a new character and a map to the roster, while the battle pass for each season runs for the entire two months.</p>



<p>New cosmetics, game modes, limited-time modes, and balance changes vary from season to season with how they are introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is, at its core, a third-person shooter. Players are divided into two teams, with six players on each side. You can choose between a Quick Match or a Competitive Match to begin, with Quick Match including four game modes and Competitive featuring three.</p>



<p>Quick Match includes Domination, Convoy, Convergence, and Resource Rumble, while Competitive features Domination, Convoy, and Convergence. There's also Arcade Modes, which include Conquest, Doom Match, Conquest (Annihilation), Free Fight, Clone Rumble, and Giant-Size Brain Blast. There's also a Practice mode where you can practice against computer-controlled enemies. </p>



<p>Beyond the various game modes, which change up the rules of engagement, the other layers of gameplay come from the heroes you can choose to play as. Heroes are categorized as Duelists, Vanguards, and Strategists. Vanguards are the frontline heroes that you want charging into the fight, while Duelists are your more specialized characters that can take down enemies quickly and deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<p>Strategists are your support heroes, who help round out the full team to ensure you're approaching each game mode with a winning mixture.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-roster">Hero Roster</h2>



<p>The following list is the current roster of heroes, and with new heroes getting added with each season, this list will only ever be as accurate as possible at the time of publishing. Just like the Seasons list, we'll update this list as new heroes are added.</p>



<ul>
<li>Adam Warlock - Strategist</li>



<li>Angela - Vanguard</li>



<li>Black Panther - Duelist</li>



<li>Black Widow - Duelist</li>



<li>Blade - Duelist</li>



<li>Bruce Banner - Vanguard</li>



<li>Captain America - Vanguard</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger - Strategist</li>



<li>Daredevil - Duelist</li>

<li>Doctor Strange - Vanguard</li>



<li>Emma Frost - Vanguard</li>



<li>Gambit - Strategist</li>



<li>Groot - Vanguard</li>



<li>Hawkeye - Duelist</li>



<li>Hela - Duelist</li>



<li>Human Torch - Duelist</li>

<li>Thor - Vanguard</li>



<li>Ultron - Strategist</li>



<li>Venom - Vanguard</li>



<li>Winter Soldier - Duelist</li>



<li>Wolverine - Duelist</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play shooter with a heavily stylized visual style, Marvel Rivals isn't the kind of game that wants to push your hardware to its limit. It doesn't take too much to run, and if you have the hardware for it, you'll be able to push it as far as possible to maximize your framerate, a key factor for any competitive player.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NetEase Games</strong> is getting set to launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-joins-roster-season-6-the-game-awards-2025/">Season 6: Night at the Museum</a></strong> of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/marvel-rivals-everything-we-know-about-neteases-super-hero-charged-shooter/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong> this coming <strong>Friday, January 16, 2026</strong>, which includes the introduction of the game's latest duelist, everyone's favourite merc with a mouth, <strong>Deadpool</strong>.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">Season 5 introduced Rogue and Gambit</a>, Season 6 will start with Deadpool, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow at the halfway point. As NetEase does with every new season, ahead of its launch, the studio has debuted a gameplay trailer showing off the new hero's skills, with today's trailer showcasing Deadpool's lethal arsenal and the various ways in which players can take advantage of his skills.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Deadpool: The Merc with a Mouth | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a Duelist, Deadpool is actually a triple-threat hero. He's a Duelist, a Strategist, and a Vanguard. You can also unlock upgrades for his skills mid-game to make him even more deadly. With all of that built into one character, it's not surprising that in Quick mode games and Competitive mode games, there can only be one Deadpool on either side.</p>



<p>Along with Deadpool entering as the new character for the first half of Season 6, NetEase is introducing a significant update to the Hero Proficiency system. "<em>The cap will be raised for each hero and new rewards added such as Units, Unstable Molecules, Nameplates, Titles, Nameplate Frames, Badges, Dynamic Avatars, and more</em>," writes NetEase in a press release. </p>



<p>Season 6 also introduces a photo mode to Times Square, and Times Square will also be getting a new area called the Clobberin' Club, where you can challenge other players to duels. Then, on January 29, the Museum of Contemplation map will be introduced.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And as always, there are plenty of bug fixes and balance changes that are coming with the new season, though those will be <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">revealed in the full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>This is the season that is kicking off 2026 for NetEase Games and Marvel Rivals, and if NetEase is to be believed, 2026 will be the year that the studio really shows how much it can grow its third-person hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">after calling 2025 a "<em>warm-up</em>."</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Is CODE VEIN II a Numbered Sequel in a Different World? Bandai Namco Explains Time Travel and the Rebuilt Partner System]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/</link>
            <guid>1405123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>More than six years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the release of the first game</a>, <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> returns with <strong>CODE VEIN II</strong>, the sequel to the Soulslike action RPG that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-shipped-over-3-million-copies-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over three million copies</a></strong> across all platforms. While not a smashing success, the game undoubtedly garnered a sizable following. However, the developers are still making changes to several aspects in this new iteration; for instance, it is set in a completely different world with new characters. The first CODE VEIN also allowed co-op multiplayer, whereas this new entry focuses on expanding the Partner System that powers AI companions.</p>



<p>Following a recent press event <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where we went hands-on with the game</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled <strong>January 30</strong> launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, we sent a few questions to Bandai Namco Studios to uncover more details about CODE VEIN II. The answers were provided by CODE VEIN II producer <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong>-san and game director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>-san. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-character-creator-demo-release-date-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Character Creator demo will be released on January 23</a>, one week before the full game's debut.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>What were some of the challenges your team faced when it came to overhauling the combat and giving it more impact in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> In the previous game, players opted to play without a partner to focus solely on combat. To give players the option to explore alongside a partner while focusing on enemy encounters, <strong>we’ve introduced a new “Assimilation” mechanic to the partner system in this installment</strong>.</p>



<p>We rebuilt the partner system from scratch to ensure players can choose between the traditional “Summoning” mechanic and the newly added “Assimilation” mechanic, while also incorporating cooperative elements such as the Restorative Offering mechanic.</p>



<p><strong>If Code Vein II is in a separate universe with no connections to the first title, why go with a numbered sequel rather than calling it something different?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura: </strong>This second installment in the series continues the core concept of CODE VEIN: challenging, exploration-focused action alongside a partner character. By introducing time travel and the idea of intervening in a character's past, we felt that we could powerfully depict the drama of two species—humans and Revenants—living in different timelines.</p>



<p><strong>However, we also considered that if players experience returning to the past and altering it, and then ultimately encounter the continuation point of the previous game, they might feel the urge to intervene in that world as well. We felt that if we allowed this, it would negate the lives of the characters from the previous game, and the stories players experienced themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Considering these points, we ultimately decided to create a new story in a world distinct from the previous one. For these reasons, while this is the second installment in the series, it depicts a story set in a different world.</p>



<p><strong>What was the design philosophy your team had in mind when it came to creating the levels and encounters in CODE VEIN II? Is this intended to be more difficult than the original title?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> We've taken care to prevent unreasonable melee encounters from occurring, allowing players to stay focused on combat. Even when group battles do occur, this game features an enemy group-behavior control system that maintains a satisfying level of challenge while letting players enjoy the back-and-forth combat against enemies.</p>



<p><strong>How much player agency will there be when it comes to the time travel? Can players choose not to change events in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura:</strong> Travel between the present and past worlds is relatively unrestricted. Even while progressing the story in the past, you can return to the present world and explore it. <strong>As the story advances, you will encounter several major turning points where you must choose whether to return to the past.</strong> At these points, it is possible to advance the story without intervening in the past more than necessary.</p>



<p><strong>How many routes/endings will there be in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> While we can’t share specific numbers, we can say that <strong>the game includes multiple scenario branches and endings</strong> that reflect the choices and changes players make throughout their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
