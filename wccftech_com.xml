			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> will be laying off <strong>55 people</strong> at its <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> studios, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> has revealed. It's the second cost-cutting move from the company this month, after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shut down its Halifax-based studio, which saw <strong>71 people</strong> left without a job</a>.</p>



<p>According to the report, the news was delivered to staff through an internal email that cited the move had nothing to do with the developer's performance at either studio, and had all to do with Ubisoft believing the cuts to be necessary after a "<em>mapping of the future roadmap</em>" for the company.</p>



<p>The email added that the "<em>long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged</em>," as Massive continues to work on several <strong>The Division</strong> projects, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">The Division 3</a>, </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/"><strong>The Division 2: Survivors</strong> and <strong>The Division: Resurgence</strong></a>. There's also a potential fourth project (besides more The Division 2 expansions) with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-definitive-edition-seemingly-leaks-ubisoft/">The Division: Definitive Edition</a></strong>, though it's not yet clear what exactly that project will look like.</p>



<p>These cuts are also hitting Massive and Stockholm despite the fact that the email also reportedly states the studios are working on an "<em>unannounced innovative tech project</em>" that will "<em>play a central role in the development</em>" of the Snowdrop Engine, the game engine built by Massive Entertainment that's been used for recent titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-demo-this-year/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Ubisoft kicked off 2025 by laying off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/"><strong>185 people</strong> and shutting down its Leamington-based studio</a>. It then followed that up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">cuts at Massive Entertainment</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx Studio</a>. It's beginning 2026 in a similar fashion, with <strong>126 people already cut just 13 days into 2026.</strong> Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">recently closed a deal with <strong>Tencent</strong> to establish a new venture, <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>,</a> which will now house the company's biggest IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>
