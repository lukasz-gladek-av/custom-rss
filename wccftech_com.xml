			<p>Sony is taking a page out of Nintendo's book with its console variations. Just like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/">Nintendo released a Japanese-language-only variation of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a version of the console that is only sold in Japan and only has Japanese as an available language on the device, Sony is doing the same with a new Japanese-language-only digital PS5 console. Also, just like the Japan-only variant of the Switch 2, it's slightly cheaper than getting the standard version.</p>



<p>You could argue that it was an odd choice by Sony to end its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event</a> with not a new game reveal or announcement, but the reveal of a Japan-only PS5 console, but you can't really act surprised since the whole event was meant for the Japanese consumer. From that angle, it makes perfect sense to try persuading anyone who hasn't bought in on the PS5 yet in Japan with a new, cheaper version they can run out and buy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, a standard digital PS5 in Japan costs ¥72,980 ($475), though this new regional variant will drop the price to ¥55,000 ($355), which is more than a solid discount. But that's still more expensive than what the price of the console when it launched in 2020, which was ¥39,980 ($260). This new price is actually a bit of a middle ground compared to where the price of the console was at launch, and where it is now after two price increases.</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the world, players in Japan who have not yet bought a PS5 are going to get the best deal currently available, since $355 USD is significantly cheaper than the price of the console elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Sony brings this same tactic to the PS5 Pro, to extend the reach of its higher-end model. </p>

			<p>Arc System Works was one of the studios we predicted would appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a>, specifically with a release date for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Well, we were right that we'd get to see Arc System Works and with more Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, but we did not get a release date revealed, and are still saddled with an expected release window of '2026.' That said, there is a new closed beta lined up before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Arc System Works also showed off more gameplay for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, and two of the game's developers also made an appearance during the live stream to talk more about the game, and how the studio wanted to blend Japanese art styles with the style of the comic books.</p>



<p>The new closed beta will run from December 5-7, and adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider to the roster of playable characters to try out in the beta. It'll also include two new stages, and a bevy of fixes and tweaks based on feedback from the game's first closed beta earlier this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you registered for the first closed beta and participated, then you'll be automatically registered for this one. If you registered for the first one and didn't participate, then you should keep an eye on your email inbox for an invitation. If you didn't register for the first closed beta but want to try your luck this time, then <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">you can register at this link</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is due to launch on PC and PS5 sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>Just as the community <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">was bemoaning the lack of post-launch support</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a> that new DLC is coming to Elden Ring Nightreign, and it'll arrive before the end of the year. The new expansion, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>This paid DLC expansion adds a few new features to the game, with two new playable Nightfarers to players to try out, two new bosses that FromSoftware is currently being quite tight-lipped about, and what sounds like a new area to explore within Limveld.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are called the Scholar and the Undertaker. The Scholar is described as "<em>boasting impressive arcane levels,</em>" and gains "<em>incredible advantages through battlefield observation</em>," while the Undertaker features "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>."</p>



<p>It's not exactly an in-depth description of either character's kit, but it's seemingly all we get for now. We'll definitely learn more the closer we get to the DLC's launch.</p>



<p>As far as the new bosses, all FromSoftware marketing representative Miku Watanabe has to say in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation Blog post</a> is: "<em>Players will confront two new bosses tormenting Limveld</em>." So, it seems like the new bosses also go in the category of, 'things we'll learn about later.'</p>



<p>Lastly, the DLC also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that has opened up in Limveld that players will get to explore in the new DLC, described as a place that is "<em>strewn with exotic ruins and temples; sacred towers denoting the remains of an ancient people; and crystals that exude a cursed, life-draining miasma</em>."</p>



<p>The DLC will be available for $15 USD, though if you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Nightreign, then you'll just get the DLC added to your library when it arrives on December 4, 2025. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to learn more about the DLC.</p>
