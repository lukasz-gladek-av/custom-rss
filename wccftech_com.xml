			<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit, the mobile game based on Capcom's iconic franchise and developed by JOYCITY Corporation, launched just 10 days ago on November 18, 2025. Since that launch, it has surpassed 2 million downloads on iOS and Android devices, JOYCITY Corporation and publisher Aniplex Inc. have announced.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">was revealed this past July</a>, and was pitched as a "<em>fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe</em>" by Shinji Hashimoto, co-creator of Resident Evil and the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Hashimoto led development on the project, which takes the world of Resident Evil and blends it with real-time strategy gameplay. </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>◤ Resident Evil Survival Unit Surpasses 2 Million Downloads! ◢</p><p>Resident Evil Survival Unit has officially reached 2 million cumulative downloads! <br>Thank you all so much for your amazing support.</p><p>To show our appreciation, we’re giving every Operative a special Promo Code.… <a href="https://t.co/96yaFHJ79J">pic.twitter.com/96yaFHJ79J</a></p></div>— Resident Evil Survival Unit (@RE_SU_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_SU_EN/status/1994347554163900725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to a press release, when Survival Unit launched, it immediately shot up to be the number one game on the Google Play Store's free charts in the US, and on the iOS App Store was the number one free downloaded app in over 15 countries, including Japan, the UK, France and Germany.</p>



<p>As part of celebrating the milestone, Aniplex Inc. and JOYCITY Corporation are giving players an in-game reward that can be redeemed with a promo code "<em>2M SURVIVORS"</em> through the game's official promo code redemption site.</p>



<p>While it's still early days for Survival Unit, it seems that this latest mobile effort for the Resident Evil franchise is faring much better than Capcom's previous attempts with porting Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village to iOS. Though the ports themselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtuber-plays-resident-evil-village-on-external-moniter-using-usb-c-cable-on-iphone-15-pro/">are impressive and open the door to a new avenue of gaming</a>, the ports were certified flops, with Resident Evil 7 reportedly selling less than 2000 copies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If Survival Unit continues to be successful, then we'll probably see Capcom try more partnerships like this with its horror franchise, while keeping its mainline games on PC and console devices. </p>

			<p>A new trademark from Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment has players wondering if we're a little less than two weeks away from getting our first proper look at Control 2, the highly anticipated sequel to Remedy's excellent 2019 third-person action game, Control. Players are speculating that this new trademark for "<em>Control: Resonant</em>" is the title for the coming sequel, and that the timing of the trademark means we'll get to see it at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, the trademark was filed by Nordia Attorneys at Law Ltd. on November 27, 2025. According to MP1st, Nordia Attorneys at Law Ltd. is the legal firm Remedy works with for all their trademarks, which is what ties this trademark back to Remedy. The filing date is also significant because if we are getting a reveal at The Game Awards, then Remedy has likely pushed the filing as close to the event as possible to avoid leaks months in advance, instead of weeks.</p>



<p>The filing's tags also point to it being the game that Remedy fans have been waiting for since 2019, as they include "<em>video game services</em>." That said, they also include a tag for "<em>the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films</em>." That second tag creates a murkier picture of what this trademark could be for.</p>



<p>It could be that the trademark is for the video game Control 2, which will be called Control Resonant, and the tag for TV and film creation is future-proofing for Remedy to adapt its Control games into TV series and films. </p>



<p>However, that situation could be flipped. We already know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/">Remedy signed a deal with Annapurna Interactive,</a> which includes Annapurna helping to finance development on Control 2, and Remedy agreeing to work with Annapurna to develop a film and/or TV series adaptation.</p>



<p>So, this trademark could be for the coming TV series or film adaptation project Remedy is working with Annapurna on, which means that the "<em>video game services</em>" tag could be future-proofing in the opposite direction, from a film/TV series to a video game.</p>



<p>In March 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/">Remedy confirmed that Control 2 had entered full production</a>, which means that by the time we get to The Game Awards on December 11, it'll have been in full production for at least nine months. It's not impossible to believe that Remedy has also used that time to put together a trailer to showcase at the industry's largest end-of-year event.</p>



<p>It would also be an appropriate time to get a trailer for Control 2. With the game having only entered full production this year, we can't assume it'll be ready for 2026. But the trailers shown at The Game Awards are sometimes more than a year in advance of the game's release, so we are likely in for a few announcements that have a '2027' release window alongside them. Control 2 could very well be one of those trailers.</p>



<p>That historical precedent, paired with Remedy's financial goals for 2027 and 2030, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-isnt-satisfied-recent-sales-remains-confident-significant-commercial-success/">as discussed in its most recent third-quarter financial report</a>, points to Remedy likely getting ready to ramp up marketing for its next projects. So, keep your eyes peeled for anything that looks or sounds Control-related at this year's show. It feels like we're getting closer to a proper return to the Oldest House.</p>
