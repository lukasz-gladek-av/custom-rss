			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>

<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>

● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-7/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features more than 100 notes to collect and read, and it's worth searching for each one. Compulsion Games knocked it out of the park regarding storytelling in South of Midnight, and these notes are no exception.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll notice more notes to grab in this chapter than in any previous chapter. So if you were going to try and find them yourself, it's best to be vigilant about searching an area before you move on.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you want to make sure you don't miss any of the 15 notes in Chapter 7. Here's where to grab each one.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 had 11 notes to find, Chapter 6 had 10, and now Chapter 7 has 15. And that's not even the most you'll see in a single chapter. But that's still to come.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Lost Boy</strong> - At the start of the chapter, follow the path until you hear Hazel point out the old sawmill, which will happen just before you're about to jump across a river. Jump across, and turn left to find a climbing path that leads you up and around the rock wall to an area blocked by the bramble and vines. You'll find the note on a box next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lost Liquor</strong> - You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the chapter. Once you've cleared it, look to the right and you'll likely be able to spy a health filament behind some branches. You'll find the note resting on some boxes just ahead of the branches, and since you're there, you might as well grab the filament.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lieutenant Laurent</strong> - When you reach the memory object showing a clip of Hazel's mother, look to your right. You'll find the note on an old dresser at the entrance to a path with a box and a Floof knot to jump to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Babblin' Boy</strong> - After finding the last note and crossing the river, turn left to find a path blocked by some branches you can push out of the way. Behind them, you'll find the note on a box next to a metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Baby Faced Laurent</strong> - From the last note, follow the path, and you'll have to cross the river again, using echoes of a bridge to do so. Once you've passed the echo bridge, turn left, and you'll find this note on a box next to another metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lil' Drunkards</strong> - After finding the last note, follow the path and jump over two big bramble vines. You'll see this note in a hollow dead tree that should be directly in front of you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>End of Prohibition -&nbsp;</strong>After clearing the combat encounter that ends with you using Crouton to clear the Stigma, you'll head under a large tree as you follow the path to leave. This note is to the right of the path, underneath the tree.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Boy out of Time</strong> - You'll find this note almost immediately after you find the last one. Once you walk beyond the tree, you'll see a building to your right. The note is resting on a structure just on the porch of the building.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Heart of Lace</strong> - After the cutscene with Laurent at the Juke Joint, head back into the shop and go up the stairs. You'll find this note on a box next to Laurent and Lacey's picture.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> - Once you reach Milltown after using the grapple, head straight down the path, and you'll find this note inside the house on the right, on a table next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Mother's Last Words</strong> - Inside the same house you find the last note in, this note is on a bedframe at the back of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Everything Helps</strong> - When you enter Milltown, you'll be able to see a broken-down well to your left. Turn left past the well, and then look to your right to see a building that's missing a wall. Walk into the building to find this note on a box on your right, just ahead of a combat encounter.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Father's Job</strong> - After clearing the combat arena just beyond the last note you found, and watching the first of Laurent's memories, this one will be waiting for you in a building to the right of a big crane, next to two giant saws crossed over each other and making an 'X'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Penny Saved</strong> - You'll find this one on the second floor of the sawmill, which you reach after finding all four of Laurent's memories. When you make it to the second floor, you'll use your grapple to cross a big gap around the outside of he mill. Once you're back inside, look to your left to see some wood you can push out of the way. Push that, then another bundle of wood, and you'll see this note resting on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Maintaining Productivity</strong> - This last note can be found in the office, just beyond where you found the previous note. You'll also find a Floof knot in this office, right next to the note on a desk.</p>
<p>And that's where you can find all 15 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 7. If you've followed these guides so far, you'll have found 53 out of the 103. Only 50 more to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo streamed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/">Mario Kart World Direct</a> this morning, which included a more detailed look at gameplay in Mario Kart World, and some of the new features players can expect.</p>
<p>The presentation was only 15 minutes long, and was a back-to-back dive into different aspects of Mario Kart World, like some of the new courses, characters, tricks, items and game modes for players in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>We know plenty of the big news about Mario Kart World, like the fact that the new open-world setting means we can drive anywhere and spend time freely roaming around the world and the tracks. The direct also showed for the first time that there are plenty of challenges and hidden items to find while doing so, like blue-coin P challenges to discover, hidden coins and hidden panels.</p>
<p>You can also use photo mode whenever you want while in free roam, and if you're playing with friends online, or even locally, you don't necessarily jump into a race or Grand Prix to play together. You can instead just drive around the world, enjoy the views, and create your own fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased eight of the courses we'll all be racing on, with some returning tracks players will recognize and some brand new. Rest assured there is more than what was shown, but the ones we got to look at were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario Shipyard</li>
</ul>
<p>We also got a not-so-slight-hint that to unlock Mario Kart World's version of the infamous Rainbow Road, you'll have to complete and win each of the Grand Prix's in the game. Regarding the characters you can race as, we once again didn't get a look at the full roster, but we did get a closer look at four of the new racers, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Cow</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Lakitu</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of new items, six items were highlighted in the direct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Feather</li>
<li>Ice Flower</li>
<li>Coin Shell</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the six shown, being able to use Kamek's magic looks like it will be the most interesting one, and the one with the potential to really shake things up in the race, as you transform your competing racers into various things. The rest seem like your bog-standard hazards and boosts, though when combined with the increased number of road hazards that'll just appear in each track, which we also got a look at, these races are shaping up to be some of the most hectic in the entire series.</p>
<p>Nintendo also confirmed that the racing wheel for the Joy-Con controllers is back with the Joy-Con 2 Wheel, purpose-built for the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, and racers new to the series will have similar features included in Mario Kart 8, like smart steering at their disposal, should they need it.</p>
<p>The last two new features shown in the direct that seem to bring a good deal of change to the game were two new tricks, Rewind and Charge Jump. The latter is kind of like an ollie on a skateboard, where you'll just jump straight up to help you avoid obstacles, but also jump onto grind rails to reach new areas, and find new paths on each track.</p>
<p>Rewind does exactly what it sounds like it does, and rewinds what you've just done in-game so you can try again. But you're not rewinding the entire race when you use it, you're only rewinding the actions you've taken. Which means if you rewind while in 1st place because you want to try grinding a rail again, you can put yourself in 2nd just to try and get that sick clip.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a solid showcase of what's to come in Mario Kart World, but whether it did as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Doug Bowser</a> hoped it would, and convince players that Mario Kart World is worth its $80 price tag, is to be determined.</p>
<p>If you want to check out more about Mario Kart World, you can read what we thought when we went <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the game at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 event</a>.</p>
