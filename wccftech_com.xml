			<p>Developer and publisher DON'T NOD has <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">published its latest financial release</a> which goes over its half-year results for 2025, which includes a few notable updates from the studio, like how its most recent release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage performed "<em>below expectations</em>," and that the studio signed a deal with Netflix to make a narrative game based on "<em>a major IP</em>."</p>



<p>It's definitely a disappointing result for DON'T NOD, particularly considering the fact that its last major releases last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant, also fell below expectations</a>. The studio's total operating revenue took a 5% dip compared to last year for the same time period at €13.9 million.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the future appears a little more promising for DON'T NOD, with the release of its most recent published title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-nod-published-the-lonesome-guild-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-demo-now-on-steam/">The Lonesome Guild,</a> which arrived on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S last week on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>More importantly, its newly signed deal with Netflix to create a new narrative title based on what's described as "<em>a major IP</em>" could prove to be a saving grace for the studio as it begins work on the title at its studio in Montreal, with Netflix signed on to publish the game.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that goes, though, because while games with a stronger narrative focus like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, and Dead Take are proving there's an appetite for strong storytelling in games, Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">shuttered its Squid Game: Unleashed studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, just days ago</a>.</p>



<p>Could that just be Netflix wanting to move away from internally developing and publishing games going forward? Sure. Could it also be that Netflix is becoming more cautious of its participation in the video game industry overall? Absolutely, it could be. For now, it has a deal to publish this new game from DON'T NOD. Hopefully, this deal will work out for the Paris-based developer.</p>
