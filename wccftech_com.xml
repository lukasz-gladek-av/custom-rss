			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would help boost sales, as it's one of the most popular and best-selling game franchises out there. As a result, US games consumer spending is rising once more in the month of October, with the sales being boosted nicely by the launch of Call of Duty. This information comes from<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sales-up-10-following-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-us-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Circana's monthly report</a>, which says that hardware, software, and accessories sales combined have gone up by 10% year-on-year for a sum of $4.7 billion. Activision confirmed with The Washington Post that with the inclusion of Black Ops 6, the franchise as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole surpassed 500 million units</a> sold. This statistic makes it one of the best-selling game franchises of all time.</p>
<p>Content represented $4.23 billion of that sum, which is a 12% rise compared to October 2023. Hardware sales were down by 23%, making it a sum of $249 million.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched and immediately hit number one in the October charts, becoming the third best-selling game of 2024 to date. Subscription spending also increased, which can also be attributed to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as this was the first game in the franchise to be a day-one release on Game Pass. In the report, Circana stated that non-mobile subscriptions grew by 16% compared to last year, making it evident that Black Ops 6 played a massive part in this. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">Xbox further verified this information</a>, as they announced that the title was breaking records for Game Pass subscriptions at the end of October.</p>
<p>The report also goes on to mention that console content was the biggest contributor to the rise in content spending, providing a 27% increase compared to the same period last year, with the rise being driven by digital full-game sales. Again, Black Ops 6 is to thank for this. Confirmed by Circana's Mat Piscatella, it's been confirmed that PlayStation platforms accounted for 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 total console full game dollar sales during October.</p>
<p>"Over its first two weeks in market, full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 were 23% higher than the full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 over its first two weeks in a market a year ago," says Piscatella. Overall, this information isn't too much of a surprise, as Modern Warfare 3 wasn't as well received as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been.</p>
<p>Along with the new Call of Duty, games like Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Silent Hill 2, and Metaphor: ReFantazio were amongst the top-selling games from October 6 to November 2.</p>
