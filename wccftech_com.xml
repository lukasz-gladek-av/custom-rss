			<p>Techland has released a new update for Dying Light: The Beast with Update 1.5, which adds a new difficulty layer called the Nightmare Experience, new survival mechanics, and a new Alpha Volatile. This update quickly follows after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-update-1-4-adds-ray-tracing-on-pc-new-game-legend-levels-and-many-improvements/">Update 1.4, which Techland said was the game's "<em>biggest update yet</em>,"</a> and rounds out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-roadmap-ray-tracing-pc-new-game-plus/">the most recent roadmap</a> Techland released for the game.</p>



<p>Update 1.4 added elements like new game plus, support for ray tracing on PC, and over 400 improvements across graphical updates and bug fixes. Update 1.5 lets players experience all of that with even more new gameplay conditions, as elements like the new survival mechanics now mean players have to be worried about their food consumption and how hungry they get. The longer you go without food, the longer your stamina and health take to regenerate. Your flashlight will also drain over time, and as the battery gets low, the light will dim and flicker, so you'll have to find replacement batteries either out in the town or by crafting them. </p>



<p>The new Alpha Volatiles are now the most powerful infected in Castor Woods, not just for their strength but for their intelligence. They'll ignore the UV light, and unlike other Volatiles that may lose your scent if you run and hide fast enough, they'll be able to keep hunting you all across the map until you reach a safe zone.</p>



<p>The Nightmare Experience difficulty is the highest challenge available in Dying Light: The Beast, which, you won't be surprised to learn, Techland only recommends for the most seasoned Dying Light players.</p>



<p>"<em>It makes Human and Infected enemies stronger, smarter, more aggressive, reacting faster to players' actions using their heightened senses</em>," <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/update-15">a blog post from the official website reads</a> on the new update. It goes on to say that when playing on the Nightmare Experience difficulty, some Dark Zones in the game will now feature Volatiles during the day. Also, on top of everything else, as you might expect, resources will be far more scarce on Nightmare compared to other difficulties, so keeping yourself alive is all the more challenging.</p>



<p>When Dying Light: The Beast launched earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">I reviewed it for Wccftech</a>, writing, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>

			<p>While Unreal Engine 5's Lumen and Nanite redefined modern visuals, the engine makes more than a few gamers shudder in fear due to its heavy system requirements and its widely known <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">performance and stuttering issues</a></strong>, which prevent many from enjoying games powered by the engine properly, especially on PC.</p>



<p>Since the engine's launch, however, Epic has attempted to mitigate these issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/"><strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong></a> seems to be yet another step in the right direction.</p>



<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights the performance improvements introduced in the latest version of the engine by running the Unreal Engine 5.4 and Unreal Engine 5.7 versions of the <a href="https://scansfactory.gumroad.com/l/DEMO-Venice"><strong>Photorealistic Venice Tech Demo created by Scans Factory</strong></a> running side-by-side.</p>



<p>In terms of performance on an RTX 5080 GPU, <em>"GPU performance is improved by up to 25% in UE 5.7 (depending on a scene), and the 5.7 version is now better utilizing GPU resources, hence the GPU power draw is now higher," </em>writes the YouTuber. </p>



<p>CPU performance on an Intel Core i7-14700F is significantly improved, up to 35%, which leads, according to MxBenchmarkPC, to <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"more stable frametimes with less hitches across all scenes."</em> This last improvement is particularly welcome, as the biggest issue in most games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is unstable frametimes that lead to a choppy and very unpleasant experience.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also brings some image quality improvements, as MxBenchmarkPC highlighted in their analysis. <em>"In terms of image quality, UE 5.7 offers more stable and accurate Lumen lighting, and especially higher quality Lumen reflections (with better performance at the same time)."</em> Unfortunately, Lumen denoising quality has only been improved slightly, so tech like NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction still does a better job than the engine's native solution.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it will be a while to see games built to take advantage of the enhancements introduced in Unreal Engine 5.7, the fact that Epic continues to address some of the engine's most critical flaws is encouraging, and bodes well for the future. Hopefully, it won't take too long to finally see Unreal Engine 5 games running smoothly even on mid-range PC hardware.</p>
