			<p>Tim Cain, the veteran game designer known primarily as the original creator of Fallout, has returned to work at Obsidian Entertainment in a full-time capacity.</p>



<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from his personal YouTube channel</a>, where Cain regularly posts videos about the games industry as a whole. The Fallout creator had gone into 'semi-retirement' in June 2020, after nine years as a full-time employee of Obsidian, during which he worked on South Park: The Stick of Truth, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a> as a programmer, and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> as its co-director alongside Leonard Boyarsky (whom he previously worked with on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines). Cain also contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which launched just two months ago, but only as a creative consultant.</p>



<p>Now, however, it seems like his early retirement is over, and he's also moved back to Southern California to work in-person at the studio:</p>



<p><em>I should point out that I'm back at Obsidian. I'm their full-time employee and in person, so not remote. I'm not a contractor anymore. This means that I'm not working in other places, although there's at least one game that I worked on that I know is going to ship. I don't know if it'll be next year or the year after, but a game's going to come out that's not an Obsidian game. They'll have my name in the credits because I did work for it for it. There are other games I worked on. I'm not sure they're going to ship. The 2020 to 2025 was a weird time in the industry and a lot of games got started and a lot of games got cancelled. So, I really don't know the status of all the games that I contracted on.</em></p>



<p><em>I also can't talk about the project I'm working on at Obsidian just because, you know, that's covered under NDA. Don't bother guessing. You're not going to guess right.</em></p>



<p>A recent rumor shared by former Obsidian founder Chris Avellone <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the studio may not be planning to make a new The Outer Worlds entry, at least for now. That, coupled with the return of Cain, is more than enough to get Fallout: New Vegas fans hyped about the possibility of seeing him team up once more with Leonard Boyarsky (who also worked on the first two Fallout titles) on New Vegas 2 or another Fallout spin-off. However, Cain's tease that fans won't guess right appears to be a nudge that the project is actually a new IP.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's certainly great news that such an esteemed RPG designer, whose credits also include cult classics like Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and The Temple of Elemental Evil (which is about to be re-released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843520/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, by the way), is back at work on new projects. Obsidian has the ambitious goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-wont-chase-huge-profits-or-grow-aggressively-plans-to-last-100-years-in-the-rpg-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to make great RPGs for the next 100 years</a> without chasing big profits or turning into a massive studio, and Cain's presence will help keep them on the right course.</p>



<p>The team is also looking to satisfy people's hunger for deeper RPGs, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-want-deeper-rpgs-says-the-outer-worlds-2-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while ago by the director of The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and the return of the original Fallout creator will undoubtedly be a boon to that end.</p>
