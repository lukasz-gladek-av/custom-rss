			<p>If you want to just relive your childhood in your free time, why not try Vice City in your browser?</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-vice-city-demo-is-now-directly-playable-in-a-web-browser-on-dos-zone-allowing-the-game-to-be-played-on-various-devices">GTA: Vice City Demo is Now Directly Playable in a Web Browser on DOS Zone, Allowing the Game to be Played on Various Devices</h2>



<p>While GTA: Vice City can be easily run on a potato PC, you will still need to download and install it via platforms like Steam. The game is also available for mobile devices based on Android and iOS, and will cost you a few bucks, but if you want to play it for free (and without downloading), you can now play it directly on your browser.</p>



<p>Originally released in 2002 on PlayStation 2 and later on PC and Xbox, Vice City is now playable on your browser, thanks to the DOZ Zone, which is currently hosting a technology demo on the website. The browser-playable version isn't an official release from Rockstar Games, but it's a fan-created port of the game. The project is powered by a technology demo built on WebAssembly and browser APIs, and uses open-source engine implementations like reVC to recreate Vice City's gameplay without installation.</p>

<p>On the DOS Zone website, the game runs entirely in the browser and doesn't require any download or installation, unlike on a PC or mobile phone. As long as you have a modern browser like Chrome or Edge, you will be able to run it on any device of your choice. All you need to do is click on the "play demo" button, and you are good to go. On mobile, you will have dedicated touch interfaces, while on PC, you can play it via your keyboard/mouse or a controller. </p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the demo does not include the full original game assets. Players will be prompted to upload the files legally purchased from the Vice City copy in order to access the complete campaign. That said, you can still move around, drive a bike or car, and check out places to feel your childhood on the go. </p>
