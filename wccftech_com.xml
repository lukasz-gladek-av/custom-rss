			<p>Many great platformers were released this year, but one in particular stole the show. This list will compile some of the greatest platforming games released this year if you want a game that's fun for all the family or seek to introduce someone to gaming. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five best platformers of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a></em></p>

<h2>Astro Bot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">9.3/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that Astro Bot is on top. The game was well-received by critics and users across the globe, and many got to go on a journey of nostalgia and celebrate Sony's expansive lineage. Compared to Astro's Playroom, Astro Bot is a fully thought-out game where you get to jump, climb, glide, and fly across expansive levels while saving bots that are cameos from Sony's iconic games. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h2>
<p>For fans of the Sonic franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was a dream come true. Although fans initially thought it was going just to be a simple remaster, it is evident that the game is much more than that and provides more content than players expected. Not only did the graphics receive a massive boost and give more detail than ever to both Sonic and Shadow, but it seems that a bit of Sonic Frontiers rubbed off on the game, too.</p>
<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is a great title if you want to introduce your children to gaming or get them to love the Sonic franchise, too. There may be some difficult moments, but you can always step in and complete the boss fight for them if they're struggling a lot.</p>

<h2>Mario vs. Donkey Kong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-vs-donkey-kong/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It isn't all that shocking that a Nintendo game has made it into one of the top spots for best Platformer of 2024. If there's one thing that Nintendo does best, it's this genre. Mario vs Donkey Kong was released in February this year.</p>
<p>For those who played the original, this may serve as a sweet hit of nostalgia. For those new to the game, it's still a fun time all around. This game has plenty of value for money, too, as you can play through over 130 levels, experiencing the classic platformer in a new light. Here's what Nathan Birch said in Wccftech's review:</p>
<p><em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong may lack the razzle dazzle of its stars’ more recent games, but this remake still has the power to hook players with its tried-and-true retro platforming and a finely-tuned difficulty curve that culminates in some challenges that will truly test your mind and reflexes. Those who have played the original Mario vs. DK to death may not find quite enough new content here, but lapsed fans and new players are in for a barrel of fun.</em></p>
<h2>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey was a fantastic game that was first released in 2010 on the Nintendo Wii. Fast forward 14 years, and we have now experienced the remastered release of Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's a fantastic game and a great way to introduce youngsters to gaming. It takes you on a journey through Disney's forgotten history while you get to wield a paintbrush to help you traverse the terrain, as well as utilize your paintbrush to take on bosses in the world.</p>
<p>For what it is, the game is a pretty great remaster of a Disney classic title and will provide a lot of nostalgia for those who played and loved the original. Some systems were improved, while others fell behind a little bit. While it is a fantastic game, it's undoubtedly no Astro Bot and does have some flaws that may make the game a bit tiresome after a while.</p>

<h2>The Plucky Squire (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-plucky-squire-a-zelda-love-letter/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the perfect game if you want to introduce young children to gaming. While some of the mechanics may seem a little bit complicated at first, it's very easy to get the hang of and really accessible. When it comes to platformers that were released this year, The Plucky Squire is incredibly unique in the way it tackles traversal and movement through the game.</p>
<p>It's more than just a platformer, though, as there's also fun combat to engage in, a storyline to experience, and lots of collectibles to discover as you solve puzzles. The game is a lot of fun and great for anyone of any age.</p>

			<p>At the moment, the reason behind these hacks is unknown, but clearly, it's so that they can get their hands on the valuable resources that can help you to become powerful in the late game. Path of Exile 2 finally made its way into <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Early Access after being highly anticipated</a> by those who are fans of the cRPG genre. However, it seems that those who are in the late game have logged on to find that their accounts have been compromised, with highly valuable resources missing from their stash and their inventories. Since inventories are shared between characters, this allows for easier leveling of any other classes that the player may try out. To lose such valuable items is a huge, devastating loss, as a lot of them require a ton of grinding to be able to obtain them in the first place.</p>
<p>Most shockingly, it seems that the hackers managed to make it past Steam 2FA without a bat of an eye. Some of those who were affected have said that they received an email from someone trying to get into their account, but somehow, they still managed to slide past the Steam 2FA anyway. If it's that easy to do, it means that Steam will likely have a bigger problem than just what is currently going on with Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>People are sharing their stories on the<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3667200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official Path of Exile forums</a>, where they share how they found out that their accounts had been compromised. It doesn't spell good news for those who were impacted, as Grinding Gear Games has said that they are unable to roll back the materials that were stolen by other players, basically leaving players to grind for the materials all over again, with hours of gameplay lost to a hacker.</p>
<p>It's reported that the hacker is known on the forums, as he would share updates as he was going. However, he would continuously change his username, making it hard to keep track of him. Whether there were more people involved remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn't just impacting Path of Exile 2. Even those who are still playing the original Path of Exile are finding their resources impacted, with tons of Gems and other valuable resources completely missing from their account. As a result of the hack, some players are finding that their accounts have now been banned, and they have lost access to the game.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games is tackling this and is working to resolve the bans on accounts that were impacted, but it's said that this process can take weeks to deal with, meaning that players won't have access to their Path of Exile 2 accounts for the unforeseeable.</p>
<p>If you've been hacked, please let us know your story in the comments.</p>
