			<p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">New York Times</a> on Monday revealed that <strong>Meta</strong> would be <strong>laying off 10% of its Reality Labs</strong> division, the branch of its business under which it works on products like the Metaverse, and also houses its internal VR teams under <strong>Oculus Studios</strong>, including <strong>Deadpool VR</strong> developer <strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asgards-wrath-ii-hands-on-impressions-vrs-breakout-untethered-rpg/">Asgard's Wrath 2</a></strong> developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquired-sanzaru-games-asgards-wrath-for-its-oculus-studios/">Sanzaru Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, as developers began sharing the news that they had been impacted by the cuts, we learned that at least two whole studios, the aforementioned Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games, <strong>would be shut down</strong>, with the entirety of their teams laid off.</p>



<p>The first signal came from <strong>Andy Gentile</strong>, a designer at Twisted Pixel, who shared on his <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">X (formerly Twitter) account</a> that not only had he been laid off, but the entire studio, along with Sanzaru Games, had been shut down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear how many people have been impacted by the cuts, but more developers have come forward to confirm the news of the two studios shutting down, including a senior level designer at Sanzaru, Ray West, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on his personal LinkedIn page</a>, "<em>Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru.</em> <em>It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know everyone there.</em>"</p>



<p>Twisted Pixel is known for titles like Deadpool VR, 'Splosion Man, and Path of the Warrior, while Sanzaru was highly regarded for its Asgard's Wrath titles, the second of which is commonly known as one of the best VR titles to release in recent years. </p>



<p>Sanzaru also has a place in the hearts of many longtime PlayStation fans, as it was also the team that ported the first three Sly Cooper games to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and even developed the fourth entry in the franchise, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. Sanzaru was also responsible for ports of the God of War Collection and Secret Agent Clank.</p>



<p>Both studios were founded in 2006, which means that Meta is shuttering them just as they were set to hit their 20th anniversaries. A milestone that not many studios get to hit anymore in today's unstable video game industry. It's altogether an unfortunate start to 2026, and a sign that the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry for the last few years aren't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Is This a Joke?” Asks Battlefield 6 Players as Season 2 Confirmed to be Delayed to February 2026]]></title>

			<p><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was one of the biggest commercial successes in 2025, not just for <strong>EA</strong>, but across the video game industry overall. It was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>, and as of November 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">it was the best-selling game in the US overall</a>. But while EA has been enjoying its commercial success, the players around the game have begun to feel the lack of new content, with concurrent player numbers (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">at least on Steam</a>) practically falling off the map compared to where they were when the game launched.</p>



<p>That's why, when EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">today's January Update blog</a> that the next major batch of content, <strong>Season 2</strong>, wouldn't arrive until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, one of the first comments, which sums up community sentiment quite well, was, "<em>Is this a joke?</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">October 10, 2025</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Season 1 and its highly anticipated REDSEC battle royale mode launching on October 28, 2025</a>. Since October 28, there have been content updates for the game as part of Season 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/">with the introduction of new maps and limited-time modes</a>, but the launch of Season 2 arriving in February means that players will have gone almost four months without any major new content.</p>



<p>To a certain vintage of player, it may seem ludicrous for this to be an issue the community is complaining about, but that's simply the world we live in when it comes to modern-day live-service titles. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong>, for example, doesn't let its community go a single month without new content, with a new season every two months and new characters and maps introduced at the halfway point. </p>



<p>Like it or not, that is the pace of modern live-service games, and while Battlefield 6 and Marvel Rivals offer different experiences to players, if EA hopes to keep up with free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals, it can't keep players waiting months for new maps.</p>



<p>In fairness to EA and Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect), the team is aware that this is a longer wait than players would have expected, and claims the decision was made "<em>in order to keep our promise</em>" to the community to deliver the best possible experience. </p>



<p>"<em>During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2</em>," the team writes. </p>



<p>"<em>Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2</em>."</p>



<p>As part of Season 1 getting extended, EA is adding new cosmetics, free rewards, and XP bonuses for players, including a Frostfire Bonus Path that players will be able to complete alongside the Season 1 battle pass rather than having to choose between them, which is how players currently work through the several battle pass paths. There will also be a Valentine's Day update arriving later, with double XP weekends, login rewards, and more. </p>



<p>It's a nice attempt from EA to try and hold players over until Season 2 is ready, but it's doubtful community sentiment will change until we start to see what Season 2 will bring. Hopefully, it's enough to bring the players who have dropped Battlefield 6 due to a lack of content back to the game. Otherwise, EA and Battlefield Studios may be in for a rough 2026.</p>
