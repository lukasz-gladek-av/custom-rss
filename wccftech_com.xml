			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 modding scene continues to improve CD Projekt RED's game in multiple areas. We previously covered mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-third-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add proper third-person</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-cyberpunk-2077-mod-combat-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve combat</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-game-save-companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add permanent companions</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase immersion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-dreampunk-3-1-1-enhanced-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Now, modder cradilyex has uploaded '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Traffic Overhaul</a>' to the Nexus website. This mod's goal is to add vehicles that are present in the base game but are missing from traffic, depending on the Night City district. For example, you will see gang vehicles patrolling their turf, NCPD vehicles patrolling rich areas, taxis and buses, Delamains and big trucks in industrial areas, Militech and Wraiths in the Badlands region, and Moxes in Kabuki. What's even more interesting is that the players can tweak everything through a handy menu. You could, for instance, greatly increase Scav presence or Police presence in a district and do the exact opposite in another, depending on your vision for that district.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod also lets you introduce modded vehicles into regular Cyberpunk 2077 traffic by adding their entity names (such as "Vehicle.oranje3_militech_legatus" for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Militech Legatus SPD-10</a>) to the lists in "r6/scripts/NightCityTrafficOverhaul/NCTOmoddedVehicles.reds". </p>



<p>According to the modder, the vehicle swap itself has no impact on performance. However, depending on the chosen traffic density and your hardware, performance may decrease in certain instances. Moreover, some modded vehicles could also reduce performance.</p>



<p>Night City Traffic Overhaul is compatible with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taxi Work in Night City</a>, which adds missions where you transport passengers as a cab driver, and with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Alive</a>, which adds motorbikes to traffic, makes gang members able to drive through the city, and both civilians and NCPD more aware and reactive to what happens around them.</p>



<p>It is no doubt impressive what modders can do with Cyberpunk 2077 despite the lack of full modding tools. The Witcher 3 eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got REDkit in May 2024</a>; hopefully, CD Projekt RED can release a similar tool for their other game, too. It would help fans tide themselves over until the sequel, which might very well feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer modes</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-series-creator-keanu-reeves-return-johnny-silverhand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand</a>.</p>

			<p>New Valve hardware, potentially including the highly anticipated Steam Frame VR headset and a new Steam Controller, could be announced as early as Wednesday, November 12, according to online rumors. More critically, the timing suggests this could be accompanied by a reveal for the long-rumored HLX project (Half-Life 3).</p>



<p>The rumor originates from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley">Brad Lynch</a>, a known and highly reliable source for Valve hardware and display leaks. Lynch revealed on Discord, as reported on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ot28nw/sadlyitsbradley_steam_frame_information_likely/">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, that new hardware announcements are imminent. The announcement for the Steam Frame VR headset is expected to precede pre-orders by a week or two, giving Valve time to explain the device's technical features properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame-a-considerable-step-forward">Steam Frame: A Considerable Step Forward</h2>



<p>The announcement of the long-rumored new Valve headset, previously codenamed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-vr-headset-valve-might-have-entered-production/">"Deckard,"</a> is likely going to be the focus of this possible set of announcements. If its rumored features are true, the Steam Frame represents a fundamental step up from the Index headset, and a significant change in VR philosophy for the company.</p>



<p>According to leaks, the Steam Frame will introduce <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Frames,"</em> which are visual elements like floating windows that give the user a new way to interact with applications, similar in concept to the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-benefiting-other-companies-in-niche-market/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s immersive OS. The "Frames" feature is rumored to be backed up by the specifications below.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Rumored Technical Specifications (Based on Proof of Concept)</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display:</strong> 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Features:</strong> SLAM tracking, eye tracking</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-new-steam-controller-and-capsense-feature">The New Steam Controller and Capsense Feature</h2>



<p>The headset announcement is expected could be accompanied by other hardware reveals, including a new Steam Controller. While an image of the new device hasn't been shared (Brad Lynch shared an AI-made mockup to protect his source), the controller is said to sport a capsense feature similar to the Index controllers, but without full finger tracking.</p>



<p>This capsense feature will allow the device to detect how far the user's hands are from the handle, which could have some interesting applications in terms of comfort and immersion. The lack of full finger tracking shouldn't significantly impact the experience, allowing the company to keep the controller's price as low as possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-could-be-the-steam-frame-s-killer-app">Half-Life 3 Could be the Steam Frame's Killer App</h2>



<p>Even if you are not interested in Valve's upcoming hardware, the rumored announcements set for this week carry immense weight due to the potential software reveal.</p>



<p>With the<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"> HLX project (rumored to be Half-Life 3) having reportedly recently entered a polishing phase</a> , the announcement of the Steam Frame could be accompanied by the reveal of the next entry in the legendary series. Much like Valve did with the Index and Half-Life: Alyx, the new major hardware launch could be tied to the announcement of a game that many had lost hope it would ever see the light of day. Although datamined information suggests the new entry in the series won't be a VR-only game, its reveal would transform this hardware launch into Valve's most significant event since 2019, making this Wednesday essential viewing for any fan of the popular company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Halo Studios has confirmed that Halo: Infinite will receive one final update next week, after which the team will move on. The primary goal will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the 2001 game's campaign, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and slated for launch next year. However, the developers have confirmed that there are actually multiple Halo projects in development; <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, they might be remaking the campaigns of the second and third installments while also working on the next mainline entry.</p>



<p>The final Halo: Infinite update, titled Operation: Infinite, is scheduled to go live on November 18. To begin with, the developers are giving a 2x boost to the earning rate for both Career Rank and Spartan Points (SP) across all matchmaking playlists. This will make it easier to reach the max level and unlock the coveted Mark VI armor kit, the same one worn by the Master Chief in the game's campaign.</p>



<p>The update also introduces a free 100-tier Operation Pass and a 100-tier Premium Pass, both with no expiration date planned. The free Pass unlocks three new armor sets (Serpin, Seeker, Adamant), as well as coatings, visors, and stances. The Premium Pass, on the other hand, lets players unlock five additional unique armor sets (Artificer, Seedwarden, Kobold, Phoenix, First Vanguard), six weapon models, and over thirty exclusive customizations. Instant unlocks for the Premium tier include the Charged Quill Shock Rifle model and Phoenix Gold weapon coating.</p>



<p>Halo Studios also added over 200 never-before-released customization items to The Exchange, such as armor pieces, attachments, coatings, charms, and visors. Items from all previous Operations, Events, and Fractures will be available here alongside commemorative Halo 5: Guardians bundles.</p>



<p>A new festive map called Yuletide will be found in the Quick Play playlist, and a new asymmetrical map, Vacancy, is being added to the Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and select ranked rotational playlists. More Ranked Seasons are on their way and will be reset every few months, allowing the best players to claim exclusive Spartan customizations. Moreover, while Operation: Infinite is the final Halo: Infinite update, players can still look forward to a rotating selection of Daily and Weekly Challenges that offer a variety of ways to level up their Career Rank, progress through Operation Passes, and earn Spartan Points (SP). For more info, you can rewatch the Community Livestream embedded below.</p>

<p>Halo: Infinite launched in December 2021 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a positive reception</a>. The game's free-to-play multiplayer initially garnered acclaim among fans, but the lackluster post-launch support eventually exhausted their excitement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian's classic RPG Fallout: New Vegas is about to get an influx of players, to be sure. The second season of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV show will be available on Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting on Wednesday, December 17</a>, and its setting is indeed New Vegas, as the main characters pursue the traitorous former overseer of Vault 33, Hank MacLean, toward the city. Since the show takes place fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, those who have never experienced the masterpiece game would do well to play it before the TV show airs.</p>



<p>Just in case you need further incentive, a new graphics mod has just been released, and a quest mod will launch a few days before the TV show's second season. The graphics mod, called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94521?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies</a>, was created by doodlum, the main coder behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders</a>. </p>



<p>The modder calls this 'the ultimate clouds mod' and explains that the default game and previous mods previously used clouds from real-world pictures. Perfect Skies, on the other hand, uses computer-generated clouds, avoiding issues such as pixelation and other visual artifacts. Moreover, doodlum developed a proprietary cloud baking system and boasts that it is more advanced than the one featured in Fallout 4 (which launched four years after Fallout: New Vegas and is celebrating its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new edition that comes out today</a>). Perfect Skies features 30 unique cloud variations and 60 4K textures, making up nearly 1GB of cloud textures. That said, the textures are compressed, so the file size is only 220MB.</p>

<iframe title="Fallout: Long 15 - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fsGEorOHZk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The quest mod is called Fallout: Long 15 and takes the player character into NCR territory, entering California through Interstate 15. According to the modding team (which already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a similar mod</a> for the Legion faction called Dry Wells), Long 15 features a huge new worldspace, complete with new quests, factions, and towns. The modders, who have a Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TheLong15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">page</a>, aim to launch Long 15 on Friday, December 12. A new story trailer will go live between late November and early December.</p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Game Director Daniel Vávra <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized The Outer Worlds 2</a>, adding that Obsidian hasn't successfully innovated since the days of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>
