			<p>A complete overhaul of the Nintendo Switch digital game system will come next month with the launch of the Virtual Game Cards system.</p>
<p>Revealed during today's Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new system</a>, which will launch in April and will be fully compatible with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, will completely change the way digital game purchases are handled across different systems. Upon purchasing a digital game via the eShop, the game will be loaded onto the console as a Virtual Game Card, which can be virtually ejected from one console and inserted into another to allow the same digital game to be used on different systems. Games on a single Virtual Game Card can also be arranged between consoles and can even be lent to be used with other Nintendo Accounts that are part of a family group by transferring games between consoles using a local connection. These games will be playable for two weeks before being returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>As the new Virtual Game Cards system will be fully compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be interesting to see if it will impact how the console will handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward-compatible digital games</a>. More information on the matter is likely to come next week during the long-anticipated Nintendo Direct focused on the system.</p>

			<p>New Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the next entry in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwAhBxakw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new footage</a>, shown during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, shows Samus Aran as she lands on Planet Viewros and takes on the many challenges she will find on her journey using mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, such as scanning. The new footage also provided a new look at combat, showing Samus fighting against multiple alien creatures.</p>
<p>The new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage also introduced new abilities called Psychic Abilities, which promise to spice up the series' experience considerably. Thanks to these abilities, Samus can operate mechanisms, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams using the power of her mind. The footage doesn't show a lot of these abilities and their usage, but the possibilities look rather intriguing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage didn't confirm the game's release date, which is still scheduled for a generic 2025 release window. With the Nintendo Switch 2 launching this year with full backward compatibility, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game launch alongside the next-generation Nintendo console.</p>
