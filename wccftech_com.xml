			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build a Rocket Boy which launched this week on PC and consoles, is another Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can only hit 60 FPS at 4K resolution using NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation on one of the most powerful GPUs on the market.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> takes a look at how the game developed by the studio founded by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies runs on an RTX 5080 at 4K and 1440p resolution, two resolutions the GPU should be able to handle well in most titles. Unfortunately, the game is another Unreal Engine 5 GPU destroyer, as, at 4K resolution, MindsEye barely hits the 60 FPS mark only with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode and Frame Generation, and it's only with Multi Frame Generation that a sort of high refresh rate experience is achievable at that resolution. Things fare only marginally better at 1440p resolution, but seeing the game running only at around the 60 FPS mark at native resolution suggests how no other GPU on the market besides the beast that is the RTX 5090 can properly handle the game in its current state.</p>

<p>No one who followed MindsEye until its release should be surprised to see that the game is launching with plenty of issues. Right before launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two Build a Rocket Boy chief executives left the studio</a>, and it was widely reported by those who got early copies on consoles that the game was in a very rough state, which the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">major day one patch</a> improves only marginally.</p>
<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>It will be a while until the doors of the Nintendo Switch 2 are open to actual mods and homebrew software, but even so, it's already possible to mod certain backward-compatible titles to run at max graphics settings and increased framerate.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> showcases Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation running with graphics mods. The first game runs at 60 FPS in Quality Mode at 1080p resolution without dynamic resolution scaling, MSAA x8, Anisotropic Filtering 16x, maxed graphics settings, and a performance overlay that highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the racing game with maxed out settings. Alien Isolation, on the other hand, runs at 1080p resolution with disabled dynamic resolution scaling and all graphics settings maxed. Unfortunately, the framerate cap couldn't be disabled with the method used by the modder, which involves importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed, something that can be done with all games by Feral Interactive, as they all seem to do the same.</p>
<p><iframe title="Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60FPS Unlock / Max Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCVzZTDxdJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 being so popular, having already become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">Nintendo's fastest-selling system to date at launch</a>, it's not surprising to see people already tinkering with the system to discover what can be done outside of what the manufacturer intended. With overclocking and increased RAM, the original system could run <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">demanding games at higher resolutions and more stable framerates</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if something similar can be achieved on the new generation system once modders get full access to it, which is something that will inevitably happen, no matter how much Nintendo will try to prevent it.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now out worldwide, with a few exceptions. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days on the market. The news <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> from Nintendo itself, which also confirmed that the Switch 2 is now its fastest-selling console ever when considering this timeframe.</p>
<p>This early result certainly won't surprise industry analysts, who have been forecasting that the Nintendo Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever in gaming history. DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that 15 million units could be sold by the end of this year, and that was with the looming shadow of Trump's tariffs. Without that, DFC Intelligence reckoned it could reach 17 million units.</p>
<p>Of course, any console's track record is a marathon rather than a sprint, but the new hardware certainly started off strong. Reception has also been very positive so far. On Wccftech, Chris Wray praised the new system in many ways in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, I thoroughly recommend the Switch 2. Like the Switch, it's a great console with a mixture of handheld and regular. This feels sturdier, and the quality of life improvements are far stronger than you may think when simply reading about them. Still, even though I overwhelmingly recommend the Switch 2, if you already have a Switch, I would probably hold out for an offer, which you likely will need to, and for a few games to pad out the abysmal launch line-up. Then again, I got this the same day as people buying it did, so I know you're going to have to wait because it sold better than stolen gold at the Swiss Bankers Convention.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>

<p>On another note, according to Koei Tecmo, the new console is closer to the Xbox Series S than Sony's PlayStation 4.
