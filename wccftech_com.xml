			<p>Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multiple delays</strong> may have dampened the enthusiasm of some fans, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> fever is growing each day as we get closer to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">November 19 launch</a></strong>, as is the thirst for more information on the game. </p>



<p>While more leaks in the coming months are not entirely out of the question, Take-Two is reportedly going to limit them as much as possible by not<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-digital-only-launch/">releasing physical copies of the game at launch</a></strong>. A sensible choice, considering what some crazed fans have attempted to do in the past.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly, who consistently talks with former Rockstar Games employees, <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2016319221333164304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016319221333164304%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=notebookcheck.com"><strong>commented on the possibility of the sixth entry in the series not launching in retail stores</strong></a>. <em>"GTA 6 is going to be the biggest launch in entertainment history and by a wide margin, nothing will ever come close to it," Kiwi Talkz said. "GTA is a way bigger beast now than it was when GTA 5 launched, and I'd bet all my money that this game would leak early if there are physical discs."</em></p>



<p>Surprisingly enough, the danger of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">copies getting into the hands of players a few days earlier</strong> could not be the real reason why Grand Theft Auto 6 may not hit retail stores at launch. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unfortunately, there are a number of crazy Rockstar fans that would 100% break into retail stores and manufacturing facilities to steal discs, and people on the inside would leak it a</em></span><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s well,"&nbsp;</em>Kiwi Talkz said. </p>



<p>This prediction is wholly justified.<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I have heard stories from Rockstar devs over the years of nutty fans trying to get into their buildings to get any info they can from faking IDs to flying drones above windows to try to get images/video,"</em> Kiwi Talkz added. Talk about emulating your favorite video game characters!</p>



<p>As <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"people are breaking into card stores to steal Pokémon Cards because of the hype and demand"</em>, as X user <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Phischer/status/2016334510795981108"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Phischer Stanley highlighted,</strong></a> it really wouldn't be surprising to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">crazed fans pull an illegal stunt</strong> to get that coveted early look at <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. And it wouldn't even be unprecedented either: back in 2023, some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-leaker-review/">very early copies of Starfield illicitly got into the hands of people</a></strong> who did not hesitate to share more on the game before its launch.</p>



<p>Whether it’s flying drones or faking IDs, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extreme lengths</strong> some fans are willing to go for a glimpse of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> proves that this isn't just a game launch. If Take-Two does indeed go with a digital-first strategy, it could mark a historic turning point for the industry, indicating that the risk of leaks may outweigh the rewards of a retail presence.</p>

			<p>If you've been having trouble trying to play one of <strong>Embark Studios</strong> popular multiplayer titles, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/">The Finals</a></strong>, then you're not alone, as the studio has confirmed via the official ARC Raiders Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-coordinated-ddos-attacks">Eurogamer</a>) that both games are suffering from "<em>extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>."</p>



<p>The game's community manager, <strong>Ossen</strong>, shared the following message earlier on Wednesday, with players in the server to confirm they are aware of the attack and that the studio is currently working to fight it.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>. <em>The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing</em>." </p>



<p>The good news is that the latest update from Ossen, which was shared within the last hour states "<em>We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues</em>." It has not been made clear, however, whether Embark Studios has resolved the issue entirely, so you could still experience issues when trying to log in for either game.</p>



<p>That said, the ARC Raiders Discord server is the only place Embark has addressed the issue, and the lack of a post on any of its other social media channels does seem to indicate that the issue is either close to being resolved, or has been resolved, since the team at Embark doesn't seem to deem it necessary to make players who may not be in the ARC Raiders Discord server aware of the situation.</p>



<p>If you want more signs that things are improving, you can also look to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">the SteamDB concurrent player numbers for ARC Raiders</a>, which did drop to the lowest point the game has seen since it launched, but has since begun to rise back to its usual activity. That said, ARC Raiders' lowest point since launch was still above <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players, proving that not even a DDoS attack can bring the popular extraction shooter below six figures of concurrent players.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Enough is Enough!” Ubisoft Worker Unions Call for Strike in Response to Layoffs and Mandatory RTO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft's</strong> recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> continues to ripple through the video game industry, and now it has led to what was arguably an inevitable point in this story, as French unions representing Ubisoft workers, namely <strong>Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du jeu Vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT</strong>, and <strong>Printemps écologique</strong>, have called for a <strong>strike</strong> in response to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">recent layoffs, studio closures, and the proposed end to remote work policies under a return-to-office mandate</a>. </p>



<p>The strike called by the French unions will be a three-day event, taking place on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12,</strong> with the unions calling for all Ubisoft workers worldwide to join them in the demonstration. It's also not the only demonstration planned, as the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mdggnk5yos26">set to hold a rally in Halifax this coming <strong>Thursday, January 29, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> in solidarity with the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">who were laid off when Ubisoft shut down its Halifax studio earlier this month</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Enough is enough!</em>" begins a collaborative statement from the STJV and the aforementioned French unions. "<em>Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn't even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th, and 12th</em>."</p>







<p>The statement shared goes on to further call out Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, claiming that he and Ubisoft management are going back on a remote work policy deal that was in place since <strong>September 2025</strong>, and further calls out the company's top brass for not taking responsibility for their actions that have led to this major restructure. A fair point to make, since you might recall that Guillemot and the current Ubisoft leadership led the company to lose <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">95% of its total value in the last eight years</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"<em>We are told about responsibilities,</em> <em>but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management, the latest result being the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">elimination of 200 jobs at Ubisoft's headquarters</a></em>."</p>



<p>Prior to this strike call, earlier this week, French union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">directly called out Guillemot for having "<em>no knowledge or understanding of his company</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ubisoft's "<em>major reset</em>" reorganized the company into five Creative Houses, with its various branching studios across the world put into at least one of the five houses, if they survived the restructure. Ubisoft claims the Halifax and Stockholm studio shutdowns were part of this restructure, as were layoffs announced last year at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>. We also know that the restructure is responsible for pushing out senior veteran talent at Ubisoft, with the company losing its lead on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Assassin's Creed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">The Division</a></strong>. The former is <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">even suing Ubisoft for "<em>constructive dismissal</em>."</a></p>



<p>The reset also saw six projects get cancelled, including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> and seven more delayed, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>. In all of this mess, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/"><strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> survived</a>, and is still in production, according to Ubisoft.</p>



<p>It's still early days as to how the dust will settle with this restructure. While French unions put pressure on Ubisoft in the company's home country, the CWA Canada <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">continues to apply pressure to the Nova Scotia government and the Canadian public to carefully scrutinize the closure of the Halifax studio,</a> pressure that has already resulted in Ubisoft reconsidering the severance package it would offer workers. The union has also <a href="https://ubisoftworkerscanada.com/">kicked off a letter-writing campaign and published a timeline outlining why it believes the closure to be suspect</a>, as the Nova Scotia Labour Board investigates.</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Wccftech for further reporting on the situation at Ubisoft as it develops.</p>
