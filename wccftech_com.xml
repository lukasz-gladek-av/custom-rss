			<p>A few months later than expected, Sony shared an official PlayStation 5 Pro teardown to provide a better look at the system's cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The teardown covers pretty much every aspect of the system, starting with its design that sets it apart from the original PS5 model and its slimmer revision featuring a "louver" sitting between the main unit and the cover, which makes the console quieter. The rear design has also been changed for more efficient airflow over the other PS5 models.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's official teardown obviously also provides a great look at the system's internals, which highlights the new fan designed to generate airflow more efficiently, which features the same number of blades of the regular PS5 fan, the strategically placed high number of screws to reduce electromagnetic interference, the large motherboard made of more internal layers than the base PS5's motherboard to achieve faster memory performance, the added DDR5 memory chip, and the innovative use of liquid metal, whose usage in the base PS5 proved to be the right choice, as liquid metal technology was integral when designing the PS5 Pro. All of this, and more, can be found explained in greater detail on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/21/playstation-5-pro-teardown-an-inside-look-at-the-most-advanced-playstation-console-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launched worldwide in November. It is currently the most powerful system on the market, allowing for advanced visual features not available on other systems, as seen in the recently released<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-resolution-new-comparison-highlights-how-xbox-series-x-closer-ps5-pro/"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

			<p>The biggest challenge The Witcher IV will face is convincing players that Ciri is just as important as the iconic Geralt of Rivia, if not even more, and to present this fact convincingly, according to the game's Cinematic Animation Director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@G4G_Revenant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenant</a>, David Cordero, who also worked as the Cinematic Animation Director for Cyberpunk 2077, commented on the challenges the next entry in the series will face coming after one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time, saying that the biggest will be convincing players that Ciri is just as important as Geralt, if not even more. This, according to Cordero, will be the hardest part, as Geralt is a really charismatic character that has already appeared in multiple games, whereas Ciri has only appeared in The Witcher 3. The rest, on the other hand, is not going to be difficult, as the studio is going all in for gameplay and combat, and is constantly listening to players' feedback.</p>
<p>To present Ciri in the proper way in The Witcher IV, the development team is leveraging the lore department that was formed during the development of the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty expansion, and will focus on showing what's actually happening and not just on showing why Ciri is a proper witcher. The lore department will also make sure that every little detail fits properly into the game's world.</p>
<p>Speaking about the narrative elements in The Witcher IV, CDPR's Cinematic Animation Director revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be a point of reference for the game, as CDPR did some outstanding work on the first-person open-world RPG that has, in many ways, surpassed what was done in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="Downgrade #11 CD Projekt | Dev Español cuenta cómo se hizo Cyberpunk y el futuro de The Witcher 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlelBwxBax8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Being as much a The Witcher nerd as those in CDPR's lore department, I can only concur with David Cordero's statement, as Ciri plays an extremely important role in the books written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The best thing about the novels, however, is how Ciri's importance is balanced with Geralt and Yennefer's importance, so hopefully, the development team will be able to strike a similar balance in their highly anticipated game that is not launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">until 2027</a>.</p>

			<p>NEXON has shared several updates on their upcoming co-op action RPG Vindictus: Defying Fate. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vindictus-defying-fate-is-a-new-upcoming-action-rpg-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in February 2024, the game is based on the fantasy IP of the popular free-to-play MMORPG. Following last year's Pre-Alpha Test, the developers have now scheduled a PC (Steam) Alpha Test for June. They have also shared the content that will be available for testing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>4 playable characters</li>
<li>Companion system: NPC companions that assist in combat</li>
<li>Combat: Single-player or multiplayer, depending on the content</li>
<li>Story and cutscenes: Includes Alpha Test version NPCs and story-related cutscenes</li>
<li>Growth system: Leveling, weapon crafting, Ability system, and more</li>
<li>Village and inventory system</li>
<li>Select cosmetic items</li>
<li>And more diverse content will also be available during the test</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>NEXON also talked about some of the improvements made to Vindictus: Defying Fate following the Pre-Alpha feedback. Characters will now be able to climb ladders and ride ziplines to reach certain places, as well as use grappling hooks to navigate the environment more quickly. Traps have also been introduced to make the experience more engaging.</p>
<p>Of course, combat remains the core aspect of the game. NEXON has added a so-called Special Action that can only be executed with precise timing. When performed successfully, it either triggers a Perfect Guard, blocking the attack entirely, or a Perfect Dodge, which flows into a powerful counterattack, depending on the character picked.</p>
<p>When a foe is staggered, players can execute a Fatal Action. This works by attacking the enemy, building up a stagger gauge. When that gauge is full, the enemy loses its stance for a brief moment, allowing players the opportunity to perform the Fatal Action and take it down. All the&nbsp;playable characters in the upcoming Alpha Test (Lann, Fiona, Karok, and Delia) will be equipped with a unique Fatal Action that is tailor-made for their combat style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bjI40EMe5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just yesterday, NEXON released a new character trailer for Delia. You can watch it embedded right above. Vindictus: Defying Fate doesn't have a release date yet; it will launch on PC as well as consoles, although the console version may come out at a later date.</p>

			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frantic few weeks of rumors</a>, the announcement day for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster has arrived. Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a dedicated stream will air today on Twitch and YouTube starting at 11 AM Eastern Time/8 AM Pacific Time/4 PM British Time.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the game should be shadowdropped, meaning that it should also be released right after the stream. Meanwhile, we have uncovered some details about the developer's design philosophy for this project. Bethesda picked Singaporean game developer Virtuos to aid them in this remaster. The studio previously worked on the Nintendo Switch port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NieR Automata: End of Yorha Edition</a> and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition</a>, while also collaborating on major triple-A projects like Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Island 2, Horizon Forbidden West - Complete Edition, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>Last year, game development website 80Lv <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Virtuos specifically about their work on remasters and ports. During the interview, Design Director Nicolas Roginski shared a reply that, in hindsight, cannot have been referencing anything other than the Oblivion Remaster:</p>
<p><em>We are working on a very big, unannounced project. Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It’s challenging, mainly because of players’ perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won’t match the “feeling” of their memories.</em></p>
<p><em>To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the “feeling of the memory”, not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is “Keep, Improve, Create”:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keep what is core to the original vision and core memories players have of the original game.</em></li>
<li><em>Improve what you need to modernize because standards have evolved.</em></li>
<li><em>Create in the sense of what needs to be removed or added to surprise the player, and set a new standard for the genre, which has evolved over the years</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtuos is also working alongside Konami on another very big project, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, the interview was published in March 2024, while MGS Delta: Snake Eater had been announced in May 2023 and was in fact already referenced in the 80Lv article. As such, it's almost guaranteed that Roginski had to have been referring to the Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>The idea of recreating the feeling of the memory is definitely the right one, at least on paper. However, executing that concept is undoubtedly harder than simply adopting it. The return of The Elder Scrolls IV is sure to induce a lot of nostalgia in a lot of people, but only a quality product can make it resurface with positive feelings.</p>
<p>We likely won't have to wait long to judge it all first-hand. Are you excited? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-pc-update-detailed-by-bend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming later this week for PlayStation 5, but PC users will also be able to access the same content and features. When it comes to new modes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horde Assault</a>, Permadeath Mode, and Speedrun Mode will have to be purchased as part of the $10 Broken Road DLC. However, the tech improvements will be released for free with Update 1.08, and Bend has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1259420/view/520837042930712856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full details for the patch:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DualSense haptic feedback support</em></li>
<li><em>Accessibility features</em></li>
<li><em>World graphical improvements</em></li>
<li><em>New Atmospheric/Sky simulation using ozone and spectral light simulation: Improves overall color tone and produces more accurate light intensities for the sky and sunlight</em></li>
<li><em>Significantly darker night time</em></li>
<li><em>Improved screen space indirect lighting and ambient occlusion effects</em></li>
<li><em>Double shadowmap resolution when Shadow Quality is set to Highest</em></li>
<li><em>Additional improvements</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Days Gone was very&nbsp;<span>good-looking for an Unreal Engine 4 open-world game launched in 2019 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-q-we-were-blown-away-by-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 for PC</a>), but it's been a while, and these enhancements are undoubtedly welcome. Hopefully, alongside the new modes, they'll help shine an even greater light on this entirely underrated game. Unfortunately, Sony has&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nixed the pitch for a sequel</a> and</span>&nbsp;also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Bend's next project earlier this year. Perhaps, if Days Gone Remastered does well enough, they might reconsider the prospects of a sequel. I, for one, certainly appreciated the original game. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Days Gone puts Bend Studio once again on the map of all PlayStation gamers after many years of oblivion. While it doesn't deliver any meaningful innovations in terms of open world and gameplay mechanics, it's a fun game that sports gorgeous graphics and a surprisingly great story/cast of characters.</em></p>
<p>Days Gone Remastered will be available on Thursday, April 25.</p>
