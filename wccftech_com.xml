			<p>Marvel Rivals' next update, Season 4.5, launches next week on October 10, 2025, adding Daredevil to the roster as a new duelist. Beyond a new character, next week's update will add the beginnings of a highly requested feature: cross-platform progression support. The catch, unfortunately, is that it'll only be live for players invited to try it out, while everyone else will have to wait for cross-progression support to be available to all players with Season 5's launch.</p>



<p>As is routine with every major Marvel Rivals season update, developer NetEase has debuted two new videos. The first is a gameplay trailer showing off Daredevil gameplay and each of his skill and abilities in action. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The second is a Dev Vision video featuring the game's creative director, Guangguang, going over the key changes in the coming season, including being able to customize the background of your home screen, and how cross-platform progression will work once it's live for all users.</p>



<p>You'll be able to access a main character across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, though your statistics and rankings will be separate for each platform. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Guangguang also teased that a new mode is going to be added to the game, with details set to premiere on October 17, and that the team is preparing a Halloween event with new cosmetics for various characters on the Marvel Rivals roster.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals' fourth season has seen some major changes, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">the addition of a PlayStation 4 version of the game</a> and the introduction of cross-platform progression. However, a bigger, and likely more controversial change is still to come, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals/">rumours still loom that loot boxes will be added to the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard invited various content creators and press members, Wccftech included, to get a brief taste of the World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha before it goes live tomorrow. In this short period of time, we were able to capture some footage of Silvermoon City and the new Housing feature, arguably two of the standout features of the upcoming expansion.</p>



<p>We also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw&amp;pp=ygURd29ybGQgb2Ygd2FyY3JhZnQ%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Dive presentation</a> in advance. This 30-minute video reveals many new details about World of Warcraft: Midnight; here's a summary of what the developers explained about the second chapter in the Worldsoul Saga.</p>



<p>The arrival of the Voidstorm—a swirling vortex of shadow—heralds the return of Xal’atath, the big bad enemy introduced in The War Within, now wielding the Dark Heart. Her goal is simple and rather scary: to devour the heavens and extinguish all light in the universe. The expansion centers on a desperate defense of the Sunwell, led by Lady Liadrin and Lor’themar Theron (and, of course, the players), as the forces of Light and Void clash in a battle that is more reckoning than war.</p>



<p>The Blood Elf capital of Silvermoon City has been reimagined as a shared hub for Horde and Alliance. It's also, at last, a city fully renewed by the Sunwell's light. Landmarks that Horde players have are familiar with now shine renewed, but there are also brand new areas like the Sanctum of Light and Garden of Remembrance, which offer fresh lore and exploration. The shared space includes trainers, vendors, and more. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As we were told in our Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, a third of Silvermoon City remains exclusive to the Horde, and Alliance players must remember not to get too close or they may be attacked.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - New Silvermoon City Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrmzYU1rbYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Because of the Sunwell's healing outburst, the Eversong Woods, once scarred by the Scourge campaign led by Arthas Menethil on his way to become the Lich King, are now teeming with life. Eversong Woods has also been merged with the Ghostlands into a seamless, expanded zone connected to the Eastern Kingdoms. The healing energy might have revitalized the land, but it also inadvertently caused a mysterious and dangerous overgrowth known as lightbloom, which, if left unchecked, could cover the whole zone in a jungle-like environment. Quests include solving noble feuds, investigating suspicious apothecaries, and unraveling a murder mystery with Magister Umbric.</p>



<p>After they're done with this first region, players will be able to progress in World of Warcraft: Midnight in any order of their choosing. There are three main options: Zul’Aman, Harandar, or a continent-spanning storytelling experience with Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner. Once those main stories are completed, the paths converge as heroes make their way into the Voidstorm itself to face Xal’atath’s fiercest allies.</p>



<p>The fallen Amani empire seeks redemption in Zul’Aman (once a 10-man PvE raid). Players join Zul’jarra, granddaughter of Zul’jin, to reclaim sacred temples and fight deranged Void cultists. This region features fog-shrouded ruins, stormy wilds, and sky-scraping peaks. Helping the Trolls means they will, in return, aid the Sunwell's defense.<br>Harandar, a primordial jungle deep within Azeroth, is where the roots of the World Tree converge. This region is home to the Haranir, already seen in the previous expansion. They are a reclusive race now forced to join the surface war against Xal’atath. Harandar features fungal towers, moss bridges, and the Cradle—a sacred site once ruled by a nascent goddess, now vanished. The Haranir are also the next playable allied race; their racial abilities include the ability to fast-travel via the World Tree roots. Haranir characters can be Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Priests, Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Monks, and Druids (with unique forms reflecting their jungle origins).</p>



<p>As for Arator’s journey, it follows the son of High Exarch Turalyon and Void Elf Ranger Alleria Windrunner on a continent-spanning quest to search for sacred relics and strengthen the Light. Featured encounters include defending Light's Hope Chapel, cleansing Scarlet Monastery, and ultimately confronting his legacy with the Sons of Lothar at Blackrock Mountain, all of which are iconic places vanilla World of Warcraft players will recognize.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, there is the Voidstorm, a chaotic, gravity-defying zone filled with ancient Void creatures called Domanaar. Here, three huge Nexus Points fuel Xal’atath's power. Players must uncover the storm's secrets alongside the Void Elves and other champions from Azeroth.</p>



<p>When it comes to launch content, World of Warcraft: Midnight offers over ten Delves, including Parhelion Plaza (located in the Isle of Quel'Danas), Collegiate Calamity, and Shadowguard Point, and one seasonal Nemesis Delve. Each Delve has its own unique mechanics, like commanding Light artillery or navigating pocket dimensions. The War Within's Brann Bronzebeard will take a break this time so that players will be joined by a new Delve companion: Valeera Sanguinar. Like Brann, her abilities differ depending on her player-selected role of tank, DPS, or healer. When set to DPS, her Killing Spree skill damages multiple enemies at once as Valeera phases in and out of the shadows. As a healer, her Vampiric Reaping extracts the enemies' life force in the form of orbs that the players can collect to get healed. As a tank, she has an ability called 'Your First Mistake' that taunts and deals damage over time to ensure an enemy is focused on her rather than the players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The expansion also includes eight new group dungeons, such as Windrunner Spire, Magister’s Terrace, Murder Row, The Den of Nalorakk, Maisara Caverns, Blinding Vale, Voidscar Arena, and Nexus-Point Xenas. Windrunner Spire, located on the Western shore of Eversoong Woods, explores the haunted legacy of the Windrunner family. Players will have to help Lirath, the only brother to the more famous Winderunner sisters; he's a spirit who just wants his home to be free of the many restless spirits that now call it home. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight's endgame includes three raids at launch: Voidspire, the heart of Xal’atath's power, guarded by six fearsome bosses; the Dreamrift, where players will hunt an undreamt god that never should have been, and the March on Quel’danas, where players will face Belo’ren, a Void-corrupted phoenix, in this two-boss raid. </p>



<p>The expansion also adds the Prey System, an opt-in bounty hunting system led by Astalor Bloodsworn in Silvermoon City's Murder Row. Players will hunt targets like Magister Sunbreaker, High Vindicator Vureem, and Executor Kaenius, picking between three difficulty tiers: Normal, Hard, Nightmare. Higher difficulties incorporate torments to add personal afflictions like time-limited kills or lethal spirits.</p>



<p>One of the brand new things revealed today is the Arcantina, a cozy, cross-faction tavern serving as a quest hub and social space. It offers respite from the war against the Void and even access to new adventures. Blizzard said familiar characters would show up, giving quests that will send players worldwide to search for relics from the long-forgotten past.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - Housing and Neighborhood Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WrAC7_Syo_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The long-awaited Housing system will allow players full customization with interiors and exteriors. Architectural styles available at launch include Orc, Human, Blood Elf, and Night Elf. An Advanced editing mode allows rotation, scaling, and floating of décor, and many housing items can be dyed to achieve the desired look. More Housing rewards are tied to many facets of core gameplay, including achievements (even from past content exploits), crafting, vendors, and events. What's particularly interesting is that players can choose to either join a public Neighborhood or a private Neighborhood. The latter are also further split into Guild Neighborhoods, which scale to fit the Guild roster, and Charter Neighboorhods, which cap at 50 homes. The developers have even prepared Neighborhood-wide monthly Endeavors that can unlock themed decorations and community rewards. Early access to the Housing system will start on December 2 for those users who pre-ordered the expansion.</p>



<p>Demon Hunters will be able to select a new spec, Devourer, a Void-powered mid-range DPS with a summonable Void Scythe. Their abilities include Voidblade, Hungering Slash, Void Ray, and Collapsing Star. Metamorphosis and Reap mechanics allow for high burst damage. In addition, Void Elves can now be Demon Hunters, too.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight will also update the MMORPG with several quality of life, Player versus Player and user interface enhancements, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li>Transmog overhauled with slot-based looks and auto outfit swapping.</li>



<li>Apex Talents: powerful multi-point capstones in the talent trees.</li>



<li>PvP additions: Slayer’s Rise (an instanced epic battleground inspired by others like Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest) and an open world PVP area) and Training Grounds (formerly known as the brawl “Comp Stomp,” now a permanent fixture to PVP battlegrounds with Silvershard Mines and Battle for Gilneas available).</li>



<li>New player experience enhancements: fast-track to Dragonflight and lorewalking.</li>



<li>Combat assistant, cooldown manager, profession streamlining, and more.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Blizzard revealed that a physical Collector's Edition of World of Warcraft: Midnight can now be pre-ordered <a href="https://fave.co/43136dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. It features an art book, a collectible pin, a replica of the Dark Heart, and the Epic edition of the game and all its digital bonuses.</p>



<p>Renowned leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that the expansion will go live on February 26, 2026, although Blizzard did not comment on the leak and remains on a generic 2026 release window.</p>
