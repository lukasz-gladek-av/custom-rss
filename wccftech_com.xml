			<p>As NVIDIA's cloud service <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-turns-six-users-streamed-over-1b-hours-to-date/"><strong>GeForce NOW</strong> celebrates its sixth anniversary</a>, with a new batch of games set to join the service, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nioh-3-vampires-bloodlord-rising-carmageddon-dlss/">a new batch of games are also getting support</a> for <strong>NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation</strong>, including the critically acclaimed Masocore from <strong>Team Ninja</strong> that will arrive on PC and PS5 tomorrow, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/">Nioh 3</a>.</strong></p>



<p>While the full game won't be available until tomorrow, <strong>February 6, 2026,</strong> if you haven't already, you can download the Nioh 3 demo to get yourself prepared for the full release. The demo and the full game both support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation. </p>
