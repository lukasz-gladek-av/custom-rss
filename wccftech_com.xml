			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard received strong reviews (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own</a>), but it failed to meet publisher Electronic Arts's sales expectations. This resulted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job cuts at developer BioWare</a>, which now <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly has under a hundred staff members</a>, a worrying prospect for their upcoming Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Q3 2025 earnings call, Electronic Arts finally&nbsp;<span>discussed the launch's commercial failure. In a statement (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/electronic-arts-ea-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript via Fool.com</a>), CEO Andrew Wilson outlined that it was a high-quality game that</span>&nbsp;failed to captivate a large audience, partly because players 'increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement.'</p>
<p><em>Our blockbuster storytelling strategy is built on three strategic objectives: first, create an authentic story experience for the core audience; second, build innovative groundbreaking features; and third, emphasize high-quality launches across both PC and console. In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demand of players who increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category. Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.</em></p>
<p>Later in the earnings call, Stuart Canfield, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Electronic Arts, added:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed, highlighting the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market. [...] Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players. The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources toward our most significant and highest potential opportunities.</em></p>
<p>The latter sentence is certainly worrying for fans of blockbuster single player games. It sounds like Electronic Arts might once again veer toward live service, and their previous attempts (like Anthem) were far from memorable. Still, the studio does have at least three single player games in production: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Man game</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther game</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi series</a>.</p>

			<p>There were some major announcements today during the Capcom Spotlight broadcasts, which was then followed by a Monster Hunter Wilds showcase that unveiled even more details about the upcoming game and what players can expect. It was also announced that there will be a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Open Beta Test</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds later this month, where those who participate will be able to challenge Arkveld, as well as the opportunity to hunt the "White Wraith." There are some returning monsters, too. However, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn't the only thing that Capcom showed off during these showcases.</p>
<p>New details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> have been announced, as Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Director Satoru Nihei joined the show to give fans more details about the story. The title follows the story of a new protagonist who is wielding the Oni Gauntlet, and will have to fight off the demonic Genma. This title is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam in 2026.</p>
<p>Not only were there details for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, but it's also been confirmed that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is receiving a remaster and is currently in development. Fans got a sneak peek of this 2002 title with enhanced graphics during the Capcom Spotlight with a trailer. The title will be coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.</p>

<p>As of today, MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is now available via a digital download on Xbox One, where you can also purchase the game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>For more Capcom fighting goodness, it's been announced that the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will be available as both a physical and digital title on May 16, with pre-orders for this game being available as of today. This collection will include titles like Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 and Power Stone 2. There will be new features to help bring the games back to life, as well as online play with rollback netcode. In total, there are eight games in this package for you to play through.</p>
<p>On a slightly smaller note, Mai officially joins Street Fighter 6 tomorrow, so make sure to dust off your controllers and hitboxes as you learn Mai's combos and abilities on the streets. She will be the third Year 2 character for Street Fighter 6, with Elena being the last to join the roster. Additionally, the Street Fighter Capcom Cup event will be returning from March 5-9, 2025, with a grand prize of $1 million.</p>
