			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the GreatðŸ–•) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>â€” Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>
