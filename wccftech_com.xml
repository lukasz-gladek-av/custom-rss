			<p>For fans of Age of Empires, today's announcement is going to feel like a massive celebration. The developers of Age of Empires have shared that there will be new content coming to multiple games, as well as their exciting announcement of reaching 60 million Age of Empire players worldwide.</p>
<p>Diving into the updates one by one, PlayStation 5 fans are in luck. Both Age of Mythology: Retold and <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-might-be-coming-to-playstation/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> will be making their way to PlayStation. Age of Mythology: Retold will be launching on PlayStation 5 in correlation with the Immortal Pillars expansion being released on March 4. This expansion will introduce the Chinese pantheon, as well as new maps to explore, myth units, and added gameplay features. For those who want to get their hands on this expansion, pre-orders are now live. Those who own Age of Mythology: Retold - Premium Edition will automatically receive the expansion on day one.</p>
<p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition will launch on PlayStation 5 later in the Spring. When both titles are released, they will feature content parity across all platforms, as well as cross-play support. This title is currently available on Xbox Game Pass and Steam.</p>
<p>In addition to these two games being released for PlayStation, it's been confirmed by the developers that new content will be released for Age of Empires IV this year. It will receive two pieces of DLC in 2025, with the first one launching this Spring. The first DLC will be titled "Knights of Cross and Rose" and will give players the opportunity to lead two well-known armies that are inspired by history. It will also introduce a new solo. More information regarding the second DLC will be shared at a later date, most likely once the first DLC has been released.</p>
<p>For those who play Age of Empires Mobile, February will be a big month for you. There are new features and events to participate in, including a new campaign named Battle of Dawn, as well as a new event named Stellar Glory. For Valentine's Day, Age of Empires Mobile will be getting exclusive Valentine's Day cosmetics, as well as three events to participate in that are themed around Princess Josephine's Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p>More information and screenshots are available on the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Age of Empires website</a>, so you can see what the game will look like with the introduction of the new content in all games.

			<p>The sports game that everyone has been waiting for is finally going into Early Access on PC on March 20, 2025. Wreckfest 2, a title that will have extreme full-contact racing and chaos, will be bigger and better than ever. The developers stated that the physics engine has been significantly overhauled so that the crashes are more intense than ever and deeper component damage. Of course, there will be the iconic mayhem of the races that everyone loves, but now it's even more detailed than before. This title was one of the most highly anticipated racing and sports games in<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/"> our 2025 round-up</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what they can expect from Wreckfest 2's Early Access period, make sure to check out the trailer below to see some of the adrenaline rushes you can experience in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>High-speed circuits make a return, and you'll even get to race and crash through a junkyard, which can make for some intense collisions. More than that, you'll also get to try and attempt some serious jumps, which can help you get ahead of the opponent while weaving through oncoming traffic at busy intersections. Compared to other racing games, Wreckfest 2 is a game where no rules apply, and it's every driver for themselves. You will be racing against up to 23 other players or AI drivers, depending on what you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Instead of sparkly supercars to race through the tracks, the cars you choose will be patchwork jobs full of dents, rust, and broken parts to really add to the grime and grittiness of Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>Early Access will continue to progress and add new content, and during this time, you'll be able to build your very own car from the ground up and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. There will be new cars added to the game, as well as other vehicles to come in the future as the game continues to develop and evolve.</p>
<p>Consumer feedback is essential to the developers during the Early Access period and will all be taken on board so that it can be refined and reshaped as needed during Early Access.</p>
<p>For those on PC and want to get stuck into Wreckfest 2, make sure to wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> so you'll be notified when the game officially enters the Early Access period on PC.</p>
