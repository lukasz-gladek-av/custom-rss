			<p>There's no denying that Battlefield 6 has had a massive launch, one week into the game being on shelves. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">amidst issues for PC players</a> and progression frustration, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">EA and Battlefield Studios have acted quickly to address</a>, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">officially sold over 7 million units in its first three days</a>, making it the biggest franchise launch ever, according to EA. On top of that, a new GSD data sales report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger">The Game Business</a> reveals it's already won a point against its ongoing and rejuvenized battle with Call of Duty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/data-key-facts/games-sales-data/">Game Sales Data (GSD)</a> under Video Games Europe tracks software units sold for both retail and digital sales in regions across the EU, Africa, and Australia, and in its latest report for sales from October 5-12, it shows that Battlefield 6 was at the top of the charts for unit sales and revenue per GSD's tracking, with the latest entry in the long-running shooter achieving four times the launch sales of Battlefield V, and beating out the EU launch sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As The Game Business points out, last year's Call of Duty was the first one to be available day one to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, which does skew the launch numbers from that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">a year when Call of Duty was not available on a subscription service</a>. </p>



<p>That said, with Xbox seemingly committed to having Call of Duty as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">part of the list of premium releases Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get</a>, especially since Xbox needs something to try and convince people Ultimate is worth $30 a month, Call of Duty available through Game Pass right away seems to be the new normal.</p>



<p>That's all to say that this is still a sign of just how successful of a launch Battlefield 6 is having, especially if it's already showing it can best the current standard of Call of Duty releases on the commercial charts. Of course, the launch of Black Ops 7 will be a greater test, since, realistically, there could be a chunk of Battlefield 6 players who've bought in just to get their fix until Black Ops 7 launches. Combined with the players who don't buy anything every year except for the new Call of Duty game, it's very possible that Battlefield 6 falls short of Call of Duty in terms of sales.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GSD charts, EA (the publisher) held on to the number one and two spots in the units sold and revenue charts, with Battlefield 6 in first and EA Sports FC 26 in second. Behind it was PlayStation's Ghost of Yotei, followed by Little Nightmares III, for both charts. </p>



<p>It's only in the fifth position that the units sold and revenue earned charts differ, with Red Dead Redemption 2 making the units sold charts fifth place, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 making the revenue charts. However, specifically with Super Mario Galaxy, it's worth noting that digital sales numbers for Nintendo games are not available, since Nintendo only shares physical numbers.</p>



<p>Here's the full top 10 list for GSD's units sold and revenue charts, per The Game Business.</p>

			<p>Publisher 505 Games and developer Supernova Games Studios, alongside a technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni, have announced a new branch of the Assetto Corsa series with Assetto Corsa Rally, a new rally racing game to expand on the sim racing already established in other Assetto Corsa games. It'll arrive on PC first with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Early Access release on Steam</a> set for this coming November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll be the second Assetto Corsa release this year, after Assetto Corsa EVO <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/">launched on January 16, 2025, also in early access</a>. It's also still in early access, with the last word on its 1.0 release being Fall 2025. That said, we're more than halfway through October at the time of this writing, and there's no official update.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer went alongside the announcement for Assetto Corsa Rally, which included short clips of in-game footage showcasing how Assetto Corsa is approaching rally racing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1_7q_gHrTo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally has been built with an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine, which was tuned to better suit rally-style racing with uneven surfaces, jumps, more variable road conditions, a dynamic weather system, and more realistic vehicle behaviour across all the new variables and terrains found in rally racing.</p>



<p>In a press release, Supernova Games Studios specifically calls out the use of "<em>laser scan technology for every stage in each rally event, enabling accurate reproduction of real-world terrain formations, road surface irregularities and characteristics, and details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the physics engine built by KUNOS Simulazioni, Supernova Game Studios is developing Assetto Corsa Rally using Unreal Engine 5, to ensure "<em>high fidelity and performance</em>."</p>



<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches in early access next month, it'll include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>33km&nbsp;of fully laserscanned&nbsp;real-life roads.</em></li>



<li><em>4 Special Stages&nbsp;with&nbsp;18 variants, set across gravel roads in&nbsp;Wales&nbsp;and tarmac roads in&nbsp;Alsace</em>.</li>



<li><em>10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles</em>.</li>



<li><em>5 game modes, triple screen support, and more</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The full 1.0 version of the game will add six more special stages, a full 30 vehicle roster, new game modes including a career mode, a rally school mode, and VR support. For now, there's no inclination as to when v1.0 is expected to be ready.</p>



<p>"<em>Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we've built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts,</em>" Supernova Game Studios director, Maura Notarberardino, said. "<em>A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series, especially in terms of the driving model, in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can't wait to share the journey with you</em>."</p>



<p>KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder Marco Massarutto also added that a rally racing simulator in the Assetto Corsa series has been heavily requested by fans for years, and also shed some light as to why it took the series as long as it did to take this new step.</p>



<p>"<em>A proper rally simulation requires a dedicated approach that can leverage the unique aspects of this motorsports discipline,</em>" he began. "<em>Racing primarily against the chronometer, rather than against dozens of real-time processed AI opponents, frees up noticeable CPU resources, and this allows developers to push the boundaries of physics, as well as mechanical behaviour and tire models, across different surfaces that Assetto Corsa Rally will feature and simulate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The result is a dedicated and genuine rally simulation, powered by the Assetto Corsa physics engine, that can fully exploit its potential without compromise. Combining this advanced engine with some of the best real rally stages reproduced using laser-scan technology, the most iconic rally cars, adding up on the passion and competence of the Supernova dev-team, will allow to deliver an ultimate experience that fans have been anticipating for decades</em>."</p>



<p>Notarberardino is not entirely wrong to point out that there's a gap in the racing game genre when it comes to simulation-style rally racing games. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, and gained the rights to publish WRC games, it was expected that we'd get WRC games each year from 2023 to 2027, but that partnership ended after the release of EA Sports WRC 23. Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">confirmed earlier that it was pausing work on future WRC and rally games</a>, so fans of the more sim-focused WRC series and the less sim, more arcade-y DiRT were both let down.</p>



<p>A month after Codemasters' announcement, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/">Nacon was taking back control of making WRC-licensed games</a>, but because they're just starting up again, we still have some time before Nacon is ready to release a new WRC title.</p>



<p>Which means that when Assetto Corsa Rally hits PC in November, it'll be something new for rally fans, specifically simulation-focused rally racing fans, to dig their tires into. We'll see how it fares and how Assetto Corsa does with its first rally racing game.</p>
