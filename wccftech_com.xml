			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition">The Verge</a>, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft over its Activision Blizzard King acquisition. The organization <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">filed a motion to dismiss the case</a> today, May 22, 2025, finally closing the door on the FTC's attempts to block the largest acquisition in video game industry history.</p>
<p>Microsoft first announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King at <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">the beginning of 2022</a>, and by the end of 2022, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-microsoft-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/">FTC had filed a lawsuit against Microsoft</a>, and so began the long contest that has continued to stretch on, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-deal-free-to-proceed-ftc-pause-rejected-ninth-circuit/">after the FTC lost</a> in its one major change to really stop the deal from happening. At the beginning of this month, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost a final attempt</a> at stopping the deal and has chosen to put its fight to rest.</p>
<p>"<em>On May 7, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FTC v. Microsoft Corp...denying the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp,</em>" the filing reads.</p>
<p>"<em>The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed by the Commission</em>."</p>
<p>Vice chair and president of Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">Brad Smith celebrated the dismissa</a>l, saying "<em>Today's decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today's announcement.</em>"</p>
<p>After losing its initial attempt to stop the deal, Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">October 2023</a>, but that didn't stop the FTC from trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-appeal-against-judges-decision-hoping-to-delay-microsofts-closure-of-activision-blizzard-deal/">break it up</a> after the fact. The organization also spoke out against decisions Microsoft has made since the deal closed, like raising the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">laying off thousands of employees.</a></p>

			<p><strong>Update 22/05/2025:</strong> Bandai Namco released a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1925699586640707708">official US X account</a> regarding the Elden Ring movie, saying "<em>We're thrilled to announce that Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. and A24 are teaming up with writer and director Alex Garland to bring FromSoftware Inc.'s world-renowned video game Elden Ring to life as a live-action film.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We're truly excited to bring the world of Elden Ring to fans in a new form, outside the game. Stay tuned. The path ahead is only beginning</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that the previously rumored Elden Ring movie with A24 producing and Alex Garland set to write and direct, is in fact real. No word on when it is happening, but Garland is leading the project with Bandai Namco set to collaborate.</p>
<p>The idea of an Elden Ring movie or TV adaptation has been brought up twice before by George R.R. Martin, who mentioned it <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-is-being-discussed-says-george-r-r-martin/">early last year</a> and then again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/">summer 2024</a>, though there's been no word on whether it was really happening or not.</p>
<p>Weeks prior to Deadline's report, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/">rumor appeared online</a> that it would be Garland writing and directing it and that the movie was happening, but the original source took down their claim that the movie was being made, and that Garland and A24 were behind it.</p>
<p>The original claim's removal led many to speculate that it was a false claim, though Deadline's report today seals that the report last month was correct.</p>
<p>Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R.R. Martin will produce the film. It's unclear when we'll hear about casting and when the film will start shooting, or what it could be about, but the previous rumor claimed that filming would begin in 2026.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how this adaptation shapes up. It's unclear how involved FromSoftware will be, and there are large parts of Elden Ring's story that are purposely left ambiguous. Your journey through the worlds that FromSoftware creates is always part of the larger story the studio is telling, but players who deeply love digging into the lore for all of FromSoftware's games know that, for as much as you can discover, there will always be gaps in what you can say happened for certain, and what the real 'story' behind the characters you'll meet and fight is.</p>
<p>Which is also part of the fun of the story in FromSoftware games, that you can imagine your own version of events for characters, even if their ending is laid bare to you with their corpse lying at your feet after you rest at a bonfire/site of grace. Whatever Garland decides his take on an Elden Ring story will be, it will undoubtedly be food for discussion online.</p>
