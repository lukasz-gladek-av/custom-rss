			<p>Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch2-surpass-ps4-graphics/">significant compromises</a>.</p>
<p>The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games has just dropped the second Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. This one is heavily centered on Jason Duval, whereas the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trailer from December 2023</a> was arguably focused more on Lucia Caminos. We see her again, too, and it's clear the two are very much meant to be GTA's version of Bonnie and Clyde - two robbers very much in love. As for the rest, it's classic GTA to its finest - car chases, explosions, and larger-than-life characters briefly introduced to the fans.</p>
<p>The brief YouTube description of the video says:</p>
<p><em>Vice City, USA.</em></p>
<p><em>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</em></p>

<p>Rockstar Games has also launched the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Grand Theft Auto VI website</a>, which has already crashed due to excessive load. Thankfully, the developer also sent the press a copy of the first details on the game's characters and locations, as well as a boatload of new images.</p>

<p><em>Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. </em><em>Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out, but right now, it's hard to tell.</em></p>
<p><em>Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</em></p>
<p><em>More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. A life with Jason could be her way out. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes.</em></p>

<p>Vice City is described as offering something different in each neighborhood: Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, Tisha-Wocka, and VC Port. There's also the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the 'primordial expanse' of the Grassrivers, the forgotten coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and the wild country of Mount Kalaga.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to May 26, 2026. We still have a year and 20 days of wait left.</p>
