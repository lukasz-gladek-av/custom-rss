            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">confirmed</a> that the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles would be increasing globally, though the steepest increases would be hitting the US. Today, Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced</a> that, for the second time this year, the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles will be increased again, with the new prices going into effect in two weeks time on October 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Microsoft didn't specify exactly why prices are going up, instead citing "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." It added that understood "<em>that these changes are challenging,</em>" and reassures that they "<em>were made with careful consideration</em>." The price of accessories like controllers and headsets is staying the same for now, and the price of the console in countries outside of the US will also remain the same for now.</p>



<p>To recap, when the price of the consoles and accessories went up in may, the price of the Xbox Series S console went up $80, for both the 512GB and 1TB variants. The price of the Xbox Series X console went up $100, and the price of the 2TB special edition Xbox Series X went up $130. </p>



<p>Thankfully, today's increases aren't as steep, but it's still baffling to hear they're going up at all. While Microsoft doesn't mention the word 'tariffs,' the fact that the increases are isolated to the US points to the current US administration's tariffs as a likely reason behind the two price hikes within the last five months.</p>



<p>Starting October 3, 2025, these are the prices of the Xbox Series line of consoles: </p>



<ul>
<li>Xbox Series X - $649.99 ($50 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition - $799.99 ($70 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 512GB - $399.99 ($20 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 1TB - $449.99 ($20 increase)</li>
</ul>



<p>To be fair, Microsoft isn't the only hardware maker to raise the prices on its consoles. Sony raised the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price of the PS5 by $50 in the US just last month</a>, and while Nintendo has so far only raised the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">Switch 2 accessories</a>, the threat of a console price hike<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> still looms</a>.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though. These price increases won't help Microsoft move more units than they were before. Even if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">console is reportedly profitable</a>, it's difficult to imagine that the added revenue from these price hikes will have a meaningful impact due to how few units are actually being sold week-to-week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">October 2024</a>, Krafton and Unknown Worlds announced that Subnautica 2 would be launching in Early Access sometime in 2025. But as we passed the halfway mark of the year, a flurry of unexpected events happened.</p>



<p>It's been some time since we've heard an update regarding this suit, and in between the last update and today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> happened, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">Silksong was released</a>, and SEGA brought back its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">80s/90s-era tongue-in-cheek ad campaign</a> against Nintendo around its latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing game</a>, to name a few things. So you'd be forgiven if you need a refresher. There's a recap at the bottom of this article if you need it, but for now, let's jump into what's current.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/founders-of-subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-accuse-parent-company-krafton-of-changing-story-mid-litigation">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, two of Krafton's requests have been denied by the court: a forensic inspection request and a compelling preservation order, with both being deemed "<em>unnecessary</em>." But more importantly, the denial comes largely due to Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire claiming that Krafton has suddenly changed one of its key arguments.</p>



<p>When Krafton fired the three co-founders, one of the reasons cited in the termination notices was the claim that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were trying to release Subnautica 2 before it was ready. That makes sense, since Krafton has claimed time and again that the game simply wasn't ready for its early access launch.</p>



<p>Now, Krafton has changed its argument and has "<em>pivoted to a new theory that it admittedly came up with only after the fact: that it terminated the Founders and seized control because the Founders backed up files they were entitled to access in their work for Unknown Worlds</em>," says Fortis Advisors, the group representing the co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton's disorganized retreat raises more questions than answers. To say Krafton's new theory is a Hail Mary would be an understatement - both because the downloads were not wrongful and because Krafton claims not to have learned of them until after it had fired the Founders. The downloads cannot have been the actual motivation for termination</em>."</p>



<p>So, suddenly, it seems that according to Krafton, in this lawsuit, which was filed against them around Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, alleging, among other things, that they were wrongfully terminated, and where Krafton initially claimed they were terminated because they tried to launch Subnautica 2 before it was ready, the subject of Subnautica 2 being ready or not for launch is not relevant. </p>



<p>Adding to that, the question of Subnautica 2's readiness for launch wasn't why Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were fired. They were fired because of something Krafton learned about after they had already fired them.</p>



<p>Per a report from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton is now trying to focus on its claim that the co-founders abandoned their roles, and even the judge presiding over this case is confused by Krafton removing its argument that the co-founders tried to release the game early. "<em>Well, that's something that we definitely need to get to the bottom of today, because that is precisely what was cited as the reason in the answer</em>," said Judge Lori W. Will during a meeting between both sides to deliver a ruling on the motions presented.</p>



<p>PC Gamer also reports that Krafton hasn't been entirely cooperative as this suit kicks up, previously refusing to confer with Fortis Advisors, and only offering what Judge Lori W. Will described as a "<em>very narrow</em>" selection of emails for evidence, only offering ones where the words 'termination' and 'earnout' appeared.</p>



<p>The case is moving forward with both parties agreeing to confer, and we're back to waiting for the next major update.</p>



<p>To say that this has been a messy situation is yet another understatement to tack on to Krafton's alleged 'Hail Mary.' As I've mentioned before, it's unlikely we'll learn the whole truth of the situation, as allegations on both sides seem dire even if there's a bit of truth to them.</p>



<p>We'll continue to provide updates when new information is available. If you need a recap of what's happened before this, you can view it below.</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton. </li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>. </li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Sync Presentation, Shanghai-based VR manufacturer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pimax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimax</a> has unveiled three new Virtual Reality headsets based on its new Micro-OLED product line.</p>



<p>Micro-OLED technology is considered by some to be the future of virtual reality thanks to its ultra-high pixel density, near-infinite contrast, and deep blacks. However, it has so far presented significant challenges, including heat management, optical compatibility, and scaling to high resolutions. Pimax claims to have overcome these challenges with its proprietary three-element ConcaveView pancake optics, which enable Micro-OLED to deliver clarity and immersion without compromise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The widest FOV in micro-OLED VR Headsets | Pimax Sync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpSIZy_VZrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The most accessible headset of this trio is the Pimax Dream Air SE, which offers premium clarity with its 2560 x 2560 resolution per eye and ultra-sharp Micro-OLED panels. It is also extremely light at 140 grams, making it one of the lightest VR headsets ever manufactured. Its full-featured package includes built-in 6DOF SLAM tracking, Tobii eye-tracking, dynamic foveated rendering, and integrated spatial audio, making it ideal for everyday VR. The Dream Air SE is priced at $899 and can be pre-ordered <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Its larger sibling, the Pimax Dream Air, was presented by the manufacturer as their compact flagship featuring 3,840 x 3,552 resolution per eye — over 27 million pixels combined — with Sony Micro-OLED panels for unrivaled sharpness. Thanks to Pimax's ConcaveView pancake optics, the Dream Air achieves an unprecedented 110° horizontal and 120°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) for such a portable form factor. Weighing under 170 g, it is optimized for both gaming and professional applications with stereo overlap that enhances depth perception. It is far more expensive, though, at $1999. Pre-orders can be submitted <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, the Pimax Crystal Super goes even further with its 116° horizontal and 128°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) with Sony Micro-OLED panels and ConcaveView optics—the widest FOV ever achieved with Micro-OLED VR technology. As part of the modular Crystal ecosystem, it supports interchangeable optical engines, including Ultrawide, 57 PPD clarity-focused, and Micro-OLED. This gives users the flexibility to switch between maximum immersion and maximum sharpness. The price is $2199 and the VR headset can be purchased <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-crystal-super-sony-8k-micro-oled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Early adopters will receive exclusive bonus accessories from Pimax, including prescription lens frames and a free copy of Le Mans Ultimate. The products are scheduled to be released later in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-says-game-mods-don%E2%80%99t-count-as-%E2%80%9Cprior-art%E2%80%9D-in-its-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair.1302819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is well known for the litigious lengths it will go to, and its legal battle against Palworld developer PocketPair is just the latest major example of the company's legal team pushing things as far as they can. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">launched its suit almost exactly a year ago</a> at the time of this writing, and as the battle has ensued, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">changed the patents</a> it claims PocketPair is infringing to try to better align them with its arguments, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">successfully acquired new patents</a> to better stack its claims, and now, the latest argument being made to answer PocketPair's attempt to use game mods as part of their defense, is that game mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>This report comes from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Gamesfray</a>, which has followed the suit closely for months now. Essentially, PocketPair pointed to game mods as a way of trying to cut the legs off of Nintendo's claims. Nintendo responded by arguing that game mods are not prior art, because a mod for a game only works with that game, and doesn't run independently from it.</p>



<p>Nintendo would have the judge see mods as patentable by other parties, making Nintendo vulnerable to others taking ideas from Nintendo titles, patenting them, and using them in other games. That's why Nintendo wants the judge to believe mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>The potential ramifications of Nintendo securing a win with these arguments are pretty scary when you consider how far it could take such a precedent. We'd likely see even more legal action from Nintendo going after people who just wanted to make a cool mod, who put hours of their time and effort into creating an original mod for others to enjoy. And that's just on a smaller, individual scale. </p>



<p>Of course, that's if Nintendo is successful with these arguments. We've yet to hear what the judge presiding over the case has to say about what has been presented so far, and Gamesfray predicts that we won't hear any major updates for the remainder of the year.</p>



<p>Still, what's certain is that the outcome of this suit will have a major impact on the videogame industry, whichever way it goes.</p>
