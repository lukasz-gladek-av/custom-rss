			<p>EA announced in its latest <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">financial report</a> for Q4 of its 2025 fiscal year that the next Battlefield game will be fully revealed sometime this summer and will launch before the end of its 2026 fiscal year, ending April 2026. It also confirmed that the highly anticipated return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/">Skate</a> will arrive sometime in this fiscal year ending April 2026.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Wilson highlighted the release and reveal of Battlefield, calling it "<em>a pivotal step</em>" as the company moves forward in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline</em>," Wilson said. "<em>Beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment</em>."</p>
<p>Later in the report, EA states that it expects its revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to be driven by "<em>the EA Sports portfolio, The Sims, and the launches of Battlefield and Skate.</em>" Previously, EA announced that the new Skate game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">released in early access sometime this year</a>.
