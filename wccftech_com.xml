			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to be the best-looking console version of the game, as it will come with some exclusive features not available on the base console and on Xbox systems.</p>
<p>As confirmed today on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation blog</a>, the next entry in the series by Ubisoft, launching later this month, will offer multiple display modes on both base PS5 and PS5 Pro, which will all target 4K resolution via upscaling. Interestingly enough, all display modes will support ray tracing in some capacity, although Performance Mode on the base console will only offer selective ray tracing, which enables ray-traced global illumination in the Hideout. On PlayStation 5 Pro, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will offer extended ray tracing features, which enable ray-traced global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game, in its Fidelity Mode targeting 30 FPS gameplay, and its Balanced Mode targeting 40 FPS.</p>
<p>Together with the new details on Assassin’s Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro display modes, Ubisoft also released 20 minutes of new gameplay footage showcasing Naoe and Yasuke infiltrating Nijo Palace. You can check out the new footage below.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is setting out to be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, as Ubisoft detailed last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">Gamescom.</a></p>
