			<p>Nintendo first-party developed games rarely get discounts, but the Japanese publisher decided to briefly amend their pricing strategy just in time for Black Friday 2025, offering some of its best Nintendo Switch games at reduced prices.</p>



<p>Among the Switch games that can be purchased for reduced prices this week is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Mario Odyssey</strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">available for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">$39.99</strong></a> (50% off the MSRP). The game is also fully playable on Nintendo Switch 2, so if you never played the game before and own any of the Switch systems, there's no better time to get it, and experience what is widely considered one of the best 3D Mario games ever.</p>



<p>Other notable Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 deals include <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Splatoon 3, Princess Peach: Showtime, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong>, and many others. You can check out all the deals available this week by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nintendo+switch+games&amp;i=black-friday&amp;language=en_US&amp;crid=2AY0R6066IY62&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;linkId=ad1a5b1f9f5ebcd44c4563e3b1540d00&amp;sprefix=ps5+g%2Cblack-friday%2C517&amp;tag=wccftech0a9-20&amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl">heading over to Amazon.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-go-for-these-nintendo-switch-black-friday-2025-deals-now-or-wait">Should You Go For These Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 Deals Now or Wait?</h2>



<p>As Black Friday 2025 is still a few days away, some additional deals are expected to become available as we get closer to November 28.</p>



<p>However, given Nintendo's historical stance on pricing and their previous Black Friday deals, it is doubtful you will be able to find better discounts than these in the next couple of days. Nintendo’s first-party titles are known to maintain their value for years. As such, you should definitely take advantage of these deals as soon as possible before stock runs out.</p>

			<p>As FromSoftware continues working on Elden Ring Nightreign, the Japanese development studio is also hard at work on The Duskbloods, which reportedly is a game the developer has spent time on fine tuning gameplay the most.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ziostorm">Ziostorm</a>, a Chinese journalist who provided accurate information on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> before the game's release, recently revealed some small, exciting tidbits about FromSoftware's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. The game was reportedly greenlit even before the marketing campaign for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> started, and it is the game that FromSoftware has spent the most time on gameplay among all of their games.</p>



<p>All the time spent on prototyping The Duskbloods' gameplay is reportedly paying off, as the game, although PvEvP, features many innovative gameplay elements that the team is really proud of. So much so that the journalist speculates the game could influence games from other studios as much as the aforementioned Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice did, especially with the parry mechanics that are now prevalent in almost every action game.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small bit of information on The Duskbloods, the known Chinese journalist also revealed that we should see more of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/">Elden Ring Nightreign DLC, The Forsaken Hollow</a>, soon. Apparently, three more trailers should be released before the game launches on December 4 to showcase the two new Nightfarers - the Scholar and the Undertaker - and the new content in a final launch trailer. As the expansion is nearing release, these trailers, if they are indeed coming, shouldn't be more than a few days away.</p>

<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">When it was revealed during the first Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct ever earlier this year</a>, many, including myself, jumped at the screen at the first footage of The Duskbloods, as the game looked like a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/bloodborne/">Bloodborne</a>. However, the Switch 2 exclusive is going to be a much different game, having been built from the ground up as a multiplayer experience, which left a few disappointed, as FromSoftware is primarily known for its single-player experiences with multiplayer elements sprinkled on top.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the game's supposed innovative gameplay elements will make it a compelling experience for all fans of the studio, possibly turning doubters' opinions around as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign did for me when it launched earlier this year on PC and consoles.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ferocious-is-an-indie-single-player-fps-where-you-fight-dinosaurs-but-also-control-them-and-it%E2%80%99s-out-on-december-4.1362526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the indie single player first-person shooter game FEROCIOUS will be released on December 4 for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/?mc_cid=5e1f5669c5&amp;mc_eid=728a334a9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>FEROCIOUS, powered by Unity, is the debut game of OMYOG, a small studio that features the expertise of both AAA game and film veterans. Leonard Saalfrank, inspired by King Kong, leads the vision, while Mark, ex-Far Cry and Battlefront II director, brings sandbox-level design expertise. Writers like Jörg Ihle and Dominik Hochwald add narrative depth from film, games, and theme parks.</p>



<p>In FEROCIOUS, players will find themselves stranded on a dangerous island and forced to survive against mercenaries, dinosaurs, and a vibrant yet hostile ecosystem. At every turn, they must face challenges in the form of savage predators, treacherous terrain, and limited resources. Careful exploration is vital to uncover hidden paths, secrets and essential gear. Furthermore, as shown in the release date trailer (embedded below), there's a twist in that a so-called 'dino control device' lets you turn the dinosaurs to your side, so that they might be used to attack enemies, open paths, or infiltrate guarded areas. </p>



<p>The lore explanation is that it scans the creature's brain and reproduces its vocal signals, not unlike what was shown in Jurassic Park 3, but with the usage of ultrasonic calls that only the lizards can hear. Once scanned, the player can get a dinosaur to follow them, move to a particular spot, attack a target, break obstacles, or even fetch items. The commands depend on the species; some are more obedient (or smarter) than others. Not every dinosaur in the game will be controllable, though.</p>

<p>TinyBuild did not share the pricing yet, but given that it's an indie game, we expect it to be priced accordingly. The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for FEROCIOUS, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5 4th Gen or AMD equivalent<br>Memory: 12 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5 3600 and up<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>
