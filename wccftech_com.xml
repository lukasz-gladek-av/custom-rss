			<p><strong>Take-Two Interactive's</strong> <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings">third-quarter financial results have been published</a>, which means there's plenty of information to glean from the company behind <strong>2K</strong> and <strong>Rockstar's</strong> latest numbers. What everyone wants to hear about, though, is <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which may just be the most anticipated video game ever, and in the meantime, <strong>GTA V</strong> has hit yet another astronomical sales milestone.</p>



<p>While Take-Two's chief executive officer, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, didn't get too deep into what's coming for <strong>GTA VI</strong>, he did confirm in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">The Game Business</a> and during the call with investors that we can expect more "<em>marketing beats</em>" for the game during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. He also reaffirmed the game's release date, which is, as of the time of this writing, still set to be <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>We feel great about it</em>," Zelnick told The Game Business. He added, "<em>You know me pretty well, for me to even say we've got marketing beats coming this summer, is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, on GTA VI's release date, we heard that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">November date is a "<em>more real</em>" release window than its previous 2025 date</a>. Before that, Zelnick said <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">his confidence level that the game would not be delayed was <strong>"<em>very, very high</em>."</strong></a> Everything Take-Two is projecting in this report supports that it will indeed be launching this coming November. Hopefully, that's still the case the closer we get to the date, though a lot can always change in the coming months. </p>



<p>Regarding GTA V's new sales milestone, Take-Two reports that the game has sold an astounding <strong>225 million copies</strong> over the last decade plus. It adds that the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series has, overall, sold a whopping <strong>465 million copies</strong> in its lifetime, which means that on its own, GTA V accounts for almost half of all copies of a Grand Theft Auto game that have been sold since the series launched in 1997.</p>



<p>Overall, Take-Two reported <strong>$1.76 billion</strong> in net bookings, well above its projected $1.6 billion for its third quarter, with Grand Theft Auto contributing its fair share to the increase in revenue. <strong>GTA Online,</strong> for its part, saw a <strong>27% increase</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>While everything is coming up roses in Take-Two's financials, its subsidiary and Grand Theft Auto VI developer, Rockstar, continues to be under pressure from unions over the firing of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">31 workers in the UK</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">three workers in Canada</a></strong>. Rockstar continues to claim that these workers were leaking confidential information, while the IWGB union representing the fired workers continues to refute those claims and accuses Rockstar of union-busting.</p>



<p>The most recent update in that case was <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">a UK judge denying the fired workers' interim pay</a>, though the case itself is far from over.</p>
