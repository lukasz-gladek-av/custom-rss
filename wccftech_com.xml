			<p>We've known from the Steam concurrent player figures that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has had a strong launch</a>, despite the performance issues that led Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share some 'advice' with the community</a>.</p>



<p>2K and Gearbox have stayed silent so far, though. Thankfully, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the analyst firm's initial estimates, revealing that Borderlands 4 has already passed two million units sold across all platforms, and one million on Steam alone (750K in the first week), generating over $150 million in revenue. This also means it beat even Hollow Knight: Silksong, at least on Steam, as well as other hot indies like Peak. Despite the launch of a highly anticipated triple-A game like Borderlands 4, the indie games did very well for themselves, with Silksong and Peak at the head of the pack. Even the original Hollow Knight sold another 205K units last week. Lastly, the South Korean cooperative roguelite game Shape of Dreams also sold nearly 200K units, a big success for the two-man indie development team Lizard Smoothie.</p>

<p>The Alinea Analytics report also discusses Dying Light: The Beast, which is out tomorrow after being bumped up by one day because <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techland celebrated the game's one million pre-orders</a>. According to the analyst firm, however, things are a little more nuanced than that. As you might remember, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> started its life as the second Dying Light 2: Stay Human DLC before evolving into its own standalone game. Those who purchased Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition were entitled to two DLCs, so Techland will provide them access to Dying Light: The Beast. Alinea Analytics infers there are about 700-800K of these users, given that the actual Steam pre-orders for the new game are around 100K, and the rest must be pre-orders from consoles.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, AdHoc Studio announced the release date for their upcoming game, Dispatch. The 'superhero workplace comedy' will be released on October 22 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and PlayStation 5, and it will adopt a bi-weekly episodic format, hearkening back to the Telltale days, with two episodes each week (there will be four in total). The studio was founded by several former Telltale Studios developers (including writers of The Wolf Among Us and Tales from the Borderlands), so that makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>In Dispatch, you play Robert Robertson, also known as Mecha Man. After his mech-suit is destroyed in a battle against his nemesis, he is forced to take a job at a superhero dispatch center as a dispatcher, not a hero. Robertson must rehabilitate a group of ex-supervillains, managing the roster, navigating office relationships, while also rebuilding his suit for a shot at revenge.</p>



<p>There is a strategic layer to the game. AdHoc promises that every decision made by the player influences the unfolding narrative, affecting Robertson's relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path his story takes. The strategy map can be used to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Players must balance the risks and rewards as they make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for the team and the city.</p>



<p>Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero has quirks, flaws, and baggage players must navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>

<p>Dispatch features a star-studded voice cast. The protagonist, Robert Roberson, is voiced by renowned actor Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad, Westworld), and players will also find the likes of Jeffrey Wright (The Batman, Westworld, American Fiction), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Resident Evil 6, Overwatch), and Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina, The Last of Us Part II, Marvel's Spider-Man), among others. The full season is priced at $30, and there's a Deluxe Edition priced $40 that includes a digital artbook and four digital comics. PC players can download a demo right now from Steam.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, TaleWorlds <a href="https://x.com/Mount_and_Blade/status/1967643361222746569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a big Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord beta update (version 1.3). Steam users can access it by switching to the beta branch in the game's library, though the developer warns that game compatibility with previous saves is not 100% guaranteed, and there may be some instability yet.</p>



<p>No doubt many will give it a try, though, as it's a sizable update that introduces many new features. For example, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord now has a proper stealth system for breaking out of prison and taking on hideouts. NPCs can detect player characters through sight and sound and react to movement, noise, bodies, or alarmed allies. They see more clearly when looking down, but struggle a bit to spot movement above them. Light exposure also plays a role, according to TaleWorlds, with shadows and nighttime offering concealment, while areas lit by torches make you stand out. Natural hiding spots such as tall grass and dark corners also provide stealth, and crouching reduces visibility further.</p>



<p>The NPCs will cycle through four states of alertness: Neutral, Cautious, Searching, and Fully Alarmed. This Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord patch also introduces distraction mechanics with thrown objects and noise-making, but some enemies will resist being diverted. Stealth attacks deal bonus damage to unaware targets, and certain weapons allow for crouched melee and ranged strikes. Players can drag bodies to hide them and prevent alarms from being raised. The player character's roguery skill now also impacts the damage dealt by stealth attacks and your speed and noise level while crouched.</p>



<p>TaleWorlds also added a disguise system to complement stealth. Disguise relies specifically on inconspicuousness; suspicious actions, such as running, drawing weapons, or hiding, raise the guards' suspicion. High suspicion triggers a guard investigation. If you break line of sight, the guards will eventually return to their posts.</p>



<p>If you are identified, your cover is blown, and all guards are placed on full alert and initiate pursuit. Escape requires leaving the settlement, and capture results in imprisonment. If you successfully establish a contact, you can explore the town in disguise, including in any future entries.</p>



<p>But there's more, a lot more to this Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord update, including a significant overhaul for diplomacy. Players can now establish alliances between two kingdoms; each kingdom can have up to two alliances, and an alliance will last for one in-game year. Trade agreements can also be arranged and will feature the same format (up to two, lasting one in-game year). There's even a parley feature with enemy-held settlements containing nobles, where you can select who you wish to speak to from the present nobles.</p>



<p>A new ranged weapon, the Slings, has been introduced to the game. They are one-handed and can be used alongside a shield. Morale and retreat systems have been added to battles and simulations, introducing an extra strategic layer.</p>



<p>There are now up to a hundred random events that players can encounter while playing; these are resolved through pop-up menus, and the resulting choices will influence your character's traits, skills, party, items, or gold. Lastly, there's a new Deserter faction and a new Patrol party type.</p>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord is being prepared for its first expansion, War Sails, which will enrich the game with a full-fledged naval warfare system and a new race, the Nords. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in June</a>, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-2-bannerlord-war-sails-dlc-gameplay-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Fall 2025</a>.</p>
