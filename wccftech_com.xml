			<p>Over the weekend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">Ubisoft</a></strong> hosted the <strong>Rainbow Six Siege Six Invitationals</strong> tournament in Paris, where it also took the opportunity to reveal what players can expect in <strong>Year 11</strong> of Rainbow Six Siege, starting with <strong>Season 1: Operation Silent Hunt</strong>, which arrives on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> and adds an iconic stealth-action hero to its Operators roster: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/">Metal Gear Solid's</a></strong> own <strong>Solid Snake.</strong></p>



<p>The collaboration between <strong>Konami</strong> and Ubisoft means we can finally have two of the video game industry's most well-known stealth icons work together, between Solid Snake and <strong>Splinter Cell's</strong> protagonist, <strong>Sam Fisher</strong>. Which is exactly what Ubisoft showcases in its Solid Snake reveal trailer, with <strong>David Hayter</strong> returning to voice his iconic character, which you can check out below.</p>



<p>As part of his introduction to the roster, Snake and Fisher will team up in a new infiltration mode 4v4 event where they lead a team of operatives to recover stolen data. Snake's iconic Tactical .45 semi-automatic pistol with its integrated suppressor is also joining the weapons arsenal.</p>

<p>"<em>We're excited to bring the world of Metal Gear Solid series into Rainbow Six Siege with Season 1's new Redacted event, a limited-time 4v4 infiltration mode where Snake and Zero lead a team of elite operators to recover stolen data</em>," said <strong>Joshua Mills</strong>, the recently crowned creative director of Rainbow Six Siege who took over from <strong>Alex Karpazis</strong>, after Karpazis announced he would be moving elsewhere within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>"<em>Players will also discover exclusive skins such as Jackal as Grat Fox and Ash as Meryl, and we're thrilled to have David Hayter lend his iconic voice to Snake's in-game cues. The team also went a step further with 'Last Assignment,' a new mission for Dual Front designed as a special nod to long-time Metal Gear Solid series fans</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of Dual Front, Year 11's Season 1 will be the last season to include Dual Front, with the mode getting removed at the start of Season 2. Season 1 also introduces a new cadence of updates, with the Rainbow Six team now aligning to deliver four balancing updates and two Ranked map rotations per season. </p>



<p>Season 1 also adds a new limited-time mode (LTM) that lets players go one-on-one in a new arcade mode. "<em>This fast-paced duel mode strips Siege down to its fundamentals and offers players the opportunity to challenge friends and random online players alike, or to test their pure mechanical duel skills</em>," Ubisoft writes in a press release.</p>



<p>Looking beyond Season 1, Season 2 will add some Rainbow Six nostalgia for players who remember the series' Vegas era with the arrival of the <strong>Calypso Casino</strong> map, while Season 3 will add a brand-new Defender operator to the roster, and Season 4 is set to introduce a new Social Hub to the game, giving players a space to hang out in-game without trying to shoot at each other.</p>

			<p>Following the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series X|S</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> earlier this year and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></strong> this June, the third and final entry in the remake trilogy is the only entry in the series that is set to release on every modern gaming platform. While this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">multiplatform pivot</a></strong> has been welcomed by Switch 2 and Xbox players, many have voiced concerns that the final part of the trilogy will have to make some compromises in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">visual quality</strong> due to the lower specifications of the Nintendo Switch and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, besides continuing to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, this will not be the case, as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong> development team's approach takes platform differences into consideration while scaling down from the lead version of the game: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC version</strong>.</p>



<p><em>"The quality of the trilogy will not be diminished, and that's not the kind of development structure we have in the first place,"</em> said <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in a fresh interview with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7f-20260216-421552/">Automaton</a></strong>. <em>"I think I have no choice but to keep saying this."</em></p>



<p>Realizing that the concerns may be justified, as he never went in-depth on why <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't be dragged down</strong> by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S, Hamaguchi-san provided a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">thorough explanation</strong> on why this won't happen, breaking things down by component, starting with potential <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ROM limitations</strong> deriving from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges</strong>. As the game will launch at retail on a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game-Key Card</strong>, file size will not be an issue on the other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-managing-ram-on-nintendo-switch-2-vs-xbox-series-s">Managing RAM on Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Xbox Series S</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-RAM.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With proper RAM optimization, Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 will not be dragged down by the Switch 2 and Xbox Series S versions.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM</strong> is among the biggest difference between modern consoles, but this too won't be a concern for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The Nintendo Switch 2 has plenty of RAM, so it shouldn't be affected. It's true that it will struggle with the Xbox Series S, but that's been addressed by fine-tuning each platform to the utmost. So, RAM issues won't restrict other platforms,"</em> Hamaguchi-san explained.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-npc-density-will-be-critical-for-cpu-optimization">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 NPC Density Will Be Critical For CPU Optimization</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-part-3-NPCs-Density.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3's world may feel a little less lively on lower-end platforms</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The differences in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU</strong> between the systems are unlikely to be a cause for concern. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The way we currently make games is that if a game runs at 30fps on PS4, Nintendo Switch 2, or Xbox Series S, then it should be able to run at 60fps on a high-end platform. In other words, we don't design games with the assumption that it will run at 30fps on a high-end CPU and use all of its available capacity,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"For hardware with CPU power to spare, we use a method of scaling only the density of NPCs in towns, such as the number of NPCs. This means that towns may feel more lively on high-spec hardware, while the number of NPCs may be lower on other hardware."</em> As such, the director of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 believes the team is unlikely to encounter <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU-related issues</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gpu-optimization-and-asset-reduction-from-leading-pc-platform">GPU Optimization and Asset Reduction From Leading PC Platform</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-PC-leading-platform.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Those with high-end PCs will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 at their best, according to Hamaguchi-san.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The final concern fans have, and the one Hamaguchi-san recognizes is the biggest, is related to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong>. Even in this case, however, the Final Fantasy VII Remake series director believes there won't be issues, thanks to <span>the team's development approach, which&nbsp;<strong>scales down from the leading PC version</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>focuses on&nbsp;</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">optimization</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The FFVII Remake series has been purchased by a huge number of customers on Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we are also conscious of creating assets for the wider PC market during development. That's why we create 3D asset data with the highest asset quality based on PC,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em>"As a basic data design, we don't conform to low standards, but create assets for even higher-end use. We call this reduction, and the design involves adjusting and tuning the asset level to suit each platform. In that sense, it's a design philosophy that basically doesn't affect high-spec platforms. This isn't just something we do, but is a relatively common way of thinking in game development environments these days."</em> As such, those with high-end platforms will be able to enjoy the game at its best, while console players will still have a <strong>great experience tailored to their hardware</strong> of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-is-now-playable">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Is "Now Playable"</h2>



<p>After the end of this exhausting explanation, Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">update on the yet-to-be-revealed Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Development is proceeding almost exactly on time, according to the schedule and milestones set at the beginning of development, and the game is now playable. As a team, we are in the final push to continue developing the game, so the quality is improving day by day, and as a repeat player, the scenery changes every day, making it exciting. So, I think that in the not-too-distant future, we will have an opportunity to share some information with you all."</em> </p>



<p>Hopefully, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/">it really won't take much longer</a></strong> to finally see this highly anticipated game in action.</p>
