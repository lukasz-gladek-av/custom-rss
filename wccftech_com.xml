			<p>MachineGames isn't done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">whip-cracking explorer who was named after his family's dog</a>, as the studio announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants today during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025.</p>
<p>The Order of Giants is a DLC expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and it'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this coming&nbsp;<strong>September 4, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It is a paid DLC expansion, but if you already purchased the premium edition of The Great Circle, or at least bought the premium upgrade, then you don't have to spend another dime to get this DLC; all you'll have to do is download an update when the DLC launches. Players who also bought the collector's edition of The Great Circle also don't have to buy the DLC separately.</p>
<p>The story of the DLC takes place during the events of the main game, after Indy meets Father Ricci in Rome, and according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-great-circle-dlc-order-giants-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire</a> post, the expansion "<em>introduces stunning new locations, intricate puzzles, terrifying new foes and more</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>One of the most satisfying parts of developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was the opportunity to create the Nephilim Order, the secret society of giants formed by descendants of fallen angels working to atone for their ancestral sins,</em>" said John Jennings, production director on the game.</p>
<p>"<em>That story spans thousands of years and this DLC has given us the opportunity to develop further upon their lore and look at other aspects not covered in the initial story campaign. There's something new and unexpected to tell here for fans of the game, and we can't wait for people to be able to play it for themselves.</em>"</p>

			<p>Resonance - A Plague Tale, the third entry in the series developed by Asobo Studio, has been revealed today for a 2026 release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series was revealed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfssswW0qf4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new trailer</a> shared during today's Xbox Games Showcase, providing a first look at the setting and main character. Resonance - A Plague Tale will be set fifteen years before A Plague Tale: Requiem and will star the young woman Sofia as she seeks her independence as a fierce plunderer in the unforgiving world of the 14th century. No rat was spotted in the trailer, but there will definitely be no shortage of dangers to overcome when the game launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how A Plague Tale: Requiem improved on its predecessor's formula in a lot of different ways, we should expect Resonance - A Plague Tale to move the series forward considerably. In case you have never had the chance to experience Amicia and Hugo's latest adventure, you can learn more about it by checking out Chris'<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-plague-tale-requiem-review/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a faithful follow-up to the first outing, managing to expand in every way while staying true to what made the first great. With solid gameplay, a fantastic story that's excellently acted and presented, and set pieces that could challenge even the biggest game in the industry, if you like the first outing from Asobo Studio, you will love this.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc.1212060/</guid>

			<p>Kicking off the Xbox Games 2025 Showcase was The Outer Worlds 2, with Obsidian Entertainment making sure no one had to wait for <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> after the rest of the showcase to learn that The Outer Worlds 2 will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <strong>October 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new story trailer showcased a good chunk of gameplay and a bit more of an insight into the game's story, where you'll step into the shoes of an Earth Directorate agent, tasked with uncovering the mystery behind a rift that could destroy all of humanity.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUDdFBFTYRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this release date set, Obsidian is on the brink of releasing two strong RPGs in the same year, after it kicked things off with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a> earlier in the year. However, Avowed was a new world for players to step into. The stakes for a sequel are quite different for Obsidian's second release of the year.</p>
<p>The first game was a strong foundation that struck a chord with players, but didn't entirely knock it out of the park compared to Obsidian's previous RPG outings.</p>
<p>At the time of the first game's release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> was impressed with the game, but still recommended it with a few caveats.</p>
<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully Alessio is right that the sequel can step things up this time around.</p>
