			<p>Developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive has released a new trailer for Killing Floor 3 ahead of its launch next week on July 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Technically, Killing Floor 3 should have been out for months by now. First announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/">Gamescom 2023</a>, it was initially due to arrive on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25, 2025</a>. However, just a week into March, Tripwire Interactive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">the shooter would be delayed</a>, and though it didn't reveal a new release date at the time, it promised it would arrive sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Two months later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">in May</a>, Tripwire confirmed that the delay would only last four months, with a new release date set for July 24, 2025. Today's new launch trailer seems to confirm that there won't be any more unexpected delays, and that players can look forward to jumping onto the killing floor next week with their friends regardless of platform, since Killing Floor 3 will support full crossplay between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, at launch.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 takes place 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2, and in that time, Horzine has created a horde of monstrous creatures called Zeds. Now, Mr. Foster and the Nightfall crew are the only thing standing between the army of Zeds and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If this trailer is to be believed, then Killing Floor 3 will be an explosive and action-packed game. We'll see how players respond to it when it arrives next week. </p>

			<p>The Epic Games Store has kicked off its new Summer Sale, which will run from today, July 17, to the end of the month on July 31, and while it'll feature a number of solid deals, its best deal is probably the fact that you can grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civ-vi-rise-and-fall-expanding-greatness/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a> for free.</p>



<p>Not just the base game for Civilization VI, mind you, but the Platinum Edition of the game, which includes its six DLC packs and two expansions. It's everything under the sun that's Civilization VI related, and the perfect deal for anyone who was perhaps unsure about jumping into Civilization VII.</p>



<p>It was made available for free starting today, July 17, and will only be available to grab until next week on July 24 at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST. So make sure to redeem it at some point in the week before then, to add it to your library and ensure you can download and play it through the Epic Games Store at any time in the future. </p>



<p>When it comes to what's not free on the EGS, some of the more notable deals include Red Dead Redemption 2 being 75% off and Cyberpunk 2077 being 60% off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077 also recently got yet another significant update</a> from CD Projekt RED, making it once again another good time to jump into the game if you've not yet played it. </p>



<p>There are also a few notable games that came out this year that are on sale, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire</a> on sale for 20% off,  and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> on sale for 10% off. </p>
