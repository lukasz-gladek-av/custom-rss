			<p>Brendan Greene, more commonly known as PLAYERUNKNOWN, has dropped a lot of announcements at the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025. To start with, his company has released a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. This demo is meant to showcase the in-house Melba engine that PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has been developing. Greene said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU. This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback contributes to its future development.</em></p>
<p>The studio also launched the Steam page for their first actual game, the single player survival open world title Prologue: Go Wayback!, which will allow the development team to test the machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, enabling the instant creation of millions of maps.</p>
<p>In Prologue: A Way Back, players will explore a detailed world where emergent systems influence gameplay. They'll face unpredictable weather events and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to escape the untamed wilderness.</p>
<p>A series of playtests should start soon, with the objective of launching the game on Steam Early Access in Q2 of 2025.</p>

<p>Lastly, PLAYERUNKNOWN outlined his vision for the final game in this slate, codenamed Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time, and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds weâ€™re developing.</em></p>

<p>Last we heard about Artemis, PLAYERUNKNOWN <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-says-prologue-will-likely-be-boring-artemis-will-be-planet-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be 'planet-sized'. That was over three years ago, so things might have changed, but it definitely sounds like the goal is still to make an absolutely massive world.</p>

			<p>Since its release, Citizen Sleeper has been remarked as one of the best indie games of recent times. It even has a Lost in Cult Design Works book dedicated to the game. It's been revealed today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that the sequel to the sci-fi RPG will be released on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 31 January 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was released in 2022 and won multiple awards, as well as being nominated for four BAFTAS, which included British Game and Game for Impact. This title explores political themes and is accompanied by a fantastically immersive soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpiEhTVuISc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Jump Over The Age has decided to bring back the Hexport demo so that those interested in the upcoming game can get a taste of what's to come in the full release of Citizen Sleeper's sequel. This demo was previously released for a limited time during Steam Next Fest and will now be available from today until 8 December.</p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector was first announced in June 2023, and it's been stated by the developers that the sequel will be sticking to a similar template to the first game, as you follow a new Sleeper android protagonist out into space, using the same dice mechanics that were used in the first game. It's been said by Creator Gareth Damian Martin that the central theme for the sequel was "crisis," which is something that the world has seen a lot of. The influences for the theme came from major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a talk with RockPaperShotgun, Gareth Damian Martin spoke about what narrative means to him, and how he uses it to affect the players: "When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything. Because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist," says Martin.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favorite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p>
<p>January is just around the corner, and those excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector won't have long to wait at all. Until then, check out the trailer above and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3198860/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector__Hexport_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexport demo</a> on Steam.</p>

			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">11 Bit Studios</a> and developer Digital Sun have announced that a sequel to Moonlight will be released next year. The sequel is called Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. Moonlighter was an incredibly successful indie game with tons of replayability. In this game, you'll get to step back into the shoes of merchant Will, in this roguelike action title, where you get to see adventure and shopkeeping combine to make a fun adventure. Just like in Moonlighter, you have to go on a long and arduous journey that takes you through vibrant landscapes as you try to uncover mysterious relics. Of course, there will be tons of enemies along the way, traps, and challenges that are set to make your journey more challenging than it already is. Luckily, you'll have an arsenal of weapons, including your iconic backpack from the first game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0v6DAShxqIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When you make it back from your journey, you'll be back at your cozy shop, which also serves as your home and hub, allowing you to turn the goodies you discovered into profit. You can haggle for the best prices, assist customers and make sure to keep your store looking spic and span while adding decorations and perks and dealing with the mess. Of course, you will also be able to utilize your profit to upgrade your gear, as well as upgrade your store to get the most benefits from it.</p>
<p>"The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we've learned along the way. We're channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that's not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail," says Digital Sun CEO Javier Gimenez.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're looking forward to, make sure to check out the trailer above. It showcases some of the reminiscent details from the original game while setting the scene of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault.</p>
<p>There are many great features to look forward to in the upcoming release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, including a brilliant soundtrack made by Chris Larkin, who also made the iconic soundtrack for Hollow Knight.</p>
