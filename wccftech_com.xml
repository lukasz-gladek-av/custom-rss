			<p>PlayStation has announced a new State of Play event for tomorrow, June 4, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT / 11pm CEST, that will be more than 40 minutes long and feature "<em>news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe</em>."</p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">PlayStation Blog</a>, as these kinds of events always are now, with nothing more than the short description quoted above to give a very opaque, general idea as to what players will see at the show.</p>
<p>It's the first big game-announcements-focused show of the week ahead of the big Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off show, which technically makes it the real kick-off event of this announcements-driven week that we're about to have.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as what we'll see, the news of this showcase makes the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9 reveal rumors</a> feel all the more possible, as we've previously seen major Resident Evil games, like Resident Evil Village, get their reveal during a PlayStation event.&nbsp;Another game to look out for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, which is still without a release date, but is due to get a release date soon after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/"> gameplay trailer we saw earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Also, it's a State of Play event, which doesn't always feature first-party PlayStation games, but it wouldn't be too outlandish to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">Ghost of Yotei</a> once more, or even just the news that a specialized Ghost of Yotei event is coming ahead of that game's launch in October. We'll have to see what tomorrow holds.</p>

			<p>Today, South Korean developer and publisher NEOWIZ (Lies of P) announced the signing of a new publishing deal with the Chinese company Shadowlight. Founded in Shanghai by five recent graduates, this team has known each other for years and participated in many university-level game development competitions in China, earning numerous awards. In 2023, HYPERGRYPH, the developer of Arknights, invested in Shadowlight and has been part of their COREBLAZER incubator program ever since.</p>
<p>The publishing deal is for an upcoming detective adventure game titled Kill the Shadow, which is centered on a protagonist who can rewind time. Kill the Shadow features a unique aesthetic that blends high-definition 3D environments with 2D pixel characters. In Kill the Shadow, players must investigate and deduce various bizarre cases in an alternate post-war divided city. During Steam Next Fest last year, Shadowlight <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947640/Kill_The_Shadow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a demo of the game, which received a very positive user rating. Several comments praised the game's story, reasoning system and visual novelty.</p>
<p>Kim Seung-chul, Co-CEO at NEOWIZ, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>What initially drew us to Shadowlight was a collaborative development philosophy to deliver premium narrative games for PC and console audiences. We look forward to working closely with the team to release Kill the Shadow globally, and we hope audiences find the same charm we experienced as we reveal more about the title.</em></p>
<p>Black, CEO of Shadowlight, added:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is a reliable global publisher, and we were grateful to find a partner who shares our philosophy on game development. As we see the games industry evolve to be inclusive of other cultures, itâ€™s important to have a publisher that is open to collaborating and emphasizing the significance of your content.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, NEOWIZ has recently signed other publishing deals with Western developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfeye Studios</a>, Zakazane, and Lizard Smoothie.</p>
