			<p>Asobo Studios recently patched Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with Sim Update 3 to include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The technology allows owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards to achieve even higher frame rates, accelerating performance by 4.2x on average compared to DLSS off.</p>

<p>In two days, the third-person action/adventure game Hell is Us will also launch with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Of course, those equipped with older RTX GPUs can still activate DLSS Frame Generation and/or DLSS Super Resolution. Moreover, Hell is Us is among those games that have been initially selected to be upgraded for the NVIDIA RTX Blackwell update on GeForce NOW, which means GeForce NOW Ultimate subscribers will be able to activate NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation even on the cloud. By the way, Hell is Us received a great score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review on Wccftech</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences. With a rich atmosphere, stunning visuals, deep lore, wonderfully realized characters and a fairly solid combat experience, it's not a game to be missed.</em></p>



<p>On the same day, Thursday, September 4, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting its The Order of Giants DLC (on which you may read <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an exclusive interview with the developers from Gamescom 2025</a>). The free update that goes live alongside the DLC will add the long-awaited NVIDIA RTX Hair feature to the game, improving the quality of hair and other hair-related rendering elements for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

<p>The following day, Friday, September 5, will mark the launch of Bloober Team's new horror IP Cronos: The New Dawn, which also includes day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

<p>As a side note, NVIDIA announced that many big US retailers have just restocked GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-announcement-patch-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-september-4-announcement-is-not-related-to-new-patch-or-dlc.1286322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new announcement related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be made later this week, but it won't be about new content hitting the game, a CD Projekt Red representative confirmed.</p>



<p>Commenting on speculation made about the announcement on X, CD Projekt Red Senior Community Manager Amelia "Lilayah" confirmed the announcement won't be about a new patch or new DLC. The community manager also reiterated that no Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is in the works, unsurprisingly, so expectations should be kept in check regarding the game getting some new major content in the future.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch.</p>— Amelia "Lilayah" (@Lilayaah) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for what the Cyberpunk 2077 announcement coming on September 4 will be about, no one can say at the moment. This announcement was teased yesterday with an in-lore recruitment ad from the New United States of America, of which Night City is part, revealing a recruitment test for <em>"brave netrunners"</em> willing to join the nation's effort to overcome a mounting cybersecurity threat. Given how Project Orion, the second entry in the series, is still very far from release, could this be a colorful way to announce playtests for an upcoming, smaller project related to the series? Thankfully, the announcement is only a few days away, so it won't take much longer to find out what this is about.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-boss-randy-pitchford-says-nintendo-just-had-the-most-successful-new-console-launch-in-the-history-of-video-game-consoles-with-the-switch-2-so-of-course-he-wants-to-bring-more-games-to-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> at Gamescom 2025, Gearbox founder, president, and CEO Randy Pitchford has reiterated his profound love for the Nintendo Switch 2 console (<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is getting Borderlands 4 on October 3</a>, just a couple of weeks after the launch on PC and the other consoles). Pitchford also expressed the desire to bring more Gearbox games to the platform, though he wouldn't elaborate any further than that on this topic.</p>



<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an awesome, awesome machine – I'm so grateful for it. It's less about innovating and more about perfecting, and giving us what we want and what works. I love my Switch, and I kind of wanted a more powerful one with newer games. When I got the briefing and realized, 'oh, it's more than that, Nintendo has invested a lot, not just in the hardware, but in the software, and making it easier than ever to connect with other people. This is getting exciting.</em></p>



<p><em>I love Switch, and I love my Nintendo Switch 2, and I think that without getting in trouble and trying to talk about things that are from the future, we love making games, and we love entertaining people, and we want to be on the platforms where the people that want us to be are. And Nintendo just had the most successful new console launch in the history of video game consoles, and I don't think that's slowing down.</em> <em>I love that platform, and I want to bring more games to it, but it's really not the right time for me to talk about games that are down the road.</em></p>



<p>As far as we know, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-and-brothers-in-arms-games-listed-on-developers-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working</a> on a new Brothers in Arms game and possibly Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, a sequel to the 2022 spin-off featuring the titular Tiny Tina as the 'dungeon master'. The completion status of these projects is currently unclear.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 New Season One Map Leaked in New Footage]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-map-footage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-new-season-one-map-leaked-in-new-footage.1286211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>
