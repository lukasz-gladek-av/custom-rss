			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published its year-in-review <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/year-in-review-2025-to-date">report for January to November 2025</a> for the global video games market, a year marked by the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, and engagement-driven growth on PC, beating out consoles and mobile. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">After yesterday's news from Circana</a> outlining how November 2025 was one of the worst months for US physical game sales and hardware sales in 30 years, Newzoo's report on the global industry is a reminder that, at least on the consumer side, things are still trending in a positive direction. Issues like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">tariffs, the rising cost of living</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/after-dell-acer-asus-have-surrendered-to-memory-shortages/">now memory shortages</a> could have more of an impact in 2026, but as of the end of 2025, Newzoo expects the global games market to rise 7.5% compared to 2024 when all the 2025 numbers are tallied.</p>



<p>That's an increase to <strong>$197 billion</strong>, with mobile games expected to grow to  <strong>$108 billion (a 7.7%</strong> <strong>increase)</strong>, console gaming expected to hit <strong>$45 billion (a 4.2% increase), </strong>and PC gaming expected to grow to <strong>$43 billion (a 10.4% increase)</strong>. The PC and mobile growth is what exceeded Newzoo's expectations, and the key drivers behind the expected growth getting to just shy of $200B, though, if growth continues in the way Newzoo predicts, the industry will be far past $200B by next year.</p>

<p>While Newzoo expects mobile to remain strong due to its stock of ol'reliable titles from publishers like Tencent and Century Games and the momentum perpetuated by new hits, much like how the console industry is kept up by the routine and habits of console gamers going back to major franchises each year, growth on PC is a bit more interesting. </p>



<p>That's exemplified in the top 10 games on PC by revenue for the year. Some of the games are major franchises, but none of them are free-to-play titles, and all of them are games that were released in 2025. "<em>The 2025 outcome reflects players spending more deeply within games and ecosystems they already value, rather than growth being driven by a sudden expansion of the player base</em>," said principal market analyst, Michiel Buijsman.</p>

<p>Two of the top 10 are indie titles, and three of the top 10 are brand new games not based on a pre-existing franchise on PC, which Newzoo says is "<em>reflecting a broad appetite for varied experiences</em>" and <em>"PC's relative openness to new IP and system-driven design</em>." It's also further signs that, while console games may take centre stage more often as far as what hits the mainstream, PC is still where the core industry is. </p>



<p>On console, the top 10 does clear one of the same bars that the PC list clears, which is that they're all games released in 2025, but none of them are indie titles or new franchises. They're all major franchises, and half the list are even annual releases. </p>

<p>EA is the winningest publisher with nearly half the list in its portfolio, though perhaps the most impressive inclusion is Pokemon Legends Z-A, which made it despite only being available on one platform.</p>



<p>Both of those lists are tallied by revenue, whereas the engagement lists (tallied by monthy active users) for PC and console are a different story. Only one of the titles in the top 10 on PC isn't based on a pre-existing franchise, while all of the games on the console list for the top 10 games by MAUs are major franchises.</p>



<p>As a side note, the top 10 console games by MAUs is in fact the only list in Newzoo's report where Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 makes the top 10. Battlefield 6 is still in that top 10, and made it on every the revenue and MAU list for both PC and consoles. It's still early of course, but at this point it feels safe to call it: Battlefield beat Call of Duty in 2025, and there's practically no question about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, the final key points from Newzoo's report, as it looks back at 2025 and towards the future to 2026, is that indie games were a huge factor in this year's industry conversation, largely due to successes like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which capped off its stellar year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">winning a record number of awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year</a>. </p>



<p>And as we look ahead, 2025's most significant moves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">like EA moving to privatize</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's opening of Vantage Studios</a> mean that the industry is going through a massive shift. "<em>The EA deal reflects a broader structual shift toward ownership concentration and tighter portfolio management,</em>" said Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo.</p>



<p>"<em>A smaller number of companies now control a larger share of the industry's most influential IP, while platforms increasingly shape which games are funded, distributed, and scaled</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune Awakening Chapter 3 Brings ‘Bigger, Better’ Endgame, New Content and Lots More, Says Funcom]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has unveiled Dune Awakening Chapter 3, an upcoming update for its survival crafting game set in the world based on Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's movies.</p>



<p>Dune Awakening launched in June 2025 on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling one million copies in a couple of weeks</a> and becoming Funcom's fastest-selling game release to date. However, it was quickly evident that there wasn't enough content, and a lot of players left the game after a short while.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Game Director Joel Bylos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me</a> the team wasn't worried, as the core is among the best games in the genre and it just needed more content and fixes. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a>, that's exactly what Funcom plans to add to Dune Awakening, starting with Chapter 3.</p>



<p>First and foremost, the developers aim to deliver a 'bigger, better' endgame, powered by a comprehensive redesign of the Tier 6 experience. Players will find deeper progression choices and more meaningful advancement paths, thanks to specializations dedicated to Crafting, Gathering, Exploring, Combat, and Sabotage. This will allow non‑combat focused players to progress endgame content without forced PvP or dungeon raiding.</p>



<p>The Landraad system, Dune Awakening's server-wide political system where player guilds align with the Great Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen), complete weekly tasks, and vote on decrees that affect everyone on the server, has reportedly been remade from scratch and now features new repeatable missions, expanded reward tiers, and stronger incentives for participation. The Faction ranks progression has been extended, too. There will be new contracts specific to each faction's objectives (Atreides, Harkonnen, independent groups). </p>



<p>A completely new Augmentation Station is being introduced as an upgrade path for late‑game gear customization. Players will be able to attach powerful augments to Unique Tier 6 gear to customize their playstyle further. On the PvE side, Funcom is adding five brand-new overland 'challenge sites', including 'The Broodworks'. Completing these areas provides faction progress, increases Landsraad contribution, and grants Specialization XP. Furthermore, Dune Awakening Chapter 3 will introduce five new Testing Stations. These are repeatable, dungeon-like content featuring boss fights, increasing difficulty and appropriately valuable rewards. </p>



<p>The story is going forward, too. The player's narrative journey will continue with the introduction of unexpected allies, fighting through the Neo Carthag dueling ring, and delving deeper into the mystery of the player character's origins. When it comes to combat, the Rapier is being fully reworked, and a new 'Pyrocket' melee weapon (dual-wielded knives) will be available with the update.</p>

<p>Alongside Dune Awakening Chapter 3, Funcom will launch the paid Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, which can be purchased for $9.99 (but is included with the $24.99 Season Pass). Its additions are cosmetic-only: 73 new building pieces and 17 decorations inspired by the Imperium's Smugglers, a dedicated stillsuit set, a light and heavy armor set, weapon variants, swatches, and emotes.</p>



<p>The game is available at a 35% discount, the largest one yet since launch, in the Steam Winter Sale that starts today. Funcom did not share a timeframe for Chapter 3 and the Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, but more details should be released in early 2026. Later next year, the game is supposed to launch on consoles as well.</p>
