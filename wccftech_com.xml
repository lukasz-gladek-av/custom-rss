			<p>Just as every week brings another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-amazon-fire-tv-app-reanimal-kingdom-come-deliverance/">GeForce NOW Thursda</a>y, we also get an <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/star-trek-voyager-styx-blades-of-greed-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">a new batch of games</a> adding support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation technology. </p>



<p>This week, two games are launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4:<strong> Styx: Blades of Greed</strong>, the return of the stealth-driven action adventure, and <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, a new strategy management game where you have to try to manage the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager and get the ship out of deep space and back to Earth.</p>



<p>Both games also arrive with support for NVIDIA Reflex and DLSS Super Resolution, which those with the NVIDIA app can upgrade to DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution. </p>



<p><strong>NORSE: Oath of Blood</strong> is another game that's launching this week with support for some of NVIDIA's DLSS technology, arriving with DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution. Once again, if you're using the NVIDIA app, you'll be able to upgrade to DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S later this week, though you can already check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/">Francesco De Meo's review of the goblin's return</a>, in which he gave the game a <strong>7.5/10</strong>, and also noted that while the game does suffer from a few technical issues, when you flip the switch for DLSS 4 with Mult-Frame Generation, those issues are smoothed out. </p>



<p>"<em>Despite the technical friction and a 20-hour runtime that becomes slightly repetitive toward the end, </em><em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> is a <strong>solid stealth title</strong>. It doesn't revolutionize the genre, and it lacks a much-needed in-game map for its sandbox maps, but it compensates with <strong>excellent level design and immense heart</strong>. For fans of the series or those craving a pure stealth experience, <strong>Styx's hunt for Quartz it’s a journey worth taking</strong>," writes De Meo.</p>
