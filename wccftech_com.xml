			<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially revealed today with a new trailer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The short trailer</a>, which can be watched below, uses the original consoles as a basis to show how the hardware will change in its next iteration with a bigger screen, different Joy-Con controllers, and more. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">previously rumored</a>, the new trailer doesn't provide much information on the games, showing only a seemingly new Mario Kart game that has yet to be officially confirmed, and confirming only that the system will be fully backward compatible with both physical and digital original Switch games. The trailer doesn't even provide a precise release window past the generic 2025 window, but thankfully, it seems we won't be left in the dark for a long time, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be aired on April 2nd.</p>

<p>Besides providing a better look at the new system in April, Nintendo also confirmed that in select cities around the world, players will be able to get hands-on with the system. These cities include New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto in North America, Paris, London, Milan, Berlin, Madrid, and Amsterdam in Europe, Melbourne in Oceaniakyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Taipei in Asia. Ticket registrations, which require a Nintendo Account, will open tomorrow, January 17th. More information on these hands-on events, including dates for each city, can be found <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Dallas-based game developer Stray Kite Studios announced Wartorn, an upcoming real-time tactics game with roguelite elements. It will be set in a fantasy realm devastated by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds and follows two elven sisters as they fight to survive and reunite with their family. Stray Kite promises tough decisions for players, such as deciding who gets fed or which lives can be saved, all while confronting the eternal moral dilemmas of violence and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Paul Hellquist (BioShock, Borderlands 2), Creative Director and Co-founder of Stray Kite Studios, said:</p>
<p><em>Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness. We’ve poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us.</em></p>
<p>Shovaen Patel (Orcs Must Die!), Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Stray Kite Studios, added:</p>
<p><em>Our vision for Wartorn is a game that seamlessly blends artistic expression, tactical depth, and emotional resonance. We want players to feel like every choice matters, both on the battlefield and in the story.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Wartorn - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, we're promised a dynamic combat system that emphasizes taking advantage of elemental forces like fire, water, and lightning. Players may ignite tar to engulf enemies, amplify electric shocks with water, or douse flames if it suits them. The environments are also destructible, ensuring additional layers of depth and unpredictability to the encounters. The roguelite-inspired progression will reward persevering players by offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that can be carried to the next run. There's also a slow-time feature that lets players pause combat and issue precise commands, adapting gameplay to suit their pace.</p>
<p>Visually, Wartorn adopts a peculiar painterly aesthetic that might not be to everyone's liking. We'll see what the reaction is from the public. The game is set to debut this Spring in early access via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store.</p>

			<p>Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida was featured in a lengthy video chat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Greg Miller of Kinda Funny Games</a>. Yoshida worked for over thirty years at Sony's PlayStation division, holding positions such as Vice President of Sony Computer Entertainment America, President of Sony Worldwide Studios, and later Head of the Independent Developer Initiative.</p>
<p>His tenure <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially ended yesterday</a> and that's also when the interview went live, diving into the executive's whole career. However, the most interesting part was discussing <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shuhei-yoshida-replaced-hermen-hulst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his replacement with Herman Hulst</a> as the head of the internal first-party studio organization. Shortly afterward, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed heavily into live service games</a> after many successful single player releases.</p>
<p>When asked if the new business strategy made sense to him, Yoshida replied that the resources were additive rather than replacing investments in single player. However, he also admitted he might have resisted that change in direction, and jokingly added that may have been why he was replaced.</p>
<p><em>I was managing this annual budget and was responsible to allocate resources to what kind of games to make. If the company was considering that way, it probably wouldn't have made sense to stop making another God of War or whatever, like a great single player game, and put all the money into these service games. However, what they did after I moved on and Herman Hulst took over is that they added a lot more resources. I don't think they told him to stop making these single player games. They said, oh yeah, these games are great. Continue doing that, and we give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I'm sure they knew it was risky and that the chance of a successful game in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company knowing that risk gave Herman the resources and the chance to try it. I think that's the way they did it, so in my mind I was, oh wow, that's great and hopefully some games will become successful. Luckily, Helldivers 2 did so well. No one would have expected it. You cannot plan a success in this industry, that's the most fun part</em>.</p>
<p><em>I thought if I was in the position of Herman, I would have tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me (laughs).</em></p>
<p>It was definitely a risky move for Sony with more than a few missteps, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Online</a> (canceled after Naughty Dog decided it wouldn't want to become a live service studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a> (shut down just a few days after launch with the subsequent closure of the studio). As Yoshida said, luckily there was one success, albeit the least anticipated among the bunch, with Arrowhead's Helldivers 2, which became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-selling PlayStation title ever</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least another major tidbit that's worth reporting from the interview: the executive's take on the whole Bloodborne situation. Fans have been clamoring to get a sequel or at least a remaster for years, but Sony and FromSoftware appear deaf to those cries. Here's what Yoshida believes is the main obstacle:</p>
<p><em>I have only my personal theory on that situation. I left first party, so I don't know what's going on but my theory is... I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, if Miyazaki is busy with an Elden Ring sequel, he certainly doesn't have time to work on Bloodborne 2. However, Sony has recently become the largest shareholder of FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Corporation. They might have more sway in choosing his next big project.</p>
