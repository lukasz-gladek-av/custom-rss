			<p>Visionary game designer and industry legend <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> was recently featured <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Nikkei Xtrend</a>, where he <span>discussed, among various topics, the enigmatic upcoming&nbsp;<strong>OD</strong>&nbsp;Project once again</span>. As translated and reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gamesradar</a>, Kojima teased that the most recent teaser trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a> includes a 'hint' of some kind that players can discover after watching it carefully again and again.</p>



<p><em>I can't say anything else, or Mr Phil will be mad at me. But actually, if you watch the teaser trailer many times there's a hint. I really can't say what it is, but if you watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer, it reads 'for all players and screamers'. That's also a big hint.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the Nikkei Xtrend interview, Kojima also reiterated that it is a 'completely new medium' that his studio built with the help of <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which is publishing OD, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-kojima-partnership-brand-new-game-cloud-powered-xbox-bethesda-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.</p>



<p><em>I think when you first see OD, it looks like horror. But the system it uses isn't ordinary. Everything is made in a game engine, and a game is a game, but it's still a system like no other. That's why we built a completely new medium together with Microsoft.</em></p>



<p>OD <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being co-written with <strong>Jordan Peele</strong></a>, a filmmaker known for his horror works, and will feature Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, who sadly passed away last month before he could complete his motion performance in the game.</p>



<p>We know that it will leverage Xbox's cloud gaming technology, but we don't know how. Last year, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that it was a risky project, and as of two weeks ago, he candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he still doesn't know if it will work out or not in the end.</p>



<p>OD is supposed to be the studio's next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and before <strong>PHYSINT</strong>, a new Metal Gear Solid-like stealth IP that will be made <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in collaboration with PlayStation</a>.</p>

			<p>Polyphony Digital's <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong> may have been released nearly four years ago, but according to series creator and studio founder Kazunori Yamauchi, it's still doing extremely well.</p>



<p>In an interview with media outlets that attended the Gran Turismo World Series 2025 World Finals in Fukuoka, Japan, the legendary game designer (and racing driver) revealed that the game <strong>is regularly played by over two million players each month</strong>, and perhaps even more importantly, its player base is still growing. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gt7-2-million-monthly-users-20251221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as GTPlanet reported it</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gran Turismo 7 has been released for several years, but still, the active users are currently over 2 million people, and the new users are increasing. The status that Gran Turismo 7 is in now is probably the best of any Gran Turismo titles that we’ve had in the past. We’ve never experienced this phenomenon before, and neither has PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Polyphony Digital experimented with live service in the previous entry, GT Sport, but it's clear that GT7 has received a much warmer welcome from series fans and continues to keep many players interested through various updates. The most recent one, Spec III (Update 1.65), launched on December 4 and introduced:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight cars (Ferrari 296 GT3 ’23, Ferrari 296 GTB ’22, FIAT Panda 30 CL ’85, Gran Turismo F3500‑B, Mine's BNR34 GT‑R N1 base, Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R ’97, Polestar 5 Performance ’26, and Renault Espace F1 ’95).</li>



<li>Two tracks (Yas Marina Circuit and Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve).</li>



<li>The new Data Logger feature lets players load data from the previous attempt or replays to view and compare data such as racing lines, throttle and brake inputs, speed, and engine RPM, all in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside Spec III, Gran Turismo 7 players can also purchase the new Power Pack for $29.99. This premium DLC adds 50 new races across 20 themed categories, such as 24-hour races, six unique cars specially tuned by Gran Turismo, tail-to-nose battles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-sophy-announced-by-sony-ai-and-polyphony-its-an-ai-breakthrough-capable-of-competing-against-top-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo Sophy</a> 3.0, and is bundled with 5,000,000 in-game Credits.</p>



<p>The game's only real downside is the aggressive microtransactions system, which also caused its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Wccftech review score</a> to drop from 9 to 8/10. From the point of view of PC players, there's also the 'downside' that the game still isn't available, whereas most other PlayStation exclusives have already been ported. </p>



<p>Three years ago, a Yamauchi statement about a PC version being considered <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was widely reported</a> in the press. However, a few weeks later, the founder of Polyphony rectified the statement, clarifying that the possibility was 'not zero' but that there was still nothing being actively done on that front yet. Unfortunately, as of the end of 2025, there are still no updates on the port.</p>
