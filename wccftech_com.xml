			<p>2025 saw the return of one of the biggest strategy franchises in the genre, a spiritual successor to a series that fans are dying to see make a comeback, and a beloved game get its long-awaited remake. There was plenty to fill our pick of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2025</a>, and if everything on our list below makes it out before the end of 2026, putting together 2026's list of the best strategy games and best simulation games shouldn't be an issue either.</p>

<h2 id="h-star-wars-zero-company-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars Zero Company (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Star-Wars-Zero-Company-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bit Reactor</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you wanted to give someone the elevator pitch for Star Wars: Zero Company, telling them 'It's XCOM but make it Star Wars,' would be enough to get any strategy game player with a mild love for Star Wars through the door.</p>



<p>We can't be sure if it'll be that exact of a match-up whenever Star Wars: Zero Company does arrive on PC and current-gen consoles sometime in 2026, but it has the precedent to be. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM developers, with the studio led by Greg Foerstch, former art director at Firaxis on XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns. With so much XCOM blood in the studio, it's exciting to think of the kind of gameplay and storytelling we'll get, all set within the Star Wars universe. Hopefully, it makes its proposed 2026 window, and we're playing it before the end of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ace-Combat-8-Wings-of-Theve.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">One of the bigger announcements of The Game Awards,</a> Bandai Namco's Ace Combat series is returning with Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve. It's not necessarily a jet flying simulator, but its simulation-style approach is what has it in our picks for what we're looking forward to from simulation games this year.</p>



<p>It's the first mainline entry in the series in seven years, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">2019's Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-7-3-million-copies-sequel-in-development/">gone on to sell over 3 million copies since then</a>. It may not be the best-selling series in Bandai Namco's portfolio, but there's a clear hunger for more Ace Combat and millions of players who will happily buy this new entry when it arrives. Hopefully, we'll know more about the game and its release soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-total-war-warhammer-40-000-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Total-War-Warhammer-40K.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Total War series is hitting a couple of 'firsts' with the coming release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000. It'll be the first time the Total War series makes the trip to the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, but perhaps more importantly for the series, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will be the first time the Total War series makes its way to consoles, as it is also set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with the help of David Harbour from Stranger Things, the coming game will feature the Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum as its four factions, and while it doesn't have an official release window yet, the announcement did include gameplay footage which hopefully means its far enough along that we could see it arrive in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-tbc-2026-pc">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Warhammer-40K-Dawn-of-War-IV.png"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV. Image credit: Deep Silver</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A second appearance from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, though this time it's coming from its own series of RTS games instead of a different franchise making its first foray into the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The long-awaited Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV was shown off multiple times in 2025, including with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/">an incredible-looking in-engine gameplay trailer</a> that made the game look like it was ready for release very soon.</p>



<p>It doesn't have an official release date or release window yet, but we'll hopefully be hearing more about it soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-nova-roma-march-26-2026-pc">Nova Roma (March 26, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nova-Roma.png"></a><figcaption><em>Nova Roma. Image credit: Lion Shield</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last on our main picks is Nova Roma, a new upcoming title from developer Lion Shield and publisher Hooded Horse, the latter of whom has made a name for themselves as having a keen eye for upcoming strategy titles. </p>



<p>This city builder asks you to appease the Roman gods and create a successful and thriving Ancient Roman empire, and if you feel like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> didn't scratch the Ancient Roman itch you have, then Nova Roma could be the game to do it. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Of course, we can't have every upcoming game in our main picks, but the following games are still worth paying attention to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[César-Winning Composer Amine Bouhafa Used an “Alien Instrument” To Help Capture the Frozen World of DON’T NOD’s Aphelion]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cesar-winning-composer-amine-bouhafa-used-an-alien-instrument-to-help-capture-the-frozen-world-of-dont-nods-aphelion/</link>
            <guid>1401061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>DON'T NOD has unveiled a new trailer for its upcoming game, <strong>Aphelion</strong>, at today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> which focused on the game's music and featured an interview with its award-winning composer, Amine Bouhafa.</p>



<p>You may have already heard Bouhafa's work in the 2021 short film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5030456/?ref_=fn_t_1">The Summit of the Gods</a> or in 2025's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28326501/">The Little Sister</a>, though this is the first time the <strong>César-winning</strong> composer is working on a video game. "<em>This is my first time working on a video game, and I loved the way that [the Aphelion team] thought about the music and about the game. I'm enjoying the experience</em>," Bouhafa said in a press release.</p>



<p>Bouhafa narrates the trailer while gameplay from Aphelion is shown, as he describes how he approached writing the score for his first video game and how he used what he described as an "<em>alien instrument</em>" called a Cristal Baschet to capture the cold and frozen world of the game. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Aphelion | A Musical Journey - Amine Bouhafa" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkTMEg1x6Qc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>It is an instrument that had been invented by the Baschet brothers in the mid-20th century. For me, it looks like an alien instrument. When you see it, you cannot even predict that it's a musical instrument</em>," Bouhafa says. Playing the Cristal Baschet involves dipping your hands in water and then running them along several crystal batons to create its sound. For Bouhafa, it was the perfect element to "<em>convey the frozen identity of the score</em>."</p>



<p>Bouhafa also talks about using the grand organ at the Saint-Eustache Church in Paris, which helped convey the bigger, grander, and sacred moments in Aphelion's narrative. It's all together an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how a major aspect of Aphelion is coming together. </p>



<p>DON'T NOD has suffered a string of commercial misses lately, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">last year's Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage missing expectations</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant both underperforming before that</a>. The studio does have a new game in the works with Netflix on top of Aphelion, which could prove fruitful, as it is based on "<em>a major IP</em>" within Netflix, but it'll be some time before that materializes into a full release - if Netflix even lets it get that far, since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">its willing involvement in video games seems iffy</a>, at best.</p>



<p>Aphelion is currently set to arrive sometime in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Ghost of Yotei, ARC Raiders and Dispatch Lead 29th DICE Awards Nominations]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/</link>
            <guid>1400959</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>29th annual DICE Awards</strong> are set for <strong>February 12, 2026</strong>, and the <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp">full list of nominees has been revealed</a>, with an unsurprising list of games leading the way in nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> lead the pack with <strong>eight nominations each,</strong> while <strong>Dispatch</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> tie for second place with <strong>six nominations each</strong>. All four titles are also nominated for the big prize, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>The DICE Awards are hosted every year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, with the nominees and winners picked by an academy of more than 30,000 members of the video game industry. Similar to the GDC Awards, this is an awards show that is chosen by the developers, and made for developers to celebrate each other's work and lift up the latest and greatest in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Basically, if you think that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a> are nothing but a popularity contest and that the games' media critics who make up the judging panel don't know what they're talking about and/or you think they're only focused on trailers for new games and not focused enough on the actual awards themselves, then the DICE Awards are what you'll want to pay attention to.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, four out of the five choices for DICE's Game of the Year appear on <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's Best of 2025 list.</a> </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable nominees include Blue Prince, which has five nominations, including one for Game of the Year, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which has four nominations. </p>



<p>Some of the major differences between the DICE Awards and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">other major awards shows</a> that've already passed are the fact that Hollow Knight Silksong and Hades 2 are left off the Game of the Year list, with the former getting only one nomination and the latter getting three. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 also came up short with only three nominations, and Donkey Kong Bananza got two.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-dice-awards-2025/">Last year's big winner was Astro Bot</a>, which took home five wins, including Game of the Year. Helldivers 2, Balatro, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle also came up with multiple wins, with four, three, and three awards each, respectively. </p>
