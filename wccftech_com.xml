			<p>One of the best narratives in gaming to come out of 2024, and one of the best games from 2024 that initially launched on PC and Nintendo Switch, is finally arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year. 1000xResist from the new Canadian indie studio Sunset Visitor will arrive on the rest of the current-gen consoles next month, on November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Also, for any Xbox players <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">who didn't rush to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions</a>, you'll be able to check out 1000xResist when it arrives on Xbox consoles through Game Pass.</p>

<p>1000xResist is set 1,000 years into the future, and sees you step into a clone named Iris when humanity is on the verge of its end. Iris is one of six sisters, and throughout the game's narrative, you peel back the mystery behind ALLMOTHER, the new ruler over the last remaining members of humanity, and unweave her web of lies.</p>



<p>At its heart, amidst all the sci-fi dressings, 1000xResist is a deep narrative about familial relationships and shared trauma, and was easily one of the best games to come out of 2024. It was nominated for several awards, though arguably was criminally overlooked compared to other indie titles that got a little more recognition last year.</p>

			<p>Grey State Studio is a new developer and a subsidiary of the massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">China-based publisher, Tencent</a>, and today, the studio announced its debut title which is due to arrive on PC sometime in 2026. Rules of Engagement: The Grey State is a free-to-play, first-person shooter set in a "<em>Horrorverse</em>" where you take on an ever growing list of nightmarish creatures in waves.</p>



<p>You'll have more to contend with than just monsters, though, as you'll also have to face off against other squads in this PvPvE shooter. You play as an unnamed operative only called Strider, with the singular mission of retrieving an artifact called 'The Vertex,' each time you step into The Grey State, the unstable and horrifying dimension where all the creatures and monsters can be found.</p>



<p>Grey State Studios released two trailers to debut Rules of Engagement: The Grey State, with the first being a cinematic reveal trailer, and the second being a first-look at gameplay trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The cinematic trailer does a solid job of setting the mood and tone for the horror shooter, while the gameplay trailer looks like an impressive foundation for what is just alpha build footage and not what the final version will look like. It also breaks down the different classes and abilities players will get to choose from each time they step into the twisted dimension of The Grey State.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The actual gameplay doesn't look like anything we haven't seen before in other shooters, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The most interesting aspect of this game so far seems to be its setting, and the idea that it could continue to expand to include monsters and creatures from a variety of horror icons.</p>



<p>For now, the game is currently only set to launch on PC next year. We'll see if PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles get added to the release lineup closer to it's actual release date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake and Until Dawn (2024) Reportedly Coming to PS Plus Extra This Month]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-and-until-dawn-2024-reportedly-coming-to-ps-plus-extra-this-month.1325347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-dautres-titres-dont-une-exclu-ps5-viennent-etoffer-le-catalogue-de-jeux-doctobre-2025-60636">Billbil-kun over at Dealabs</a> has leaked the headlining titles joining PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium for October 2025. As a follow-up to Alan Wake 2 headlining the PS Plus Essential games for October 2025, it looks like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake is joining the PS Plus Extra Game Catalogue, along with last year's new release of Until Dawn.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun had already reported that Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-rumored-coming-ps-plus-extra/">was set to join PlayStation Plus this month as part of the games entering at the Extra tier</a>, but this latest report adds the Until Dawn (2024) version to the list of games, alongside As Dusk Falls and V Rising. </p>



<p>It also includes two of the PS Plus Premium games joining the Classic's Catalogue this month, Tekken 3 and Tomb Raider Anniversary. All of these titles are also said to enter into players PS Plus Extra and Premium libraries next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>



<p>Both Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tekken 3 were previously announced as coming to the Classics Catalogue during PlayStation's last State of Play event, though we weren't given a date as to when they would arrive. Now, it seems like they'll both arrive in less than a week from the time of this writing.</p>



<p>All in all, it seems to be a solid lineup for the month of October, with plenty of spook-focused titles joining the PlayStation Plus service this month. If Billbil-kun's report is correct about the date, which is a fair assumption to make based on their reporting track record, then we'll likely have an official announcement from PlayStation if not later today, then before the week is out.</p>
