			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-sims-25-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Electronic Arts</a> is celebrating 25 iconic years of The Sims. This life simulation title has brought people to gaming that typically wouldn't go near games, allowing people to share their creativity and revel in the chaos and madness of Sims. It went from a very humble title with Comic Sans writing to one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with a million-lifetime players to date.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Sims, there have been some major drops, as well as news regarding updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/">The Sims 4</a>. First and foremost, The Sims 1 and Sims 2 were released as part of a Birthday Bundle celebration. While this news was exciting to most long-term Sims players, there have already been a host of issues, with the games just either not booting or constantly crashing. As a result, it's led to a frustrated community, with many of them refunding the games. The issues have been acknowledged, with the team dedicated to fixing them in future updates.</p>

<p>If you want to try your luck, The Sims and The Sims 2 are available via the EA app, Epic Games Store, and Steam for PCs running Windows 10 and 11.</p>

This will take you through a journey of nostalgia and memories while unlocking new items and content in your game by participating in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play The Sims FreePlay, there are special events to participate in with rewards, as well as 25 days of in-game gifts, which include some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history.</p>
<p>In the event you want some<a href="https://shopthesims.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tangible merch</a> that you can showcase in your day-to-day life, there is a limited edition merch collection that features retro pins, a 2000s-themed gamer mat, t-shirts, and more.</p>
