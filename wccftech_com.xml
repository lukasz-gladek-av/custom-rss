			<p>A few hours ago, Bokeh Game Studio announced the release of a free Slitterhead demo on all platforms. This demo lets players try out the game's first chapter (tutorial included), and its save data will carry over to the full game if they purchase it afterward. On that note, 30% discounts are now available on PlayStation, Steam, and Epic Game Store; there are no discounts for the Xbox version, though.</p>
<p>In addition, the physical PS5 Day 1 Edition, which is distributed in North America by XSEED Games, is now available at a $10 discount off the MSRP of $59.99. It includes a physical copy of the game, a CD with original songs from the game composed by Akira Yamaoka, an art book with over 100 pages of gruesome details, and a sticker sheet, all packaged in a custom outer box.</p>

<p>There was a fair amount of anticipation for Slitterhead ahead of its release, mostly because the game has been designed by Keiichiro Toyama, the legendary creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, among other games.</p>
<p>However, the game wasn't received as well as Bokeh Game Studio hoped for. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/slitterhead-three-nights-kowlong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated just 6.3 out of 10. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about his experience with Slitterhead:</p>
<p><em>For Bokeh Game Studio’s inaugural title, Slitterhead is such a strange anomaly to try and recommend over the other horror games that have topped 2024’s list of new releases. Those intimately familiar with Keiichiro Toyama’s general vibes would gladly find some enjoyment in his new studio’s new IP, but it can be tough to recommend for fans who haven’t already been lured in with the premise of a playable Wong War-Kai experience. Slitterhead is an experience that's fantastic in still shots or in story trailers but the actual gameplay becomes a muddled mess when the player is forced into repetitive chase and combat sequences.</em></p>

			<p>Game developer and publisher Maximum Entertainment has announced a new first-person sniper simulation game titled Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi. It was developed in collaboration with Brandon Webb, a former SEAL Sniper course Head Instructor, to achieve a realistic gaming experience. As a SEAL sniper, you'll navigate high-stakes environments, operate lifelike weapon systems, and rely on your skill to complete dynamic, high-stakes objectives under pressure.</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to conduct advanced training in long-range shooting in various environmental conditions that influence the elevation and wind compensations. They'll also get to master tactical techniques such as milling, stalking, and creating hides.</p>
<p>They will perform authentic interactions with their sniper rifles, from manual scope adjustments to bolt operation and a full suite of ballistics influenced by weather, distance, and ammunition types.</p>
<p>Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi takes place in the titular city located in the Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Here, players will explore anything from urban enclaves to open farm grounds, with locations inspired by real operations made by the SEAL team. Mission types will include&nbsp;Special Reconnaissance, Area Surveillance, Overwatch, and High-Value Target neutralization.</p>
<p>Maximum Entertainment promises 'endless replayability' thanks to emergent events such as ambushes and IED discoveries. The game also supports an online cooperative mode where players team up with a spotter to communicate, strategize, and control the battlefield. While one player focuses on communications, intel, and firing solution calculations, the other executes high-stakes precision shots with no room for error. Over the course of the game, it will be possible to unlock new weapon systems, attachments, and equipment.</p>
