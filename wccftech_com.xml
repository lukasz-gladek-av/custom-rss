			<p>Black Friday has arrived even for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. This week only, GFN users from the free tier (or even newcomers) can upgrade to either Performance or Ultimate memberships for a three-month subscription at half the normal price. This means you'll pay $4.99 monthly for the Performance tier and $9.99 monthly for the Ultimate tier instead of the usual $9.99 and $19.99. As a reminder, the Performance tier is the rebranded Priority tier that was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-upgrades-geforce-now-middle-tier-but-introduces-100-hour-monthly-playtime-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> a resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p. However, NVIDIA also announced plans to introduce a 100-hour monthly playtime cap starting January 1, 2025 for new customers, while every active paid number as of December 31, 2024 will be able to continue avoiding the cap until January 2026, provided that they maintain an active subscription.</p>
<p>As part of the Black Friday deals, GeForce NOW members can also redeem a 30% discount from SteelSeries to purchase the <a href="https://fave.co/4idOI7x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stratus+</a> or <a href="https://fave.co/3Zd0h6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nimbus+</a> controllers for Android or iOS devices, respectively. To redeem the discount, opt-in to GeForce NOW rewards and look out for an email with details. Do note that this exclusive offer cannot be combined with other SteelSeries promotions.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a GeForce NOW update without some new games added to the ever-growing list of over 2K compatible titles. This week, players can start enjoying the following games on NVIDIA's cloud:</p>
<p>● New Arc Line (New release on Steam, Nov. 26)<br>
● MEGA MAN X DiVE Offline Demo (Steam)<br>
● PANICORE (Steam)<br>
● Resident Evil 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour Demo (Steam)<br>
● Slime Rancher (Steam)<br>
● Sumerian Six (Steam)</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a hands-on preview of the steampunk fantasy cRPG New Arc Line earlier this month, following the game's debut on early access.</p>
<p><em>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. However, you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm eager to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</em></p>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 continues its solid sales performance. The game developed by Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=space+marine+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units within a day of its debut (considering pre-orders, of course) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out</a> to be the second best-selling game launch of the year in Europe. Less than three months later, the studio <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/119-november-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Space Marine 2 broke the milestone of five million copies sold, which proves that the game was well-received among the notoriously picky Warhammer 40K fans.</p>
<p>Saber also took the opportunity to reveal to the community that Patch 5.0 would be released in the first half of December, which means in the next couple of weeks. The update will add a new PvE co-op Operation called Obelisk, in which players must rotate a replica of the Obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This Operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p>
<p>To reach the console control of the obelisk, players must venture through a dark tomb. It will be even more challenging due to a new addition to the Chaos roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy. They will now appear in every PvE Operation featuring Chaos.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also getting a big customization improvement with the next update. Color lenses have finally been added, allowing players to customize between fifteen colors. Moreover, the patch will also bring the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, adding the unique armor set Dark Angels Champion as well as three themed weapons and one themed shield (for the Bulwark class).</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Patch 5.0 will introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation, bumping frame rates across the board on PC.</p>

<p>Saber also told fans to look forward to Titus's story continuing in Amazon's Secret Level Prime Video series, which will feature a dedicated Space Marine 2 episode. To celebrate the event, they will activate special Twitch Drops between December 10 and 31.</p>
