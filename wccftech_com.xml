			<p>This morning, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with TBS TV to create a game based on an original intellectual property. TBS is one of five private broadcasters and is mostly known as the home of Ninja Warrior (known as Sasuke in Japan), a sports/reality show where a hundred participants compete in a four-stage obstacle course.</p>
<p>Here's the translated press release, which does not provide any details on the game itself (likely still in the concept phase):</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Co., Ltd. aims to continue to provide new experiences and value that will remain in the hearts and minds of customers around the world through its content and services, based on corporate philosophy of "Creating new worlds with limitless imagination. Under the new medium-term management plan, the Square Enix Group is working to deliver to customers a rich variety of content with solid appeal through the creation of new IP, the development of new business models, and the multifaceted development of IP.</em></p>
<p><em>TBS Television Inc. aims to be the starting point that moves society by delivering heart-stirring moments in a variety of fields. TBS' brand promise is to "create the world of tomorrow with the best of time. With this brand promise, we are taking on the challenge of pioneering digital content and growing into the global content brand "TBS". As part of these efforts, in July, we will launch our own game business brand "TBS GAMES" and focus on the creation of original IP originating from games. </em></p>
<p><em>Square Enix and TBS have decided to collaborate on the development of a completely new original IP game for both domestic and international markets, combining the experience and strengths they have cultivated in their respective fields. We hope you will look forward to the new original IP will be created by combining the knowledge of both companies in the entertainment field.</em></p>
<p>Considering the history of Square Enix, this could be a roleplaying game of some kind, but it's really too early to tell. However, we'll keep an eye on any news in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-77-8-million-units-shipped-sony-forecasts-further-decrease-in-unit-sales-for-fy2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter financial report</a>, we learned that PS5 shipments have reached 77.8 million units to date. In the last quarter, Sony only shipped 2.8 million units of the PlayStation 5 console, a significant decrease from the 4.5 million units shipped in Q4 FY 2023. Full-year PS5 sales are also down: Sony sold 18.5 million units in fiscal year 2024, down from the 20.8 million consoles sold in fiscal year 2023.</p>
<p>Sony also shared the forecast for fiscal year 2025, and the expectation is that PlayStation 5 hardware sales will decrease even further. However, this will be offset by first-party software sales, which are expected to increase with the release of titles like Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on October 2</a>.</p>
<p><em>FY2025 Forecast (year-on-year)</em><br>
<em>◼ Sales: 370.0 billion yen (8%) decrease</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Decrease in sales of hardware due to a decrease in unit sales</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Impact of foreign exchange rates</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of non-first-party game software titles including add-on content</em><br>
<em>◼ OI: 65.2 billion yen（16%) increase</em><br>
<em>·(+) Impact of increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, even this year's PS5 hardware sales decrease was largely offset by software sales on PS4 and PS5, which increased from 2023's 286.4 million units to 2024's 303.3 million units. However, most of them were for third-party games, whereas first-party game sales decreased from 39.7 million units to 28.9 million units year-over-year. The digital download ratio of full game software sales on PS4 and PS5 rose from 2023's 70% to 2024's 76%.</p>
<p>Sony also highlighted the 5% year-over-year increase in Monthly Active Users (MAUs), which rose from Q4 2023's 118 million to Q4 2024's 124 million. Admittedly, there's the fact that some PC games now <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-pc-specs-are-out-and-theyre-quite-demanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require access to the PlayStation Network</a>, which wasn't really the case last year. This could have contributed to the higher figure registered in 2024.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster of the classic 2014 puzzle game, and not just because of the Unreal Engine 5 boost it gave the graphics. It added a whole new expansion on top of the original game and the Road to Gehenna DLC, a prequel to the game's story called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for players to solve, and what makes it and The Talos Principle: Reawakened particularly special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of these 18 puzzles</a> were designed in collaboration with members of the game's community, people who had been making puzzles themselves for the last decade because they loved the game and its mechanics.&nbsp;Which also explains why these puzzles are some of the most difficult ones to solve across the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Conundrum Cascade puzzle. However, if you just want a hint before reading the full solution, then what I'll say is, don't forget to use the ladders. I think if I said anything more, I'd give away too much.</p>
<p>If you want me to give more away, read on for the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Conundrum Cascade Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the hexahedron and both connectors</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you need to get the hexahedron that's behind a shield on the right side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan that is on the ground and in front of a pressure switch right in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the hexahedron and place it on the pressure switch in the middle of the puzzle area when you walk into the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent in front of the hexahedron, and use it to fly up into the air to grab the first connector (C1). Drop back down to the ground with C1 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C1 to the red laser generator in the middle and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan and place it on the vent that was sitting behind the shield that is now deactivated by C1. Grab the hexahedron and let the fan launch you into the air onto the platform in the middle of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the left-most pressure switch to activate the vent and fan next to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Launch yourself to a smaller platform where you'll find a switch that will keep the shields blocking your path to the ladders permanently deactivated. Flip the switch, and jump down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>For this next part, you can either use the fan to launch yourself back up to the taller platform in the middle of the puzzle area, or climb the ladder, but the point is you need to get back up there, and drop the hexahedron and the fan that was already up there down to the ground. Collect the hexahedron, both fans, and C1 together. Place one fan on the vent, then place the hexahedron on top of that fan, with C1 on top of the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the other fan down on the pressure switch so the hexahedron and C1 are flying in the air.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder to climb up to the top of the platform and grab C1 and the hexahedron. Place the hexahedron next to the window on the right side of the platform, and then connect C1 to the red laser generator and the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use either of the fans to deactivate the first shield with the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area, and grab C2. Bring C2 into the middle of the puzzle area before you put it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you've acquired all the tools you need to actually go ahead and solve the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase Two - Go for the solve</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to the red laser generator and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent. Grab the other fan and launch yourself and the fan back up to the platform in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent at the top of the middle platform. Grab C1 and place it on the left-most pressure switch to activate the fan. Pick up the hexahedron to launch yourself and the hexahedron to the smaller platform on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, and jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red node on the opposite side of the wall that's on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder, or use the fan to launch yourself back up to the middle platform. Grab the fan off the vent, and drop down to the ground, and place it on top of the vent that's on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area. Grab the other fan and place it down next to the pressure switch on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder leading up to the smaller platform, and grab the hexahedron. Place it on fan overtop the vent and then place the other fan on the pressure switch to have it flying through the air. Head up the ladder to put the hexahedron back on the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator and C2, then place it on top of the hexahedron like you did earlier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use the ladder leading to the shorter platform to step on the pressure switch, so the laser can pass through and hit C2. Once C2 activates the node behind the wall, you can step off the switch with the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent next to C2. Grab the other fan and launch yourself, with the second fan, up to the middle platform. Place the fan on either of the two pressure switches to the right of the pressure switch that activates the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and stand next to C2. Pick it up, and for the final time, launch yourself to the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C2 to C1, and to the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Place it down on the pressure switch next to the switch you placed the fan on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The fan and C2 standing on their pressure switches will deactivate the shield at the top of the middle platform, allowing the laser to pass through and hit the node to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Jump down to walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how to solve the Conundrum Cascade in the new In the Beginning expansion that came with The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
