						<h5>Infinity Nikki</h5><p><span>December 5, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Typically, I don't do gacha games. The way they work just doesn't gel with me, as I don't want to get sucked in and end up spending money on it, especially when there are tons of other games that I can play where I don't need to spend money to get ahead or be better in the game. Luckily, Infinity Nikki's gacha system is pretty fair compared to some of the others on the market right now. For the most part, there isn't a bad thing I can say about Infinity Nikki, as it is much like the games I used to play when I was younger and loved dress-up games. As an adult, this brings back many feelings of that childhood joy I experienced and allows me to get sucked into a cozy world full of whimsy and color.</p>
<p>To play this game on PC, you must download the independent launcher or play it via the Epic Games Store. I <span>chose to use the&nbsp;<a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent launcher</a> because I find that games launched through the Epic Games Store just don't run well at all for me, possibly because the launcher is not</span> optimized. Of course, the game is also available on PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Although I knew that the former Director of Zelda, <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">Kentaro Tominaga</a>, was working on Infinity Nikki, it still shocked me just how, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it was not just in the sense of the grand exploration, but also from the trials that you can undertake to get Whimstars. The aesthetic of the trials, in particular, is very reminiscent of those from Tears of the Kingdom, especially ones where you have to use your Purah Pad to be able to get from point A to point B.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-000539.png"></a></figure>

<p>The atmosphere and the aesthetic of the game is breathtaking. Even when you approach the first Warp Spire in the game, the location you get it at is so well decorated and bursting with vibrancy and realism. It's hard not to play Infinity Nikki and take a ton of pictures. Even if you aren't taking pictures of the costumes you unlock for Nikki, there is so much beauty in the surrounding world, especially once you start to progress through the story and discover new locations.</p>
<p>Even without doing the questing, I found myself getting lost in the expansive world, collecting materials that I could use later on to craft new dresses. I've always loved games where I can collect resources and hoard them, and Infinity Nikki allowed me to do just that. Every flower and herb was immediately pocketed, and I continued on my journey.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there wasn't much about Infinity Nikki that I&nbsp;<em>didn't</em> like. The game was magical and everything that younger me would have dreamed of. It definitely appealed to the inner child and allowed me to reminisce about days when I would play dress-up games online. Most controversially, the one character I didn't like was Nikki's sidekick, Momo. They were reminiscent of Paimon from Genshin Impact, and both have voices that I just don't like. Compared to Paimon, Momo was significantly more tolerable but still a touch annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about Infinity Nikki was the game's performance. Admittedly, I do have a pretty powerful PC that I play it on, but when it comes to Unreal Engine 5 games, they don't have the best reputation for how they perform on PC specifically. For example, Silent Hill 2 was a game that ran terribly for me, even after many patches. However, Infinity Nikki felt like a breath of fresh air with how well it ran, even on Ultra settings. Once I got to the central city, the game was a little bit laggy, so I turned the settings down, and it improved significantly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-181551.png"></a></figure>

<p>Florawish was a particularly great city to explore, and I loved being able to climb up buildings, stand on the peak, and look over the people and terrain below. There wasn't a single part of it that wasn't teeming with life and vibrancy, and it was the perfect game to slow down, stop, and smell the roses. There's a lot of exploration to do in Florawish alone, with there being hidden chests in nooks and crannies that you may not even spot unless you're traversing the rooftops. It was fun trying to find everything, and I'm sure even now, I've missed a ton of stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, Infinity Nikki is a fantastic experience and is well-optimized, considering it's made in Unreal Engine 5. I had a lot of fun with the game, and I can't wait to see what is added to it with new updates. My main issue is the fact that you can't change the key binds. As someone who is left-handed and suffers from dexterity issues in my hands, I find that using a controller becomes painful after a while. I would love the option to change the key binds to make the experience more comfortable and streamlined.</p>

			<p>With 2024 nearly gone, Saber Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500560232665055477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a community update on the Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 for 2025. The developer acknowledged the fans' cries for more PvP content, and they plan to deliver next year, starting with a new PvP map set in a closed environment with plenty of tight corridors, forcing players to engage more often in closed-quarter battles.</p>
<p>Patch 7.0 will also see the addition of custom PvP lobbies, another community request. Users will get to tweak various modifiers and change the number of players (up to 6v6), the timer limit for each match, the maximum score limit, and even to remove the limitation of having more than two players for each class in the same match.</p>
<p>Of course, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also being expanded with more PvE content, such as the previously announced Horde mode. Additionally, there will be new missions and enemies, a new difficulty level (linked to new rewards), and a brand new Prestige Rank. The latter feature will be introduced in Season 3, allowing players to further upgrade their classes.</p>
<p>When it comes to new Champions, the next addition is the Salamander, a Sniper character available in both PvE and PVP. Saber explained that the Sniper could have just as easily belonged to the Raven Guard, but they have other plans for that Space Marine Chapter.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/a62bc19a1e9e19f11e45fce9f8375b8a7e275d7f-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The developer will also add more customization, like the Mark VI Corvus, and continue to expand the Battle Barge. Next year, a new area called Data Vault will be opened, featuring unlockable information on most enemies from the game. Players can unlock them with a special currency earned through in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Following the game's debut in September, Saber Interactive has been pumping out patches for their game. The Obelisk update <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-dlss-3-fsr-3-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two weeks ago, adding the titular PvE co-op Operation, support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 on PC, and support for PlayStation 5 Pro on console.</p>
<p>The aggressive roadmap isn't surprising, given that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has been one of the most successful releases of 2024 with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units sold as of late November</a>. Saber clearly intends to continue striking the iron while it's hot, keeping the fanbase glued to the game for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the game is included in our shortlist for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best shooter of 2024</a>.</p>

			<p>Many great platformers were released this year, but one in particular stole the show. This list will compile some of the greatest platforming games released this year if you want a game that's fun for all the family or seek to introduce someone to gaming. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five best platformers of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a></em></p>

<h2>Astro Bot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">9.3/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that Astro Bot is on top. The game was well-received by critics and users across the globe, and many got to go on a journey of nostalgia and celebrate Sony's expansive lineage. Compared to Astro's Playroom, Astro Bot is a fully thought-out game where you get to jump, climb, glide, and fly across expansive levels while saving bots that are cameos from Sony's iconic games. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face.&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h2>
<p>For fans of the Sonic franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was a dream come true. Although fans initially thought it was going just to be a simple remaster, it is evident that the game is much more than that and provides more content than players expected. Not only did the graphics receive a massive boost and give more detail than ever to both Sonic and Shadow, but it seems that a bit of Sonic Frontiers rubbed off on the game, too.</p>
<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is a great title if you want to introduce your children to gaming or get them to love the Sonic franchise, too. There may be some difficult moments, but you can always step in and complete the boss fight for them if they're struggling a lot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Mario vs. Donkey Kong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-vs-donkey-kong/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It isn't all that shocking that a Nintendo game has made it into one of the top spots for best Platformer of 2024. If there's one thing that Nintendo does best, it's this genre. Mario vs Donkey Kong was released in February this year.</p>
<p>For those who played the original, this may serve as a sweet hit of nostalgia. For those new to the game, it's still a fun time all around. This game has plenty of value for money, too, as you can play through over 130 levels, experiencing the classic platformer in a new light. Here's what Nathan Birch said in Wccftech's review:</p>
<p><em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong may lack the razzle dazzle of its stars’ more recent games, but this remake still has the power to hook players with its tried-and-true retro platforming and a finely-tuned difficulty curve that culminates in some challenges that will truly test your mind and reflexes. Those who have played the original Mario vs. DK to death may not find quite enough new content here, but lapsed fans and new players are in for a barrel of fun.</em></p>
<h2>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey was a fantastic game that was first released in 2010 on the Nintendo Wii. Fast forward 14 years, and we have now experienced the remastered release of Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's a fantastic game and a great way to introduce youngsters to gaming. It takes you on a journey through Disney's forgotten history while you get to wield a paintbrush to help you traverse the terrain, as well as utilize your paintbrush to take on bosses in the world.</p>
<p>For what it is, the game is a pretty great remaster of a Disney classic title and will provide a lot of nostalgia for those who played and loved the original. Some systems were improved, while others fell behind a little bit. While it is a fantastic game, it's undoubtedly no Astro Bot and does have some flaws that may make the game a bit tiresome after a while.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Plucky Squire (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-plucky-squire-a-zelda-love-letter/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the perfect game if you want to introduce young children to gaming. While some of the mechanics may seem a little bit complicated at first, it's very easy to get the hang of and really accessible. When it comes to platformers that were released this year, The Plucky Squire is incredibly unique in the way it tackles traversal and movement through the game.</p>
<p>It's more than just a platformer, though, as there's also fun combat to engage in, a storyline to experience, and lots of collectibles to discover as you solve puzzles. The game is a lot of fun and great for anyone of any age.</p>
