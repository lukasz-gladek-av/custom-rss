			<p>These rumors came after an awkward accident happened when sending around a marketing email regarding World of Warcraft's latest activities. However, the most surprising part that had people getting their hopes up was a link to join <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/">Game Pass</a>, with a subject line that read as the following: "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" Screenshots of this email were posted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox subreddit</a>, where there is no denying World of Warcraft was added to the advertising, and it certainly didn't seem like it was accidentally, either.</p>

<p>With this email beginning to circulate, this led to a lot of excitement and buzz about the potential of World of Warcraft being added to Game Pass, and the wishes that the game would also be launching on console. However, hopes were quickly dashed by Microsoft, after they gave an official reply on X.</p>
<p>"This was a mistake on our end. Sorry for the confusion! Blizzard's World of Warcraft was accidentally included in a Game Pass email even though it's not available with the service - a correction email will be sent to those who got the original email soon."</p>
<p>Of course, the replies under this post were quickly filled with people pleading with Microsoft to just add World of Warcraft to Game Pass already, with some even saying that they've already tested the game on the controller and found that it worked just fine.</p>
<p>The images that were added to the promotion in this email were very suspicious, as it didn't appear to just be a case of accidentally mentioning the game. As seen on the Xbox subreddit, it included promo material for the Plunderstorm event, with art from World of Warcraft combined with the classic Xbox and Game Pass theming.</p>
<p>While it may seem that World of Warcraft isn't coming to Game Pass any time soon, the email definitely is suspicious and will most likely continue to cause a stir for a little while, despite Microsoft putting out their official reply.</p>

			<p>The upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game has been unveiled, with Resolution Games showcasing DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. This game has been made in collaboration between Resolution Games and Wizards of the Coast, to bring newcomers and veterans together to enjoy a world that will immerse you in the lore of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Resolution Games' has used its award-winning Demeo Action Roleplaying System to help create this title, to provide players with the atmosphere and intense battle they need to really fit into the world of D&amp;D. Below is the official announce trailer for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cypwLhY8BP4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"By leveraging the power of the Demeo system, Resolution Games is able to take a different approach to Dungeons &amp; Dragons by putting the emphasis on fast turn-based combat and pick-up-and-play mechanics," says Eugene Evans, SVP of Digital Strategy &amp; Licensing at Wizards of the Coast. "BATTLEMARKED continues <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/">Hasbro's strategy</a> to leverage our extensive catalog of world-class IP to create digital games through licensing and internal studio development."</p>
<p>Compared to the typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED is a DM-less system with a focus on social strategy instead of focusing on social roleplay. Doing this encourages table talk that is focused on tactics and decision-making rather than building a personality for the characters in roleplay situations.</p>
<p>DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED will support cross-platform co-op play of up to four players, with two story-based campaigns when the game launches, with additional campaigns in a variety of D&amp;D settings to be planned as downloadable content in the future.&nbsp; This game will be available on multiple platforms when it's released. For now, you can keep up to date by keeping your eye on <a href="https://battlemarked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>, where they will release information accordingly.</p>
<p>"With the launch of Demeo back in 2021, we began to grow an incredible relationship with the D&amp;D player community. Demeo and Demeo Battles quickly became a game night substitute for Dungeon Masters who wanted an out-of-campaign way to have fun with their groups and for D&amp;D players to introduce their friends and family to tabletop miniatures games," says Tommy Palm, Founder and CEO of Resolution Games.</p>
<p>Demeo is still incredibly popular and used frequently, and if you haven't already, you can try out <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo</a> and <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeobattles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo Battles</a> on most gaming devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-trailer-drops-for-phantom-line-a-co-op-shooter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new trailer has dropped for Phantom Line, which is set to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-line-is-a-stunning-paranormal-swat-co-op-tactical-fps-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-developers/">1-4 player co-op shooter</a> that takes place in a post-nuclear European continent. However, it's not your average shooter, as you will be tasked with searching for anomalies. Anomalies are paranormal activities that are hidden from the public eye. You have to find them while searching an open-world map where many dynamic events will take place to shake up the gameplay.</p>
<p>In this title, you work as an elite spec-op unit for Mortfield Industries. You've been chosen for the Operator Simulation Program called H.U.S.K, where you can take your consciousness and place it into an artificial body. By doing so, you can use the H.U.S.K.s to your advantage, using them to scout the area, distract enemies, be a decoy, and many other tactics that can help you survive while tracing the anomalies.</p>
<p>This is all taking place in a world where Nuclear war has just broken out, and you are sent off to the Iron Corridor, which is an Eastern European area that has been devastated by international tensions. In order to survive, you need to be able to be self-sufficient and improvise when the situation arises. This includes using resources around you, getting better gear, as well as hunting and cooking animals to make sure that you stay healthy on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Below is a trailer for Phantom Line, where you can see all the action unfold. Additionally, if you're interested in playtesting this game, you can do so by joining <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Discord</a>, where you will be able to receive a key and try the game out for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - New Playtest Available NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYJk7C22eeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as fighting off enemies and trying to find anomalies, there will also be an Icebreaker ship that will serve as your base. From here, you will be able to customize your H.U.S.K., as well as your cabin, where you can show off all of your weapons and armor to your friends. This will also be the place where you can modify your loadout, including your gear and body.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for Phantom Line, and they are still working on getting the game to run at a stable 30fps at 1080p. You can keep up to date with the team via Discord or the updates they post on Steam by wishlisting the game if this is something you are interested in.</p>
