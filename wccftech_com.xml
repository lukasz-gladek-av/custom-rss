			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod, now available online introduces a highly requested feature that can make the game more enjoyable for users who have lamented the lack of a feature that has become a standard in the past few years.</p>



<p>The Minimap mod developed by paboyafx and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/383?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, does exactly what its simple name indicates: it adds a fully functional minimap to the game, complete with multiple zoom multiplier options ranging from 0.35x to 3x. As the level design of the amazing role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive can get a little confusing at times, this simple mod can be a godsend for those who want to explore the game's locations in their entirety and don't want to rely on old-school methods to avoid getting lost.</p>



<p>To be completely honest, I did not feel much of a need for a minimap in my time with the game, and had tons of fun relying on the environment to avoid getting lost and exploring locations the best I could. This sort of approach to exploration further enhanced what is,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"> in my opinion</a>, one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years.</p>



<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Although <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> spices up the formula of its predecessor in a lot of interesting ways, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions is still all about reconnecting a world that has been torn apart by the devastating Death Stranding. However, reestablishing the connection between different cities and shelters is only the beginning of the work Sam can do to bring people together, and the more effort you put into doing this, the more you are rewarded.</p>



<p>After connecting a city or a shelter to the Chiral Network, the<strong> Connection Level</strong>, represented with stars on the game's interface, will be at a very low level. If you only want to experience the game's story, you can easily ignore this mechanic and proceed from one place to another as the story dictates. However, if you want to expand the traversal and combat options at Sam's disposal, you will want to increase this Connection Level by completing Standard Orders, Aid Requests, and delivering Lost Cargo scattered all around. Doing so, however, can be hard work, so, are the rewards you get for maxing the Connection Level worth it? It depends on your playstyle.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>By playing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach normally and mostly ignoring any side deliveries, you should have no trouble hitting at least Connection Level 3, which will usually unlock an upgraded variant of a weapon or tool unlocked after reaching Connection Level 2. At Connection Level 4, you will get another upgraded variant, which is usually a significant improvement over the Connection Level 3 upgrade. At <strong>Connection Level 5</strong>, however, <strong>you won't be getting anything substantial</strong> unless you are into cosmetics, as maxing out a Connection Level with most cities or shelters will reward you with a new Custom Hologram and Patches. In the case of <strong>Villa Libre</strong> in Mexico, <strong>The Lone Commander</strong> and <strong>The Pizza Chief</strong> in Australia, you will also get some additional rewards that aren't of the cosmetic variety, so it may be worth it to max out their Connection Level even if you aren't into cosmetics or unlocking everything the game has to offer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-%E2%80%93-how-to-fast-travel.1231566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At its heart, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an open-world game like many others, but the new entry in the series developed by Kojima Productions, much like its predecessor, sets itself apart from how it handles mechanics that are seen in other similar games. One of these mechanics is the ever-convenient fast travel option, which has become more and more of a necessity for an open-world game as maps and worlds continue to become bigger.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,<strong> the fast travel option is not available from the beginning of the game</strong>, and will only be unlocked after <strong>defeating the giant BT mech during Order 12 in Episode 3</strong>. After taking down the mech, connect West Fort Knot to the Chiral Network, and after a few cutscenes, you will have unlocked the fast travel option. To travel instantly to a place that is deemed safe, mostly cities and other locations that have already been connected to the Chiral Network, all you need to do is <strong>open the map via the Ring menu, hold the X button to Chart a Course for the DHV Megallan and select an available location marked by a blue icon</strong>. You can pick any location deemed safe on any continent, so fast traveling is a convenient way to go back to Mexico and improve your relationship with the first characters Sam connects with at the start of the adventure.</p>



<p>For a game that is most all about traversal, having a fast travel option may make much of its traversal mechanics pointless, but that is not precisely the case here. If you have cargo to deliver to any location where you can fast travel, if you do use the option, you will get the Magellan evaluation, so if you're looking for the best possible evaluation, you will still have to make your deliveries the old fashioned way.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenway%E2%80%99s-actor.1231509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has been practically confirmed by Matt Ryan, who voiced protagonist Edward Kenway in the original game. </p>



<p>Ryan, who also played DC's John Constantine in various live action and animated shows, spontaneously <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/1939392046151926243">told</a> a fan the following when signing autographs at a convention:</p>



<p><em>Have you beaten the game? Well, you may have to beat it again. Especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything.</em></p>



<p>The first time we heard about the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake was exactly two years ago, when Kotaku <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/">reported</a> that Ubisoft planned to modernize the fourth mainline installment in the series, originally launched in 2013. Interestingly, that report also mentioned that Ubisoft Singapore would be helping the Montréal studio in crafting the remake. This makes sense, as Black Flag's excellent naval combat and exploration mechanics inspired Ubisoft Singapore's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull and Bones</a> game.</p>



<p>In October 2024, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">revealed</a> that the project was even further in development than previously thought. Ubisoft originally planned for Assassin's Creed Shadows to be released in late 2024 and the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake in November 2025, but the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 2025 also impacted the remake, which is now likely to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Even so, we might not be far from an official announcement, especially with Matt Ryan teasing it so openly. Chances are it may be revealed at a dedicated Ubisoft event or, more likely, between Gamescom Opening Night Live and The Game Awards 2025 in December.</p>



<p>How excited are you for the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake? Let us know in the comments!</p>
