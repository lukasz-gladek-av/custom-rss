			<p>Playground Games has revealed the PlayStation 5 launch date for its award-winning game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>. The latest installment in the open world racing game franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will debut on Sony's console</a> on April 29, although owners of the Premium Edition will be able to start roaming the Mexican country roads from April 25. Playground Games also revealed the technical details of this version, including the planned improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 features two rendering modes to choose from: Performance (60fps) and Quality (30fps). On PS5 Pro, the Performance mode receives increased visual fidelity, while Quality mode adds ray traced car reflections to Races and Free Roam.</em></p>
<p>The launch on PlayStation 5 coincides with a major update called Horizon Realms, which will be available on all platforms. This new feature aims to let players immerse themselves in the history of the game's Evolving World updates. In Horizon Realms, players will get to explore twelve Evolving World locations: eleven of the best previously limited-time locations and the first-ever Stadium Track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting new Horizon Realms exclusive awards will unlock four new Horizon Reward Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Lamborghini Revuelto</li>
<li>2023 Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato</li>
<li>2018 Lotus Exige Cup 430</li>
<li>2022 Hennessey Mammoth 6x6</li>
</ul>
<p>Playground has discussed two ways to experience Horizon Realms. In Skill Mode, the Forza Horizon 5 user picks one of the Realms to enter and try to get as many Skill Scores as possible. Each Evolving World will have its own Skill Score Leaderboard, and there will also be an overall Skill Score Leaderboard that adds up all the points you have banked on each Realm. Earning enough Skill Score will also unlock new player badges unique to Horizon Realms.</p>
<p>In Free Mode, leaderboards are cast aside to focus on the fun factor. &nbsp;having fun on their favourite realms. Players can drive solo or with friends, earn badges tied to previous content updates, and unlock accolades to earn #Forzathon points.</p>

<p>As a side note, it's possible April will be a month to remember for PlayStation 5 users when it comes to Microsoft game releases. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tom-warren-indiana-jones-for-ps5-is-targeting-an-april-release.1120953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, MachineGames is aiming to launch the PS5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in April, though that might still change.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now.1120992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-572-60-fix-black-screen-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a new GeForce Game Ready driver</a> optimized for the latest NARAKA: BLADEPOINT update. The highly popular melee focused free-to-play Battle Royale game by 24 Entertainment now supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, allowing players to achieve astounding frame rates on the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>
<p>Leading the pack is the flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. According to NVIDIA benchmarks, it can run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at an average of nearly 600 frames per second (yes, you've read that right) at 4K resolution and maximum graphics settings with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. That's a massive uplift compared to the admittedly still more than sufficient 150 frames per second that the card can achieve without DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The GeForce RTX 5080 achieves only a little more than half the average frame rate of its bigger sibling, 312 frames per second. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is fairly close at 255 average frames per second. At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen lets GeForce RTX 50 owners run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at even more mind-boggling frame rates: 737, 536, and 450 FPS at 1440P and 933, 727, and 642 FPS at 1080P.</p>
<p>The latest game update also optimizes character grappling hook resources to provide a smoother experience when using it. In-game 'loot memory' was also optimized, improving memory recovery after combat to reduce memory consumption. Content-wise, 24 Entertainment added a new hero called Ziping Yin to the Showdown mode.</p>

<p>NVIDIA also revealed that the new DLSS 4 plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to game developers, allowing them to access the latest and greatest transformer models for optimal image quality.</p>
<p>As a roundup of the latest PC game releases with integrated DLSS technologies, the racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is out with support for Frame Generation and Super Resolution, while the roguelite first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287150/Revenge_of_the_Mage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenge of the Mage</a> launched last month in early access with Super Resolution support.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will debut with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and ray-traced reflections; on the same day, PGA TOUR 2K25 will be released with DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
