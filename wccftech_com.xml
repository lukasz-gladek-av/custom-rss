			<p>Activision has debuted a first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Zombies with a new cinematic trailer that introduces the cast of characters for the narrative this year, ahead of more to come with Call of Duty Next at the end of the month.</p>



<p>As it's a cinematic trailer, there's no gameplay, but it does showcase the Ashes of the Damned map somewhat, and shows how all eight characters come face to face for the first time.</p>

			<p>Today, publisher A Plus announced the Western release date of the free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. The game will be available in Europe, North America, and South America via PC (Steam, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blue-protocol-star-resonance-27bff9?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-protocol-star-resonance/id6744962482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpsr.apj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>) starting October 9. The studio had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-october-mobile-pre-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game would be released in October, but now fans have the exact day.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Blue Protocol was originally developed by Bandai Namco Online Studios. It launched two years ago in Japan,&nbsp;only on PC. Amazon Games was supposed to&nbsp;publish&nbsp;the game for PC and consoles in Western countries, but it was completely unsuccessful in Japan and&nbsp;was thus <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down</a>, seemingly preventing the Western debut as well.</p>



<p>However, earlier this year, developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-lives-again-will-launch-this-year-on-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the game rights to launch Blue Protocol: Star Resonance for PC and mobile devices, effectively reviving the project.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are some differences between Star Resonance and the original game, though. Firstly, the business model, which was supposed to be buy-to-play and is now free-to-play with gacha monetization system. On the upside, Shanghai Bokura Network Technology created a seamless open world environment, whereas Blue Protocol had segmented explorable zones, and also added traversal mechanics like gliding.</p>



<p>The action combat system is faster-paced now, featuring more complex boss mechanics and a detailed endgame with PvE raids. The original's hybrid class roles have also been overhauled into a stricter MMO-like "holy trinity" (tank, support, damage). Finally, the narrative is different as well.</p>



<p>For now, there's been no mention of a console launch, but that does not mean it will not happen in the future. Of course, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance would have to succeed on PC and mobile first before the developer and publisher could consider an expansion to console platforms at a later time.</p>
