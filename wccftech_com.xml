			<p>Where Winds Meet launched last week globally on PC and PlayStation 5 after being available in China for roughly one year, and it is widely considered one of the best free-to-play open-world RPGs on the market. The game is good enough that even someone like me, who is completely averse to the free-to-play model,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/"> enjoyed it quite a bit</a>, also thanks to the fact that the gacha mechanics that have become synonymous with this sort of game are limited to cosmetics.</p>



<p>Having no interest in these, I did not pay much attention to what Where Winds Meet offers in terms of cosmetics. However, the game developed by Everstone Studio has a huge variety of offerings, including something that could only be described as excessive. A digital luxury boat that can cost up to around $70,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-mirage-boat-an-excessive-status-symbol">The Mirage Boat: An Excessive Status Symbol</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/someone-spent-up-to-70k-dollars-on-a-boat-in-free-to-play-where-w/za89de">Gamepressure</a>, the Mirage Boat is the most expensive mount in Where Winds Meet, which allows players to travel over water and host other players for some fancy parties. While it's easy to see the appeal of such a cosmetic and the e-fame and attention it can bring, the potential price of the digital collectible can make anyone's jaw drop.</p>



<p>Some users over on the Where Winds Meet subreddit attempted to calculate exactly how much the Mirage Boat costs for the single Chinese player who owns one at the time of writing. The mount requires 170 Mirage Torn Pages to unlock. These pages are exchanged from the Draw Shop for Harmonic Cores at a 1:1 ratio, and these cores are obtained via the Celestial Draw Banner. As it requires roughly 150 draws at around $400 to get a single Harmonic Core, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p1hmtp/68k_for_a_boat/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">getting a Mirage Boat can cost as much as $68,000</a>, or as little as<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1ojax09/is_this_ship_really_40000/"> $40,000</a> if one's lucky with their draws. Still, a considerable amount of money for an item that ultimately has little value, even in gameplay terms within the Where Winds Meet experience.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-cost-of-digital-vanity-a-car-a-real-boat-financial-freedom">The Cost of Digital Vanity: A Car, A Real Boat, Financial Freedom</h2>



<p>Although there's no denying that anyone is free to do whatever they wish with their own money, it's difficult not to think about what this Where Winds Meet player could have bought instead of a digital collectible whose only value is to let the owner become the envy of other players. </p>



<p>Funnily enough, as soon as I discovered the maximum possible cost of the Mirage Boat, the first thing that came to mind was how 15, 20 years ago, one would buy a fancy car or even a small boat to become the envy of their peers, where I grew up. And this is precisely what the owner of the Mirage Boat could have bought if they had indeed spent close to the $70,000 maximum estimate:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">An SUV or Sports Sedan</strong>: With $70,000, you can buy a brand-new, near-luxury SUV or a well-equipped performance sedan from major manufacturers. It’s a price range that covers many premium models.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A Real Boat</strong>: $70,000 is enough to purchase a solid used powerboat or an entry-level cabin cruiser, something that can take you out on the water for real trips and recreation.</li>
</ul>



<p>The up to roughly $70,000 that may have been spent on this digital collectible, which could become useless if the game’s online service ever shuts down, becomes an even more baffling figure when one considers what else this money could be used for. A generous down payment for a mortgage, eliminating debt, starting a business, or investing in education are definitely more worthwhile and tangible pursuits.</p>



<h2 id="h-digital-validation-in-the-modern-age">Digital Validation in the Modern Age</h2>



<p>While games like Where Winds Meet can continue to exist partly thanks to players like the new owner of the Mirage Boat, it's concerning to consider the psychology behind such an extreme purchase. For this specific player, the boat’s worth isn't in its function; it's in its scarcity and high visibility. In the world of Where Winds Meet, this collectible is a fleeting status symbol that can fade away in an instant, underscoring the far-reaching consequences of pursuing validation, even in digital worlds.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/corsair-void-v2-max-wireless/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/corsair-void-v2-max-wireless-hands-on-%E2%80%93-the-differences-that-actually-matter.1365091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It’s been a couple of months since<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/corsair-void-wireless-v2-review-lightweight-competitor-with-great-battery/"> I reviewed the original Void Wireless V2</a>, and it’s still the headset I grab when I want something light that just works across everything I own without fuss. Corsair has now launched the Void V2 Max at around $149 (currently on sale for $119.99), and after running the two side-by-side for the last few weeks, the upgrades are clear but not drastic.</p>



<p><strong>Build &amp; Comfort</strong></p>



<p>Physically identical: 303 g, same mesh ear cups, same 90-degree swivel, same flip-up mic. The Max adds slightly denser foam and a bit more padding around the drivers for better passive isolation, enough that background noise fades a touch more in quieter game moments. Everything else (clamping force, glasses compatibility, heat buildup) is the same. If you already like the V2 fit, the Max feels like the same headset with a marginally better seal.</p>



<p><strong>Audio Performance</strong></p>



<p>Same 50 mm drivers on paper, but the Max gets a proper Dolby Atmos tuning pass and a bundled Sonarworks SoundID license. Imaging is wider and more precise, mids are a little cleaner, and the personalised EQ profile from SoundID is surprisingly effective once you run the quick test. The original V2 could do Atmos through Windows or the Dolby app, but it never felt this intentional. Mic quality is effectively identical—clear for comms, nothing special for streaming.</p>



<p><strong>Battery, Charging &amp; Platform Switching</strong></p>



<p>Battery life remains excellent on both (~70 h on 2.4 GHz, 120+ h on Bluetooth). The Max adds proper fast charging: 15 minutes for roughly six hours of use. What still sets the entire Void V2 line apart—and what I genuinely appreciate every single day—is that one dongle and one headset cover PC, PlayStation 5, and now Xbox Series X|S (with the Xbox-specific variant of the Max) without ever touching a switch on the dongle itself. No A/B sliders, no mode buttons, no re-pairing. Plug the dongle into whatever platform you’re on, and it just connects. Then, if you need to hop to your phone or Switch, hold the power button two seconds and you’re instantly on Bluetooth. Hop back to the console or PC and it reconnects to the dongle in under a second. The pairings are permanent; the switch is seamless. The Max is a hair faster on the reconnect, but the standard V2 was already miles ahead of anything else in this price bracket. One headset, one dongle (or none on Bluetooth), zero hassle across Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch, phone—whatever. It sounds basic until you’ve lived with competitors that make you choose a platform and stick to it.</p>



<p><strong>Price &amp; Recommendation</strong></p>



<p>The original V2 now sells for $110–120. The V2 Max is $149 (and cheaper during sales). You’re paying the difference for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Properly tuned Dolby Atmos + SoundID</li>



<li>Fast charging</li>



<li>Slightly better passive isolation</li>



<li>Continued best-in-class single-dongle multi-platform support (now officially including Xbox on the dedicated variant)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you already own the V2, keep it—95 % of the experience is identical. If you’re buying new and you bounce between consoles and PC (or just want the cleanest Atmos implementation Corsair has ever shipped in this line), the Max is the obvious pick. Same ridiculously versatile wireless ecosystem, just refined where it counts.Solid, common-sense evolution. That’s exactly what I want from a “Max” version.</p>

			<p>The sequel to the critically acclaimed soulslike<em> </em>Lies of P will not disappoint players, according to director Choi Ji-won.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/i-will-not-disappoint-you-lies-of-p-director-promises-the-most-fun-as-neowiz-prepares-a-sequel-to-one-of-the-best-soulslikes-ever-made-says-the-overture-dlc-was-treated-almost-as-a-sequel-anyway/">GamesRadar+</a> after winning the <em>"Best Game Expansion"</em> award at The Golden Joystick Awards 2025, the director of one of the best soulslike ever released, not developed by FromSoftware, commented on the future of co-developers Round8 and Neowiz, assuring players that what's in the works will not disappoint.</p>



<p><em>"You can expect the most fun that we can achieve within the game,"</em> Choi Ji-won said, asking fans to <em>"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all."</em></p>



<p>Although the director did not specifically discuss the sequel, the timing and context of the recent award naturally draw attention to the continuation of the Lies of P<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> </em>series, rather than <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-making-lies-of-p-sequel-but-also-making-another-new-soulslike-new-narrative-rpg/">the other projects in development at Neowiz</a>. The expansion, released earlier this year, was developed as if it were a sequel, so it will be very interesting to see what the next entry in the series delivers and how it achieves the level of fun Choi Ji-won teased.</p>



<p>The Lies of P: Overture DLC definitely deserved the<em> "Best Game Expansion" </em>award at The Golden Joystic Awards 2025. Although it doesn't feel significantly different from the base game, it masterfully expands its core features to deliver an engaging experience that makes it easy to overlook its sometimes unfair challenge level.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, the Embracer Group <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-arc-games-and-cryptic-studios-while-several-key-rights-are-retained-within-the-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the divestment of developer Cryptic Studios and publisher Arc Games, which are being acquired by a new company called Project Golden Arc, Inc., thanks to funding from XD Inc. Project Golden Arc, Inc., is owned and led by members of the Arc Games management team. Cryptic Studios is a Californian developer known for MMORPGs like City of Heroes, Champions Online, Star Trek Online, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/magic-legends-missed-the-mark-and-will-shut-down-on-october-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defunct Magic: Legends</a>, and Neverwinter, which just received the new Red Harvest Part II - The Soul Collector module.</p>



<p>The sale is expected to generate net cash proceeds of $30 million for the Embracer Group. Additionally, the parties have stipulated that the Group will maintain the publishing rights for the Remnant franchise, which are being transferred to the internal label THQ Nordic, which already owns the Remnant IP rights and the development studio, Gunfire Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-4-announced-will-feature-all-four-horsemen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently busy with Darksiders 4</a>). </p>



<p>Moreover, the publishing rights of the 'MODA (Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure' game Fellowship are being transferred from Arc Games to the Embracer Group's Coffee Stain division, which is expected to be spun off from Embracer and listed on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market in Stockholm, with the first day of trading planned for 11 December 2025. Arc Games will continue to be listed as co-publisher of the game.</p>



<p>Developed by the Stockholm-based studio Chief Rebel, Fellowship was released on PC via Early Access on October 16, 2025. Chief Rebel will continue to develop the game, with a team of around 35 people working towards the full version, which is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. You can read our exclusive interview with the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Fellowship is currently 20% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> through December 4.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade developer SHIFT UP has announced the signing of a publishing deal with Tencent's Level Infinite for their upcoming game codenamed Project Spirits.</p>



<p>The press release mentions that this will be a cross-platform game developed on Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles and mobile. It is being co-developed between SHIFT UP and Yongxing Interactive, an affiliate of Tencent. </p>



<p>This partnership marks the second global collaboration between Level Infinite and SHIFT UP, following the successful global release of GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE. Both companies are committed to achieving even greater synergy with Project Spirits than with their previous venture and, as part of this process, Level Infinite and SHIFT UP have reportedly strengthened their strategic partnership to encompass publishing and joint development.</p>



<p>The South Korean studio's first hit was indeed the mobile game GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE, but it was Stellar Blade that propelled it to global renown. </p>



<p>Last week, SHIFT UP <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the sequel would be a multiplatform release that launches on multiple consoles, unlike the first installment which was published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The original game earned a 9/10 score on Wccftech:</p>



<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve off-putting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>Two Bungie leakers have come out publicly to say that Bungie has begun work on Destiny 3. The first to do so <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1993425004281639083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was Bungie_Leaks</a>, a former leaker who stopped posting leaks a few months ago to avoid legal troubles with the developer. However, in this case, they are reposting information that was originally shared by another X user, <a href="https://x.com/starsiza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starsiza,</a> whose tweets are protected (meaning they can only be seen by those who have been approved). Beyond the Destiny 3 rumor, the tweet also mentions that 'something like a Destiny 2 classic game' has been greenlit, which the leaker claims is also the reason the D2 roadmap was recently delayed.</p>



<p>Around five hours later, trustworthy Bungie leaker Colony Deaks/Deakstiny <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the report with the following tweet</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Destiny 3 is in extremely early development. Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in such an early state, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. We plan to share more info in the coming months as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.</em></p>



<p>When a follower asked about the other part of the original rumor (the one about a Destiny 2 Classic), Colony Deaks <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993526382517985702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they currently have a lot of info on that front but are still working to confirm it.</p>



<p>Clearly, though, the big rumor here is Destiny 3. It's no secret that Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been registering all-time low players on Steam</a> after the launch of the Edge of Fate expansion. A couple of weeks ago, Bungie owner Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $204 million impairment loss caused by lower-than-expected Destiny 2 sales.</p>



<p>Perhaps this convinced both the developer and its parent company that the only way to reignite interest in the sci-fi franchise is to create a brand-new installment. Indeed, this seems to be the dominant sentiment within the community, with many former players vowing to only return if and when Bungie launches a new entry.</p>



<p>Granted, this is not the first time we've heard rumors about Destiny 3. The first ones stretch all the way back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-starting-development-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2018</a>, and then again <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, just ahead of The Final Shape expansion that concluded the ten-year-long Light and Darkness saga. Just a few months later, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a third chapter was never in development up to that point. Bungie had been working on a different Destiny experience codenamed Payback, with original Destiny creative directors Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy leading, but that got canceled and the two developers left the studio. Bloomberg's report also said that the new strategy was to release smaller 'experience packs'. However, by now it's quite clear that this is not working, which might have forced them to reconsider. </p>



<p>Even if Destiny 3 is now really a thing that's secretly starting to take shape at the developer, it'd have a long road ahead of launch, given the current average triple-A game development cycle. We might not hear anything concrete for three, four, or even five years, so Destiny 2 is likely to keep going for a while longer.</p>



<p>On that note, Destiny 2 is getting the Star Wars-inspired Renegades expansion on December 2, and Bungie has just released a ViDoc and a launch trailer, as covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>The PC version of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a> in the United States, suggesting that its launch is near. An official announcement may well come at The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley's show which features both awards for the best games of 2025 but also plenty of announcements for upcoming and existing titles. The Game Awards 2025 airs on Thursday, December 11.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the ESRB rating also reveals that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on PC, just as it was for the PS5 version. It's a change from the first game, which was published on PC by 505 Games. This is also surprising because Kojima Productions bought the publishing rights back from Sony and could have technically self-published this sequel. However, it may be that the studio doesn't yet have the necessary expertise or resources to self-publish, and as such, they are still relying on their partner, Sony. It'll be interesting to see whether the game ever makes it on Xbox like the previous installment and if so, if SIE will still publish there.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating is M for Mature (17+) with Blood and Gore, Partial Nudity, Strong Language, and Violence highlighted by the board. It's the same rating as the PlayStation 5 version, although that's not a surprise, as the content is likely to be identical.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26, 2025, for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling an estimated 1.4 million units in June</a> and earning more widespread acclaim than its predecessor. In the Wccftech review, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online.</em></p>
