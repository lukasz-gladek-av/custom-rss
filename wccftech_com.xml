            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The FIA World Rally Championship has <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">announced</a> that Nacon will once again be in charge of publishing WRC video games with the official FIA World Rally Championship license after it had previously gone to Codemasters and EA. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/codemasters-wrc-license">Codemasters purchased</a> the licensing rights to make its own series of WRC games in 2020, which began with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-roadmap-officially-revealed/">EA Sports WRC 2023</a>, launched on November 3, 2023.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, EA was supposed to have the rights to make WRC games from 2023 to 2027, but for whatever reason, either EA or the WRC decided to end the partnership after just one game. Prior to Codemasters' purchasing the WRC licensing rights, Nacon had published the previous seven WRC games, all of which were developed by French developer Kylotonn, which Nacon acquired in 2018.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">Codemasters confirmed</a> it would be "<em>pausing development plans on future rally titles.</em>" With today's announcement that the WRC license is back in Nacon's hands, we know why.</p>
<p>"<em>We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter,</em>" Nacon chief executive officer Alain Falc said in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans. Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship's official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights</em>."</p>
<p>The new deal between the FIA World Rally Championship and Nacon gives Nacon the rights to make WRC games for the 2027 to 2032 seasons, which means that Nacon will likely take the next two years to develop the new WRC series announced with this news. According to the press release, this new series is "<em>aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon</em>," said FIA World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks. "<em>Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-vr-mod-released-by-luke-ross/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Virtual reality modder Luke Ross has <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/were-eternally-129851027?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new R.E.A.L. VR mod to bring DOOM The Dark Ages to VR devices. To have access to it, you'll need an active subscription to his Patreon at the VR Friend tier, which costs $10 monthly. Of course, this would also provide you with access to all of Luke Ross's prior VR mods, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-vr-mod-coming-thanks-to-modder-luke-ross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-vr-mod-by-luke-ross-is-now-available-to-patreon-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dark Souls, Death Stranding, and more. The modder had previously released VR ports of Take-Two's Mafia: Definitive Edition, Grand Theft Auto V, and Red Dead Redemption 2, but a DMCA takedown notice from the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/vr-modder-luke-ross-gets-dmca-notice-for-his-rdr2-gta-and-mafia-vr-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced him to take those down</a>, to the great disappointment of the VR community.</p>
<p>As usual with his mods, VR gaming YouTuber Bearded Banjo was able to check out the new DOOM The Dark Ages Mod beforehand and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AaIs90I3gY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an enthusiastic video report of himself playing</a>. Bearded Banjo described the experience as 'fast, frantic, and sometimes overwhelming'. The mod supports head tracking and head-based aiming, but motion controls are unavailable, so you'll have to stick with using the gamepad. Banjo said the gameplay was captured on a PC equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 while using a Quest 3 connected via wired link.</p>
<p>The experience was smooth overall, even though he couldn't get NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to work with the mod for the time being. This could be fixed in a future update by Luke Ross. As a side note, the VR modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/score-one-for-129841705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the results of his experiments with <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-how-you-can-run-amd-fsr-4-on-basically-any-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optiscaler</a>, which is a great boost to those wishing to play his VR mods on an AMD GPU:</p>
<p><em>Thanks to that mod, in almost every game that supports DLSS upscaling, you can substitute AMD's FSR implementation and have it run effortlessly on AMD hardware. But from the game's point of view, the video buffers will still be produced in DLSS format, and that means that my R.E.A.L. VR mod can intercept them and fix the disocclusions by translating the calls to work in stereoscopic mode, thus getting rid of the shimmering around nearby objects and NPCs.</em></p>
<p>You can read our DOOM The Dark Ages review (non-VR) <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-reaches-3-million-players-7x-faster-than-eternal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 3 million player milestone much faster than DOOM Eternal. However, the jury is still out on whether it was financially more successful, as most of those are likely to have played the game on Game Pass. According to Ampere Analysis estimates, over two million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-than-2m-doom-the-dark-ages-launch-players-were-on-xbox-only-500k-playing-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked out the game on Xbox</a> while player numbers on PC and PlayStation 5 were around half a million, definitely lower than anticipated, at least on the PC platform.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft Quebec has published the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows' next title update, 1.0.5, which will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27, 2025.</p>
<p>The update makes the 'Thrown to the Dogs' quest, which was previously only available for players who pre-ordered Shadows, available to all players. It also includes a collaboration event between Assassin's Creed Shadows and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/">Dead by Daylight</a>, with an entirely new Dead by Daylight-inspired quest.</p>
<p>Ubisoft teases the premise of the quest in the patch notes, but doesn't get into specific details. "<em>As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima</em>," the patch notes read. "<em>To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics in order to confront a formidable otherworldly threat...</em>"</p>
<p>There's also a much smaller collaboration with <a href="https://wccftech.com/balatro-gets-four-new-cosmetic-collaborations-in-new-update/">Balatro</a>, which doesn't add a Balatro-themed quest but a new trinket for Naoe and an amulet for Yasuke that are both inspired by Balatro.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also made two key improvements to the game's parkour system. Now, when you're climbing up or down a building, so long as the directional inputs don't change, you will continue to sprint without having to re-engage sprinting. Also, Naoe and Yasuke can now vertically jump up to grab "<em>any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall runs</em>."</p>
<p>There are also a number of features that have been added to the game's Photo Mode, like being able to alter the time of day for a photo or save custom filters. And, as with any major patch, there's also a slew of bug fixes across multiple aspects of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sonys-days-of-play-sale-will-reportedly-kick-off-this-week-includes-ps5-and-ps5-pro-discounts-console-bundles-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 26/05/2025:</strong> Shortly after Dealabs reported the European sale prices for PlayStation hardware like the PS5 Pro and PS VR2 for the Days of Play sale, Insider-Gaming reported the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-playstation-days-of-play-2025-discounts-united-states/">US</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-days-of-play-2025-discounts-uk/">UK</a> prices for the consoles.</p>
<p>According to Insider-Gaming, in the US, the PS5 Pro will be $50 off from its regular price, so it'll go from $699.99 to&nbsp;<strong>$649.99</strong> for the Days of Play sale. The PS VR2 is also getting a $50 price cut in the US for the sale, on both the standard version of the headset and the bundle version that comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain. Both will be&nbsp;<strong>$349.99</strong> during the sale.</p>
<p>In the UK, the PS5 Pro is being cut by&nbsp;<strong>£45</strong>, and will go from its regular £699.99 price to&nbsp;<strong>£654.99.&nbsp;</strong>The base PS5 console, both the standard edition with a disc drive and the digital edition without a disc drive, are getting a&nbsp;<strong>£90</strong> price cut.</p>
<p>So the standard PS5 will go from £479.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£389.99</strong>, and the digital edition PS5 will go from £429.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£339.99.&nbsp;</strong>The PS VR2 is also getting the same&nbsp;<strong>£45</strong> price cut as the PS5 Pro, bringing it from £399.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£354.99</strong> for the standard edition of the headset and the previously mentioned Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle.</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2025-voici-un-apercu-sur-les-dates-et-promotions-du-prochain-evenement-playstation-60170">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Sony is due to launch its Days of Play sale this coming Wednesday, May 28, 2025, which will include the first discount for the PS5 Pro, discounts for base PS5 consoles, bundles that package Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with a PS5, and more.</p>
<p>Regarding Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 console bundles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ps5-bundles-are-reportedly-coming-soon/">Billbil-kun reported earlier this month</a> that those bundles would be on their way, and this latest report adds that they'll be revealed <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-des-packs-ps5-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-60177">alongside</a> the rest of the Days of Play sales this week.</p>
<p>If the price of the PS5 Pro has kept you from buying it, then this sale might not exactly change your mind. According to Dealabs, the price of the PS5 Pro is only being slashed by <strong>€50</strong>, while the base PS5 is getting a <strong>€100</strong> price cut for both the standard edition of the console that comes with a disc drive and the digital edition that doesn't come with a drive.</p>
<p>PlayStation VR2 is also getting a small price cut, and just like the PS5 Pro, PlayStation is only taking €50 off the price of its current-generation VR headset.</p>
<p>Here are all the hardware discounts that will be part of the Days of Play sale, per Billbil-kun and Dealabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard Edition (with disc drive): <strong>€449.99&nbsp;</strong>instead of €549.99</li>
<li>PS5 Digital Edition (without disc drive):&nbsp;<strong>€399.99&nbsp;</strong>instead of €499.99</li>
<li>PS5 Pro:&nbsp;<strong>€749.99</strong> instead of €799.99</li>
<li>PS VR2:&nbsp;<strong>€399.99</strong> instead of €449.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, players looking to grab extra controllers will be able to do so as a "<em>selection</em>" of DualSense controllers will be on sale for&nbsp;<strong>€54.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Beyond the hardware sales, the Days of Play sale usually includes a litany of software sales, both for PS5 games and Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service. There's no exact word on what those will look like at the time of writing, but we'll know soon enough, as Dealabs claims the sale will be fully revealed tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Half-Life 3 Will Be The Last Entry in the Series – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-will-be-the-last-entry-in-the-series-%E2%80%93-rumor.1198875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The yet-to-be-announced Half-Life 3 could finally bring the series' story to a conclusion, which wouldn't be a bad thing, everything considered.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/half-life-3-rumor-last-game-trilogy-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, the third main entry in the series will also be the final one, according to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/half-life-129859708?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DanielRPK</a>, as Valve wants to leave the series behind. Given the conclusion of the second entry in the series and the decades it will eventually take its successor to release, this is definitely not a bad thing.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK's track record is not spotless regarding video game leaks, there's a good chance that what they have revealed about Half-Life 3 is true, considering what other known Valve leakers have said in the past few weeks. Just a few days ago, GabeFollower revealed that the game's story hook may not be <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/">widely appreciated</a>, and the series ending right after being properly brought back would definitely be something that fans would not enjoy, although, as already mentioned, getting an ending, no matter how controversial, would undoubtedly be better than having the series end with the cliffhanger seen in Half-Life 2: Episode Two.</p>
<p>Though Half-Life 3 has yet to be officially announced, the day the highly anticipated game will be revealed may not be too far off. According to rumors, the game is being widely playtested right now for a possible Summer reveal and Winter release, and is fully playable from beginning to end.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wb-and-netherrealm-end-support-for-mortal-kombat-1-no-new-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-coming/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wb-and-netherrealm-end-support-for-mortal-kombat-1-no-new-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the reveal of the Mortal Kombat 1 Definitive Edition earlier this month, MK1 fans feared the worst. That Warner Bros. and NetherRealm had officially moved on from the game, and MK1 would have no more new DLC characters or story chapters added.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, WB confirmed those fears, announcing in <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">a post on X</a> that while Mortal Kombat 1 will receive bug support and balance adjustments in the future, "<em>there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1</em>," the post began, "<em>and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NT7MUHRcKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MK1 launched with <a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-ca/roster">22 playable fighters</a> in the base game, and through DLC Kombat Packs and its Khaos Reigns expansion, added another 13 fighters to the full roster. Last September, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">getting ready to launch</a> its Khaos Reigns expansion, and series co-creator <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1838566106119749948">Ed Boon was reassuring fans</a> that NetherRealm was prepared to support Mortal Kombat 1 "<em>for a long time to come</em>."</p>
<p>Eight months later, NetherRealm is moving on to its next project, which many are speculating will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/">Injustice 3</a>. NetherRealm has been going back and forth from Mortal Kombat to Injustice for more than a decade now, with the jump from Mortal Kombat 11 to Mortal Kombat 1 being the only time where Injustice was seemingly skipped.</p>
<p>It's not impossible that NetherRealm has another MK game lined up, but it feels unlikely. Hopefully, it won't be too long before we officially know what NetherRealm has lined up.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-director-says-persona-5-has-the-best-combat-visuals-and-ui/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-director-says-persona-5-has-the-best-combat-visuals-and-ui/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Game Director Guillaume Broche was featured in a series of interviews to discuss the game's development. For example, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he started working on the project due to his boredom while working at Ubisoft. Then, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-nintendo-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a potential Nintendo Switch 2 port for the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2505223a#i-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Japanese website Denfaminicogamer</a>, Broche discussed the influences of previous classics in the JRPG genre. Out of all of them, he singled out P-Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-stealing-hearts-defying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona 5</a> as the best game when it comes to combat visuals and user interface.</p>
<p><em>I grew up playing games, especially JRPGs, since I was a child, so I can't really say which elements of which titles influenced me. After playing a variety of games, I had my own ideas of "this part is interesting" and "this is what I think is the most interesting turn-based RPG." That was my final vision. What I wanted to focus on was sublimating my own view of JRPGs that I had developed since childhood and adding my own originality to it. In terms of specific titles that have influenced me, the list is endless, but they include Final Fantasy series VI to X, Shadow Hearts, Suikoden, the Atelier series, Lost Odyssey, and the Persona series.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, I think that "Persona 5" is the best game in the world in terms of battle depiction and UI creation. I was greatly influenced by the dramatic camera changes every time the player operates, and the production unfolds like watching a movie. I further changed the camera work to suit my own work and added my own particular touches to it, which is what I did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I still haven't been able to fully incorporate the good parts of Persona 5, so I'm still working on improving the UI.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, while the gameplay is influenced by JRPGs, the way the story is constructed was influenced by the French novels I've read, so I think the story is French.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is likely to be a strong Game of the Year candidate, especially now that Grand Theft Auto VI's massive shadow has moved to 2026.

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 1.0 release, which launched in late 2020, but so has technology, as the Nintendo Switch 2 version puts to real shame the original release running on PlayStation 4 Pro.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1/videos">Cycu1</a> puts recently released footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running side-by-side with footage of the unpatched 1.0 release running on PlayStation 4 Pro, easily highlighting not only how much the game has been improved since launch on pretty much every front, from stability to visuals, but also how good the Switch 2 version looks, relative to the hardware.</p>

<p>Besides sharing the comparison video above, Cycu1 shared other comparison videos comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 with the PlayStation 5 version running with ray tracing, the Xbox Series S version, the latest version of the game available on PlayStation 4 Pro, and the PC version running on Steam Deck. You can check out these videos below.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day the system releases, on June 5th. The new version of the game will include both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, which will be included in the retail cartridge, requiring no additional download. This, among a few other things, highlights well how CDPR has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">a lot of effort</a> into a port that is setting out to be among the most impressive to be released in the console's launch window.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nintendo-direct-to-air-the-week-of-the-switch-2-or-shortly-after-%E2%80%93-rumor.1198809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nerw-nintendo-direct-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Nintendo Direct presentation should air in the next couple of weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tvph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brasil</a>, who previously revealed correct information related to Nintendo's games and presentations in the past, revealed during a recent livestream, as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-direct-speculation-st11-fami-friends-pilgrimage-read-the-guidelines-before-posting.13733/page-26#post-1810158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, that the next Direct will air the same week the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, so the week of June 5th, or shortly after. No information on what could be shown during the presentation has been provided, though it will likely provide release dates for all games confirmed to launch this year, but whose precise release dates have yet to be determined, like the highly anticipated Metroid Prime 4: Echoes, which is launching on both Nintendo Switch systems, the Final Fantasy VII Remake port and others. Given that it is supposedly airing in the "Non-E3" week, some surprises could also be revealed.</p>
<p>The previous Nintendo Direct, which aired last month, focused entirely on the Nintendo Switch 2, providing a proper look at the system following its reveal back in January. Besides detailing some of the new system features, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat,</a> the presentation also revealed the Game Key Cards, which only include a download code for the game, but that can be used on multiple systems without tying the included game to a single Nintendo account, how to access the Nintendo Switch 2 editions of the original Switch games and more.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 is not too far from release and the Summer announcement season is ready to kick off, we will likely learn soon if a Nintendo Direct is airing in the next few weeks. We will let you know more as soon as more information comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-team-is-making-tech-changes-to-make-cross-play-possible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADaBPspkAL8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth and final episode of The Elder Scrolls Online podcast</a>, a special series produced with Kinda Funny Gamecast, ZeniMax Online's Head of Studio Matt Firor and Game Director Rich Lambert revealed that the studio is making changes to the game's underlying technology to potentially introduce cross-play in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Anything is possible. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> We're working on doing some underlying tech changes that would make it possible. We know how important it is. Again, we started working on this game in 2007. We didn't even think about two platforms, much less six or whatever we support now.</em></p>
<p><em>That whole concept, the "this is an Xbox" thing, because that philosophy now comes from the top, makes it easier to get the agreements done, to do what you need to do to do cross-play, which is an extremely long GDC presentation of technology, you know, handshaking other technologies. You don't just flip the switch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> And it's not just a technology problem, either. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> So, it's something we know about. It's something we really want to do. We're working on the underlying tech for it and we'll see if we can make it happen.</em></p>
<p>I had asked Rich Lambert about The Elder Scrolls Online cross-play in our previous interviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently at Gamescom 2024</a>, when he said:</p>
<p><em>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</em></p>
<p>It looks like the ZeniMax team has decided to give it a solid try, even though they haven't committed to cross-play coming to the game yet.</p>
<p>The popular MMORPG is transitioning from its previous yearly expansion model to a seasonal model beginning this June <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>. The update will also add a major new feature, multiclassing.</p>
