			<p>NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for its GeForce graphics cards. This new version (572.42) is optimized for Obsidian's Avowed, which launches on February 18 but is available starting today through advanced access for pre-orders of the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>By default, the game supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex, as well as ray-traced reflections. With this Game Ready driver, users will be able to unlock NVIDIA app overrides to enable DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, activate the Super Resolution transformer model, the latest improved Frame Generation model, and force DLAA (which isn't available from the in-game settings). We'll take a more in-depth look at visuals and performance in Avowed shortly; meanwhile, check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game review posted earlier today</a>.</p>
<p>GeForce Game Ready driver 572.42 is also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update</a>, which will be released next week. The game update will introduce fully ray-traced shadows and DLSS Ray Reconstruction denoising, which, according to NVIDIA, will improve visuals, as showcased in the following picture comparison.</p>

<p>The game will also be updated to take advantage of the NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA transformer model for improved image quality, as well as the enhanced Frame Generation model for better frame rates. Lastly, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will provide maximum performance on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards. NVIDIA says that combined, all these technologies can accelerate performance by up to 4X in the excellent adventure game released two months ago by MachineGames. The new flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 268.6 frames per second at 4K with Super Resolution set to Performance mode and Multi Frame Generation to 4x.</p>

<p>The driver also supports the new Wuthering Waves update that introduces ray tracing, DLSS Frame Generation, and Reflex. You can check out the ray tracing showcase below.</p>
<p>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery was also released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access yesterday</a> with support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>

			<p>The second Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC patch is now live, introducing various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.212.1.0 focuses mostly on stability improvements based on the developer's research and player reports. Among these are stability improvements on AMD GPUs introduced by disabling Anti-Lag 2, as the initialization of the tech's SDK caused driver crashes and, thus, instability.</p>
<p>Stability improvements are only some of the enhancements the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch brings. According to the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/576000532521418781?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, game version 1.212.1.0 also featured improved adjustability of Mouse Sensitivity, improved screen-space reflections, and new NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction options that allow users to enable it at native resolution and with the Ultra Performance setting. Rounding up the new additions included in today's patch are a variety of bug fixes and the ability to use Nintendo Switch Pro controllers with Steam Input.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was released two weeks ago on PC, and its launch was far from the best for PlayStation to PC ports due to stability issues and other visual issues, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">launch report</a>, which have yet to be completely fixed.</p>
<p><em>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version for the time being.</em></p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>
