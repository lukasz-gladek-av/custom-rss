			<p>Halo Studios, the new name for the studio formerly known as 343 Industries, will reveal what's next for the Halo series in October 2025 at the Halo World Championship 2025 event.</p>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">Halo Waypoint website</a>, the team addressed that there have been rumors floating around about what's next for the series. The post doesn't single out any specific rumor, like the rumors about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Master Chief Collection</a> coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2, or that the next Halo game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">release on PlayStation </a>alongside its Xbox and PC releases. </p>



<p>But it does confirm that it will be "<em>continuing the conversation</em>" it began at last year's HaloWC, where it announced Project Foundry, the team's switch to using Unreal Engine 5, and the studio name change from 343 Industries to Halo Studios. </p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>"<em>Over the past few weeks, there's been a fair bit of speculation about when and where more details might emerge about any of the multiple projects Halo Studios is actively working on,</em>" the studio began. "<em>We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event</em>."</p><p>"<em>Last year at HaloWC,</em> <em>we premiered 'A New Dawn' where we talked about the switch to Unreal Engine, gave you a behind the scenes look at Project Foundry, and debuted our evolution to Halo Studios as we enter a new chapter for Halo. For us, 'A New Dawn' was just the beginning - at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship. We really hope you'll join us in Seattle this October!</em>"</p></div>



<div><p>The last major entry into the long-running shooter series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/">Halo Infinite</a>, which was a mostly well-made game for all intents and purposes, but failed to take over the world in the same way new Halo games have done in the past. </p><p>Whatever Halo Studios has planned for the series, it is arguably the most important release for the Halo franchise yet. If it's not a success, it's worth asking whether Microsoft continues the series at all. That might feel like an insane thought, that Microsoft and Xbox would stop making Halo games. But a few short years ago, so did the idea that Microsoft would publish its first-party developed games on PlayStation and Nintendo devices. </p></div>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/">The Alters</a> developer, 11 bit Studios, has addressed allegations that generative AI technology was used in the game's development, admitting that it did use GenAI tech when making the game, though in some cases it was never meant to be in the final version. While other instances were intentional choices the team made due to "<em>time constraints</em>."</p>



<p>The Alters released earlier this month to strong critical acclaim, with the game currently sitting at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-alters/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">84 on Metacritic</a>, with both critics and players praising its narrative woven between different versions of one person. However, over the weekend it faced its first dash of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">controversy</a> after players discovered what they believed to be confirmation that 11 bit Studios used generative AI technology when making The Alters. </p>



<p>A major sticking point for players regarding the use of GenAI is how 11 bit studios used it for localization purposes, with players citing poor translations for Portuguese, Russian, and German, though the most significant aspect of 11 bit Studios using GenAI that has upset players is the fact that 11 bit Studios did not disclose they had used the technology. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">Valve's updated rules</a> for games published on Steam, the use of GenAI to produce the final product that's sold on the digital storefront must be disclosed to players. At the time of this writing, the disclosure is not on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/">The Alters Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>Now, we have 11 bit Studios side of the story, with <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118">a long statement published to the game's official X account</a>, where the team explains how one of the instances players have brought up was never meant to make it into the final version of the game. It also provides a screenshot of where the GenAI text can be found, showing how little of the game screen real estate it takes up, and claims it to be an isolated mistake, though says it isn't trying to "<em>downplay</em>" the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game</em>," the studio writes at the top of its statement. </p>



<p>"<em>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other choices, like using GenAI for localization work, it admits, were intentional choices made due to time constraints that it now says were "<em>the wrong call."</em> 11 bit Studios also claims that it always intended to go back and release a hotfix for the proper translations.</p>



<p>"<em>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented</em>."</p>



<p>11 bit Studios goes on to describe just how little of the game's text is GenAI, and how it wanted to have translations for the aforementioned films to ensure that it didn't only feature the English dialogue while localization work for other languages continued. "<em>In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know</em>."</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai">plenty of games</a> that use generative AI technology in development, whether as part of the process without intending GenAI assets to be in the final game, or as part of the final product. Like it or not, generative AI technology is part of the modern game development landscape, and it isn't going away anytime soon. It's clear that 11 bit Studios' biggest fumble here wasn't just using GenAI for a poor band-aid solution to its problems, but trying to sneak its GenAI use past players, hoping to patch the game before anyone noticed.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how Steam reacts to this, and if the storefront's rules around the disclosure of GenAI, and the failure disclose, will result in punitive action against developers who take the risk of trying to sneak GenAI assets past Steam.</p>
