			<p>A few weeks after <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM prices</strong> started spiking due to increased demand from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI data centers</strong> which will take some time to normalize, the critical situation for consumers (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">who apparently have gotten the narrative wrong</a></strong>) has now become evident, as prices for some devices have already been increased, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/"><strong>more are set to follow.</strong></a></p>



<p>Obviously, video game consoles will also be impacted by the current RAM prices and shortages, and another price increase will make the current console generation even more unusual, as it is the first one to date where console prices increased instead of dropping in the years following their launch. For the time being, however, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> may not be impacted by the current unprecedented situation.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a></em> in a new interview</strong> summarized by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Patents Watch</a></em></strong>, president <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shuntaro Furukawa</strong> commented on the impact the current high RAM prices could have on the new generation Nintendo system, saying that components are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"procured from suppliers based on Nintendo's medium to long term business plan,"</em> and, as such, the current memory price has no immediate impact on their financial performance and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> price should remain stable for the near future.</p>



<p>However, given the magnitude of the situation, no one can rest easy. <em>"We must monitor the situation closely,"</em> said <strong>Furukawa-san</strong> before refusing to <em>"comment on hypotheticals"</em> regarding a possible price increase for the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Although high RAM prices make any new hardware launch challenging, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo</strong> could be planning a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong> model. During the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kyoto Shimbun</em></strong> interview, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Furukawa-san</strong> mentioned that the company wants to make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> accessible to people <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age."</em> A cheaper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2 Lite</strong> model would definitely appeal to a younger crowd but it remains to be seen how affordable such a system would be in the current landscape.</p>



<p>With no slowdown in sight for the AI boom, purchasing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in the near future seems to be the safest choice for those still looking to get the system. In the future, Nintendo may eventually face a difficult choice: take a hit to its margins to protect the current price point, or <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">follow </strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a></strong> in increasing the system's price after its launch.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, modder <strong>Halk Hogan</strong> shared the second video preview of his <strong>The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition 2026</strong> mod. This new version of the popular visual remastering mod, which enhances thousands of the original game's assets, including textures, models, materials, and more, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-2026-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced two months ago</a>. </p>



<p>As usual, Halk Hogan also shared a brief message with the community, revealing what he'll be focusing on for this new version:</p>



<p><em>I'm back to share some fresh progress on the HDRP NextGen Edition. As you can see in the video, many objects will no longer be static and will now have wind simulation. All characters will also be reworked, along with all armor and equipment for Geralt and Roach; everything will now be much more detailed. Of course, this is just a small part of all the changes that will be included in The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition 2026, which will be available later this year.</em></p>

<p>It might just be a very timely release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-the-witcher-3-dlc-rumors-intensify-more-polish-websites-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to growing rumors</a>, <strong>CD Projekt RED is secretly preparing a new DLC</strong> for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, ten years after the release of <strong>Blood and Wine</strong>. Speculation is that it will somehow bridge the previous game with the upcoming The Witcher 4. IGN Poland previously heard that the studio was interested in introducing the Eastern realm of Zerrikania, though they acknowledged that the Northern kingdom of Kovir and Poviss might also be an option for the DLC.</p>



<p>If you just can't wait for either thing to release and want to play the game now, you can find the current The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Warning: the download is around 12GB.  </p>
