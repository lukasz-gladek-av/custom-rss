			<p>While there was some skepticism surrounding the Xbox Game Pass when it launched in 2017, players embraced the subscription model, which has been making solid revenue in the past few years.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222 on X, Richie Choudhary, former Head of Product at Xbox, revealed on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richie-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> that from 2019 until 2021, Xbox Game Pass stood at $2 billion a year in revenue, which is definitely an impressive figure, despite not being telling in regard to the sustainability of the subscription service, as there's no data on the profits.</p>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass delivers quite a bit of value to players, it definitely causes a considerable drop in sales. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">Earlier this year</a>, it was revealed that any game that is available as part of the subscription service's library can be expected to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, a little less if it is a big mainstream release. Still, certain games benefit from being part of the Game Pass library, such as multiplayer games, as a surge of players on Xbox systems can have a positive impact on sales on PlayStation consoles. The service also makes it easier for some developers to get players to try out their games.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass has become a fundamental part of Microsoft's strategy in the gaming space, which aims to get as many players as possible into the Xbox ecosystem, no matter the device. You can learn more about the subscription service on its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is still scheduled to be revealed and released this month, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, extremely reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">rumored</a> to launch yesterday, confirming that, as things stand, the game will still be released this month. Plans can obviously change, but with the insider's track record, it is safe to say that chances are high that we will soon be able to return to Cyrodiil soon, and experience it like we never did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As things stand, yes.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1907919010387370215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, we have known it has been in development in some capacity for <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">almost two years</a>, when the game's existence was revealed in an FTC investigational hearing held with Xbox's head Phil Spencer. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">rumors,</a> the remake is being developed by Virtuos in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> and will feature many new features and improvements over the original, including combat mechanics changes, some of them inspired by modern action games, HUD improvements, and more. If all of these changes will indeed be implemented in the final game, they should make for a far more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Those who haven't experienced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ahead of the remake still have the chance to do so on PC, as the GOTY edition, including all additional content, is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Console players, unfortunately, have no other option at the moment other than playing the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen features&nbsp;<span>many advancements compared to the Switch 1. It's larger (7.9 inches versus 6.2) and has a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p). It also supports High Dynamic Range and Variable Refresh Rate (the latter through NVIDIA G-SYNC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as confirmed yesterday by NVIDIA</a>), with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is not an OLED screen, which means <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-oled-model-feels-like-more-than-a-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> users (who were also blessed with a larger 7-inch screen) may feel like it's a bit of a downgrade when it comes to the lack of infinite contrast and truly inky blacks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-decided-to-go-from-the-switch-oled-to-an-lcd-screen-for-switch-2-after-a-lot-of-consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>,&nbsp;Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager of the Technology Development Division and Senior Director of the Technology Development Department at Nintendo, explained:</p>
<p><em>Now there's a lot of advancements that have been made in LCD technology during development. We took a look at the technology that was available to us now and after a lot of consideration we decided to stick to LCD.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty, many fans are simply convinced that Nintendo is waiting to release a more expensive OLED model a couple of years down the line. On the upside, at least there's a cheaper LCD model available with this approach.</p>
<p>On another note, as spotted <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/preeliminary-switch-2-game-file-sizes-revealed-mk-world-23-4-gb-donkey-kong-bananza-10-gb.1155054/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ResetEra</a>, the Japanese My Nintendo Store already includes preliminary information on how much space will be needed to install Nintendo Switch 2 games on the new console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Kart World - 23.4 GB</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Bananza - 10.0 GB</li>
<li>GameCube Nintendo Classics - 3.5 GB</li>
<li>Super Mario Jamboree Switch 2 Edition - 7.7 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>There's definitely an increase when it comes to the required install space compared to the Switch. However, we are nowhere near the size of most PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games, which approach or even surpass 100GB nowadays. On the flip side, those platforms have much larger drives available, whereas the Switch 2 only has 256GB (albeit expandable with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microSD Express format</a>).</p>
