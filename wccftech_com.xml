			<p><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation</strong> was undoubtedly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest gaming-related announcement</a> made by the world's largest company (by market cap) at <strong>CES 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of trailing behind NVIDIA in the upscaling department, AMD finally delivered a worthy competitor with <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4</strong> in 2025, with the year ending on a high note <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the <strong>Redstone</strong> update</a> that injected FSR with a machine learning algorithm, as well as delivering an improved <strong>Frame Generation</strong> algorithm and the brand new <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong> (an analog to NVIDIA's <strong>DLSS Ray Reconstruction</strong>) and <strong>Radiance Caching</strong> (seemingly similar to NVIDIA's <strong>Neural Radiance Cache</strong>, although it is not yet ready for release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fsr-radiance-caching-requires-further-development-optimization-is-not-currently-planned-release-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>).</p>



<p>Less than a month later, NVIDIA answered in kind with the release of its <strong>second-generation transformer model</strong> for the DLSS Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 has been trained on a much larger and higher-fidelity dataset, and as such, utilizes five times the compute power; that's why the initial tests have shown older <strong>GeForce RTX</strong> graphics cards struggling with it.</p>



<p>Luckily, those PC users can still use the older models, either the CNN one or the first-gen transformer model, which run games noticeably faster. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 is not really about increased speed - that's what Dynamic Multi Frame Generation helps with, but more on that later - <strong>it is instead about delivering the highest possible quality</strong>. This model demonstrates its power through a deeper understanding of game scenes and a more intelligent use of game engine pixel sampling and motion data, delivering output images with improved lighting, sharper visuals (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as demonstrated in an early <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> comparison</a>), and enhanced motion clarity.</p>



<p>We had our very own CEO, Abdullah Saad, attending CES 2026 and checking out the various NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 demos available at the booth. He was particularly impressed by the lighting improvement delivered by the new transformer model in the game <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and the NVIDIA rep explained:</p>



<p><em>There's a very technical reason for that. The engine does the math in what's called physical space, which is like how the physics actually operates. It's not thinking in terms of gamma and stuff like that. It's thinking basically in real life math, like the light goes here, this light is at this amount of nits, and then at some point down the pipeline, it gets tone-mapped and ported to your display. The older DLSS, preset K, is accumulating the data at the end of that, so after tone mapping. It's losing some of that data, the highlights for example, and it's accumulating on that. TAA (Temporal AntiAliasing) can also have that problem, but here we move the new one closer to the engine so it's seeing more of what the engine is trying to show as far as the lighting goes, so it's losing less of that highlight detail.</em></p>



<p>In more technical terms, the previous upscaling algorithm worked in logarithmic space to mitigate flickering, but resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. Now, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the same space used by games, and is thus capable of allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. This could be an indirect been to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR gaming</a></strong> under NVIDIA DLSS 4.5.</p>

<p>The other half of the NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 announcement, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, won't be available publicly before Spring 2026, but it could be tested at the NVIDIA CES 2026 booth. Beyond unlocking <strong>6X mode</strong> (five additional frames rendered apart from the real one), the update will also introduce <strong>an intelligent system capable of targeting your specific display's maximum refresh rate</strong>. </p>



<p>In the CES 2026 demo (featuring <strong>Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2</strong> game), the system was shown targeting the 240Hz of the 1440p display on hand. The NVIDIA rep stated:</p>



<p><em>If you went to a scene where it went up to 300 FPS, you'd see it lowering the multiplier because you'd be generating frames that are just being thrown out, right? This is a smarter way to use it. If you go up to one of the windows, the scene will get a lot lighter. You'll see your frame rate go up, and then it'll start lowering the multiplier because it'll know that you don't need that much frame generation. If you go over here, your frame rate will drop because this is a more intense scene and it's going to start raising the multiplier again.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also promises <strong>improvements in frame pacing and better accuracy in rendering in-game user interfaces</strong>, as shown in the official video above. The former will be particularly important, although we'll have to wait for its public release to test it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the popular <strong>DLSS Swapper</strong> tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-swapper-version-1-2-3-1-released-with-support-for-dlss-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just been updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</a>.</p>

			<p>On top of Windows Central's claim that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters/remakes would arrive "<em>eventually</em>,"</a> its executive editor, Jez Corden, also added more to the rumour mill on what Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones developer MachineGames has on the go. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">According to the report</a>, the studio is working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game, while also having Wolfenstein 3 "<em>on the cards</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, this time it's not just Windows Central claiming that Wolfenstein 3 is in development. Shortly after the initial Windows Central report, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku published its own</a>, corroborating what Windows Central claimed and, based on conversations it had with its own sources, went as far as to <strong>confirm that Wolfenstein 3 is in fact currently in development.</strong> </p>



<p>It's not shocking to hear that a new Wolfenstein game is coming from MachineGames. <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">Back in September 2025,</a> when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">NoClip</a> released a documentary on the making of the first two games, studio head <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> said, "<em>We have always <strong>seen this as a trilogy</strong></em>. <em>That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one</em>. <em>I think that's important to say, because⁠—at least I hope⁠—we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. <strong>We have a story to tell.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>If that's not a comment meant to prime players for a coming sequel, then there's no telling what is. Gustafsson would have made that comment, fully aware of when the documentary was to be released, with full knowledge of what the studio had coming. Today's reports add further fuel to the fire that we are indeed going to get a third, and seemingly closing chapter of BJ Blazkowicz's story.</p>



<p>The last Wolfenstein game was 2019's Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which focused on Blazkowicz's daughters instead of BJ himself. If a new game in the series arrives this year, it'll have been a seven-year gap since the last game in the series and a nine-year gap since the last game to feature BJ as the protagonist. </p>



<p>Along with a new game seemingly in the works, there's also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">a TV show adaptation of Wolfenstein coming from Amazon</a>, which could likely be revealed at the same time as the third game.</p>



<p>As for the multiplayer game Corden mentions, there's not much else to go on besides the quick description that it is meant to be a "<em>Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title</em>," though if Wolfenstein 3 is going to be ready in time for the coming TV show, then that may be the project the studio is closer to completing. While the idea of a new multiplayer game from MachineGames is exciting, fans of the studio would much rather the team focus on BJ Blazkowicz before anything else.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more official news to share from the studio itself soon.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has revealed a new line of DualSense controllers and PS5 side plates with its new Hyperpop Collection, which features three colourways and is arguably the boldest collection of new colours and designs that PlayStation has done with DualSense controllers and PS5 accessories since the console launched back in 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-new-faceplates-june-2022/">We've had some great solo-colour controllers and face plates</a>, but nothing so far that has tried to be a bit different outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">some limited runs of controllers featuring </a>designs <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-new-limited-edition-ps5-consoles-controllers/">based on individual games</a>. For anyone who remembers the kinds of designs and special editions we'd get back in the PS3 and PS4 days, these latest designs pale in comparison to how creative Sony and PlayStation used to get, but it's still encouraging to see them start branching out from just introducing new colours for controllers.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, we’re sharing the first look at the Hyperpop Collection, featuring three new striking designs for DualSense wireless controllers and PS5 console covers. With glossy blacks shifting into vivid neons, each finish introduces an all-new aesthetic into your gaming setup</em>," the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">reveal post on the PlayStation Blog</a> reads. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HYPERPOP Collection | PS5 &amp; PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2eYfvciS_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three colours are called <strong>Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue.</strong> "<em></em><em>We’re cranking the volume all the way up with a collection that doesn’t just stand out, it takes over the room</em>," added <strong>Leo Cardoso</strong>, one of the members of Sony's design team who worked on the new collection. "<em>Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>A seamless gradient wraps around the front and back of the DualSense, finished in a high-gloss coat that makes the colors POP more than ever</em>," added <strong>Sae Kobayashi</strong>, another member of the design team. "<em></em><em>The console covers are also getting the same glow-up, featuring a subtle hint of transparency.</em>"</p>



<p>Again, it's nice to see PlayStation do more than just solid colours, though the switch to a glossy finish is quite concerning, particularly for the controllers. You may be able to install the face plates with gloves and leave them untouched, but the controllers will start getting ruined the moment you pick them up. Unless you start wearing thin gloves whenever you play your PS5.</p>



<p>The DualSense controllers and face plates will be available beginning on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> with the controllers listed at<strong> $84.99 USD/¥12,480 (including tax)/€84.99/£74.99</strong>, and the face plates listed at <strong>$74.99 USD/¥11,480(including tax)/€74.99/£64.99</strong>. </p>
