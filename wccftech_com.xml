			<p>When IO Interactive announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">official title for Project 007 was 007 First Light</a> and that we'd hear more about it this week, the assumption was that we'd hear more about it during the Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off event.</p>
<p>That's not the case, it would seem, as <a href="https://x.com/IOInteractive/status/1929599155736900021">IO Interactive has just announced its very first IOI Showcase</a>, which will include "<em>exclusive reveals and information straight from the team</em>" on games in IO Interactive's portfolio, including Build A Rocket Boy's MindsEye, which IO Interactive is publishing.</p>
<p>007 First Light and Hitman: World of Assassination will also be featured in the showcase, which, as of now, seems to only feature information on 007 First Light, MindsEye, and Hitman.</p>
<p><iframe title="IOI Showcase: Official Livestream - June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh4qGAIrpCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With IO Interactive having its own showcase, it'll be interesting to see what from these games, if anything at all, appears during the Summer Game Fest kick-off livestream. It could be that we get a small trailer for one or two of these titles, and are told to tune into the IOI Showcase after the Summer Game Fest livestream for more.</p>
<p>Or, Keighley's showcase won't feature any of them, and those on the east coast of North America (even worse for those in the UK and Europe) will have to stay up late to hear more about 007 First Light.</p>
<p>And though everyone (myself included) is looking forward to 007 First Light, it'll also be interesting to see more from MindsEye. We recently got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">new trailer and a post-launch roadmap</a> following some less-than-enthusiastic previews, and neither the new trailer nor the roadmap seemed to give the game a positive shot-in-the-arm ahead of its launch next week. If anything, it all just brought up more questions about what this game will really look like when players have it in their hands. Hopefully we get to see a good chunk of gameplay and what that will be like on Friday.</p>
