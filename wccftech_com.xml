			<p>The system previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Kennan</a> has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIVmyOIV1MQ&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwZ1vjIDCjnzoBIiwnWst0qd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed today</a> as the ROG Xbox Ally, which will come in two variants that will both be able to play all sorts of PC games, including every game revealed during this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>
<p>As teased in the past few weeks, ASUS and Microsoft have partnered up to create two new premium handheld PCs that combine the power of Xbox with the freedom of Windows 11. The first model, the ROG Xbox Ally, is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life without sacrificing gameplay quality, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. The second model, the premium ROG Xbox Ally X, is powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will allow players to experience games at higher framerates and sharper visuals, and will come with 24GB of high-speed RAM and 1 TB of SSD storage. Judging from the amount of RAM alone, the premium model shouldn't have any trouble running the vast majority of games currently available well.</p>

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will launch this Holiday season worldwide. A set release date hasn't been confirmed, but its launch will be momentous even for those who aren't thinking about picking up either system, as the highly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong will be available when the system officially launches.</p>
