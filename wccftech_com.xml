			<p>We found out <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/">earlier this year</a> that Stellar Blade would be arriving on PC this June, but we didn't have a specific release date at the time.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to someone at PlayStation hitting the 'publish' button a tad early on the company's official YouTube account, we know that Stellar Blade will be available on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store on <strong>June 11, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The trailer was posted to the official PlayStation YouTube account and removed shortly after, but not before it could be downloaded and posted to the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">Reddit page</a>, where you can still check it out.</p>
<p>Besides the release date, the trailer shows off Stellar Blade running on PC, and confirms that it will support NVIDIA's DLSS 4 AI upscaling and AMD's FSR 3. It also confirms that the PC version will support ultra-wide displays and that you'll be able to play it with full DualSense haptics and adaptive trigger support.</p>
<p>We also get a quick look at a new boss battle players will be able to tackle, 25 new outfits added for the game's protagonist Eve, and some shots of the better textures and graphical features PC players will be able to enjoy, assuming, of course, they have the hardware to do so. Also, while the trailer doesn't explicitly confirm it, PS5 players should expect the new boss fight and outfits to come to the console version when the PC version releases in June.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the most anticipated action games of 2024, impressing players with its intense combat and stunning visuals. When it debuted on console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Wccftech's reviewer Kai Tatsumoto called Stellar Blade</a> "<em>a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em>"</p>
