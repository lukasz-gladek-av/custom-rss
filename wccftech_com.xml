			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost mode can bring significant improvements in terms of image quality and performance even in games that haven't been patched to take advantage of all the system's features, a new analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In a new video shared over the weekend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at how the current-generation Final Fantasy games run on the mid-generation system released last month. Being the only PS5 Pro Enhanced title, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is clearly the star of the show. In the new Versatility Mode only available on PlayStation 5 Pro, the second entry in the Remake series features improved image clarity and more stable performance over Performance Mode in pretty much every scenario. In combination with a small resolution boost over the base model, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler delivers some impressive results, although with some issues that are unique to the game, such as vegetation issues both at a distance and up close, and common among games using the current iteration of the upscaler, which should become a thing of the past in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">future versions</a>.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting with the other current-generation Final Fantasy games, as none of them have received PlayStation 5 Pro patches. Final Fantasy XVI, for example, shows significant improvements in both display modes. In Graphics mode, for example, Game Boost Mode allows the game to run at a higher internal resolution, which results in clearer and more detailed image. Performance Mode sports a far smaller internal resolution boost but considerably more stable performance with a 24% uplift, which often falls into the system's VRR range. In scenarios where the base model struggles to hit 60 FPS, the PS5 Pro manages to do so consistently. In addition, the game's combination of TSC MAA and FSR 1 leaves much of the image pixel structure intact, resulting in less aliasing on the mid-generation system.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV improvements are more significant on the PlayStation 5 Pro with Game Boost, with an up to 40% performance improvement in 4K mode with dynamic resolution off. On the new system, the game manages to hit 60 FPS consistently, and only the most intense scenarios cause drops. At 1440p resolution, the game also often manages to hit 120 FPS, resulting in great image fluidity. Even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins sports more stable performance on the PlayStation 5 Pro without a dedicated patch, which is a significant improvement for an intense action game like the spin-off developed by Team NINJA.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro offers a variety of new features over the base model, which make it a compelling upgrade for those looking to experience console games at their best despite its high price.

			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch is now live on PC, addressing some crashing issues and a few other issues.</p>
<p>The 1.1.3 patch, which has been confirmed to be the last patch of the year for the game, is considerably smaller than the previous patch in both size and scope. Weighting around 7.4 GB, the patch focuses on fixing a small selection of issues, introducing a temporary solution to avoid crashes on shader compilation by skipping shaders warm up, as well as addressing a few access violation error crashes, an issue when invert axis options could not be saved after restarting the game and another issue where controls could be lost after shooting, reloading and then examing the artifact. The detailed patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525330030617690996?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new STALKER 2 patch is much smaller in scope than the previous one, which addressed over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/">1800 issues</a>, improved the A-Life system, and improved optimization, among other things. Performance was also improved on RTX 3000 series cards with AMD frame generation, although the minor improvements show how there's still plenty of work to be done in this regard.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC World by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A Dead Space 4 game is something fans have been yearning for ever since the third mainline installment was released over ten years ago. Of course, the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017 while they were making the Star Wars project codenamed Ragtag threw a big wrench into those plans, but the remake of the first game released by Motive Studios in early 2023 certainly rekindled hopes - at least until the sales, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid critical reception</a>, turned out to be too low, and publisher EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to put the IP back on the shelf.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming</a>, three of the original franchise creators (Bret Robbins, Glen Schofield, and Christopher Stone) revealed that they actually pitched Dead Space 4 to Electronic Arts in 2024. Needless to say, they weren't successful.</p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> We tried, actually, you know, the three of us, for Dead Space 4. I mean, we're talking this year. We didn't go too deep; they just said we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah. We know who to talk to, so we didn't go and take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so yeah.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Christopher Stone:</strong> The industry is in a weird place right now, and people are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you got to, you know, take it with a grain of salt. Who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do Dead Space 4.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> Yeah. We got some ideas.</em></p>
<p>It is likely that they pitched it too soon to Electronic Arts following the unsuccessful release of the remake. The trio tried anyway because they were all free at the time, following their own games that didn't go as well as planned. Bret Robbins was the founder of Ascendant Studios and Game Director on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, which flopped hard, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive layoffs at the studio</a>. Glen Schofield and Christopher Stone were Game Director and Chief Creative Officer at Striking Distance Studios on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Callisto Protocol</a>, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly unsuccessful compared to its budget</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all three have new jobs. This September, Bret Robbins joined Absurd Ventures, the new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> in 2021 by Rockstar's Dan Houser, as Game Director on an unannounced project. Christopher Stone became Studio General Manager of VOID Interactive, the developer behind the tactical FPS game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready or Not</a>, in August. And Schofield? Here's what he said in the video interview:</p>
<p><em>I have been working on a smaller project. We're trying to get funding right now. It's a pretty exciting project. It's smaller, and I'm not directing; I'm going to be executive producing it.&nbsp;When you hear what it's about, if we get the funding, you'll understand. It's something kind of special for me.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like it will be some time before the trio are ready to pitch Dead Space 4 again. Fans might want to prepare for a long wait, but at least they still intend to make it at some point - EA willing, of course.</p>
