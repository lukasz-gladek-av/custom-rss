			<p>It will be a very long time before Borderlands 4 gets a deep discount and hits subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, Randy Pitchford recently said.</p>
<p>Commenting on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">Steam Summer Sale 2025</a> deep discount of the third entry in the series, which is now available for 95% off its full price, the Gearbox CEO highlighted how it took five years for the game to get such a deep discount and become available on gaming subscription services, suggesting players to take advantage of the deal. To set expectations for the future, Randy Pitchford added that it will take much longer for the same to happen for Borderlands 4. Though the Gearbox CEO later clarified his statement, suggesting that it may not be up to him for this to happen, reiterating that he is not <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938408120415621234">involved in pricing and sales,</a> it will be very interesting to see how much this statement will hold in the future.</p>
<p>The longer time it will take for Borderlands 4 to get a deep discount over its predecessor isn't the only thing that will set the two games apart. According to Executive Producer Chris Brock, the new entry in the series will be more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/">an evolution</a> for the franchise than its predecessor was, which was designed to be as familiar as possible due to the franchise not having received a new entry in seven years. Traversal abilities and exploration, in particular, will set the new game apart from the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released later.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-unveils-hexe-marie-boss-fight-in-crimson-desert/">Pearl Abyss</a> is bringing <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert</a> back to Gamescom with another demo available for those in attendance at Gamescom 2025 to try out for themselves ahead of the game's launch sometime this fall.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was playable at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and before the event, there were rumblings that we'd see the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">launch sometime in early 2025</a>. That didn't happen, of course, with Pearl Abyss announcing a fall 2025 release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
<p>We nearly had a release date revealed last week, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">Korean website reporting that Crimson Desert would arrive on November 2, 2025</a>. Pearl Abyss released a statement following the report, simply saying, "<em>When the company is ready to announce a release date, it will come from official channels</em>."</p>
<p>That statement doesn't exactly deny the November 2 date, though, of course, it doesn't confirm it either. We'll have to wait for Pearl Abyss to properly announce the date, which could potentially come at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>If you do check out Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be playing it on an AMD-powered PC with Samsung G6 and G8 monitors on display. You'll also walk away with a bag of Crimson Desert merchandise, according to a press release from Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to debut Crimson Desert's latest public demo for the very first time here at Gamescom 2025</em>," said chief executive officer of Pearl Abyss Europe, Lybee Park.</p>
<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to get hands-on with the experience we've crafted. From the immersive booth to the gameplay itself, we hope every visitor walks away feeling part of Crimson Desert - and excited for what's to come at launch</em>."</p>
<p>If you want to run right to the Pearl Abyss booth once you break through the Gamescom doors, you'll be able to find them in the Entertainment Area in Hall 06.1, Stand B041-A040.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dayz-badlands-expansion-announced-adds-new-desert-environment-infected-variants-and-more-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dayz-badlands-expansion-announced-adds-new-desert-environment-infected-variants-and-more-in-2026.1230066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/vigor-pc-release-early-access/">Bohemia Interactive</a> has announced the next expansion for DayZ, titled Badlands, which adds a new desert environment in the Nasdara province, new variants of infected that have adapted to the harsh rule of the desert, and more when it arrives sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Badlands adds "<em>the largest official map in the game's history,</em>" according to Bohemia Interactive in a press release, with 267 square kilometers of desert for players to explore in Nasdara's desert. It's also not just dry sand as far as the eye can see. There are towns, ruins, oil fields, and plenty of environmental storytelling to discover in the post-war desert.</p>
<p><iframe title="DayZ Badlands - Expansion Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oad7AX7gWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The desert also brings a few desert-specific survival elements, meaning players will need to keep an eye on how hydrated they are and stay out of the sun to keep cool and alive. And as previously mentioned, there's more to watch out for beyond the regular-world desert hazards, with new variants of infected that have all been warped by the desert.</p>
<p>Bohemia Interactive also adds that this expansion will feature "<em>player-driven storytelling</em>," as players form factions and discover "<em>forgotten secrets.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Bohemia Interactive vows to push the boundaries of what survival means in the DayZ universe with DayZ Badlands</em>," the studio writes in a press release. "<em>From the scorched cities to the silent sands, Nasdara is a land shaped by war, reset by the outbreak, now waiting for new stories to be written in its sands</em>."</p>
<p>This is a big switch from the last major expansion for DayZ, which was<a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-frostline-expansion-announced-livonia-dlc-free/"> Frostline</a>, taking players to the dead of winter, instead of the desert. Hopefully, we'll know more about this expansion soon, like a proper release date instead of its current release window for next year, and get a better look at what to expect when we head into the desert.</p>
