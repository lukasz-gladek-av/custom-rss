			<p>Capcom hosted its Spotlight Showcase 2025 event this evening and showcased new gameplay for several of its key upcoming games, including <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/news.html">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, due out next year on February 27, 2026.</p>
<p>Requiem was first revealed at the beginning of this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest 2025's</a> big showcase, with a cutscene that gave us a short look into the game's story, but not a look at gameplay.</p>
<p>While we didn't get a full gameplay deep-dive during the spotlight event, we did get a solid look at gameplay, which was featured between clips of members of the development team talking about different aspects of the game, such as their foundational concept of wanted to create a feeling of "<em>addictive horror</em>" and how challenging the team felt it was to bring players back to Raccoon City, because of how significant the city is in the series history.</p>

<p>Capcom also dug a bit more into Grace Ashcroft, who they described as being more introverted and frightened than series regular Leon Kennedy would be in the same situations, wanting to create a character that would be closer to how the player feels while playing the game, unsure of what will happen around the next corner.</p>
<p>That said, Capcom clarified that she's still an FBI agent and is more than capable with a weapon. First-person gameplay was described as being more for players who want a horror-focused experience, while action-focused players ought to pick third-person.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant comments made by the team came from director Koshi Nakanishi, who explained a bit about why it's important for Capcom to be going back to Raccoon City in this game, and the significance of the game's title.</p>
<p>"<em>This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before. Resident Evil is a series that was born from Umbrella and the Raccoon City zombie outbreak. And we chose the title "Requiem" to mark a milestone in the series."</em></p>
