			<p>The recently released PC version of Red Dead Redemption doesn't feature any significant improvement over the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports, but thankfully, modders are already coming to the rescue, turning the new version of the glorious open-world game by Rockstar Games into the definitive edition of the game.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video put together by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Digital Dreams</a> shows how much mods like<a href="https://wccftech.com/reality-redemption-overhaul-mod-is-now-available-for-rdr-pc/"> Reality Redemption</a> and ReShade ray tracing can improve the game's visuals and make it feel closer to the proper modern remaster the game deserved but that Rockstar Games did not provide.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K100] Red Dead Redemption remastered with Mods and RAYTRACING | BeyondallLimits gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhufsG0gXd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially being the same game as the one released almost 15 years ago on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Red Dead Redemption, at the very least, runs extremely well on PC. An <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">RTX 4070 GPU</a>, which is far from being a high-range GPU, for example, has no trouble running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, so any other mod coming in the future making big visual changes to the game shouldn't compromise performance even on lower-end machines.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director‚Äôs Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven‚Äôt seen Kojima‚Äôs vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what‚Äôs actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what‚Äôs come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director‚Äôs Cut, there‚Äôs little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 5 Pro patch uses some of the console's features to deliver the best version of the game until the launch of the PC version.</p>
<p>From today, owners of the upgraded PS5 model will be able to enjoy the second entry in the remake project with a variety of improvements introduced by the 1.050 patch. The patch introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Versatility Mode</a>, which targets 60 FPS like Performance Mode but offers a high resolution equivalent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Im0BR2QmIk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphics Mode</a> thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. Additionally, the update uses the PlayStation 5 Pro High CPU Frequency Mode to offer a more stable framerate throughout the game.</p>
<p>Besides providing the details of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch, Square Enix also shared a few screenshots showcasing how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks on the system in Versatility Mode. You can check them out right below.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide today. With improved specs and the aforementioned PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the system introduces improvements to over 50 titles that have already received their PS5 Pro patch. Even games that haven't received a dedicated patch can see improvements, as showcased by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/">early tests</a> conducted earlier this week.</p>
