			<p>The NvRTX branch of the impressive Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo sports some advanced features that even the most powerful GPU on the market cannot handle at native 4K resolution properly.</p>
<p>As shown in a new test video shared by Compusemble, advanced features like Mega Geometry, ReSTiR Global Illumination and Path Tracing and more can tank performance at native 4K resolution even on an<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/"> RTX 5090 GPU,</a> the most powerful GPU currently available on the market. In some scenarios, the demo runs at a whopping 13 FPS, proving how gaming hardware still isn't ready for some of the advanced RTX features NVIDIA has been working on. Things get slightly better with NVIDIA DLSS, and it's only in Performance mode that the RTX 5090 can run the demo at above 30 FPS in the same scenario that tanked performance at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah Demo: NvRTX Branch vs Stock UE5 - NvRTX Can Run As Low As 13FPS on 5090 Depending on the Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdbjsO8k8mM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah demo cannot be run at acceptable performance at native 4K resolution, there's no denying that some of the technology is impressive. Among the new features that have yet to be implemented in games is RTX Neural Rendering, which can quickly create a neural representation of thousands of textures to save VRAM and RAM much more than the currently used compression tech. More information on Neural Rendering can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">official website.</a></p>

			<p>A couple of Oblivion Remastered mods shared online a few hours ago introduce stability and performance improvements to the game, allowing those with more dated systems to run the game with fewer technical issues.</p>
<p>The No More VRAM Leaks Crashes mod, which was released today by SmokerNaruto on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/399?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a modified Unreal Engine 5 configuration file that caps texture streaming to the user's GPU VRAM and disables ray tracing and Lumen to prevent crashes on GPUs with lower VRAM capacity, like 4 and 6 GB. However, improvements for 8 GB VRAM GPUs are also expected, so this mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game properly.</p>
<p>Much like stability, performance in Oblivion Remastered is not particularly solid on anything&nbsp;<span>other than a top-end machine. As such, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/280?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGEND FPS patch</a> by NBCoo is another mod that is more than worth a try. It</span> introduces some tweaks that can improve performance without significantly impacting the visuals, such as turning off motion blur, bloom, film grain, and even improving water. Some users, however, have experienced slightly worse performance with this mod, so the experience may vary depending on the system configuration.</p>
<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Oblivion Remastered was finally confirmed to be real this week with a highly anticipated reveal, which came shortly before the game<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"> launched</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Developed by Virtuos, the game uses Unreal Engine 5's latest version to deliver improved visuals while keeping the Gamebryo engine for its underlying logic to offer gameplay mostly in line with the original, complete with some choice improvements such as revamped UI and more.</p>

			<p>Today, Polish developer 11 bit studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 1886</a>, a reimagining of the original Frostpunk game powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. The game is currently slated to launch at some point in 2027.</p>
<p>11 bit studios plan to provide a much improved visual experience, but they won't stop there. Fans can expect a lot of new content, mechanics, events, technologies, and buildings. There will even be an entirely new Purpose path in addition to the existing Faith and Order paths. Additionally, the switch from the original game's proprietary Liquid Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 will also bring mod support, a feature that franchise fans have requested for years, to Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the studio also expressed a desire to continue making content for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 2</a> and this reimagining of the original, keeping both updated for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The studio didn't share any further specifics, but there'll be time for that, given that we will have to wait for a couple of years. Meanwhile, you can refer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-chilling-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our original Frostpunk review</a> (scored 8.5/10 back then):</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is unforgiving and punishing but that’s why you’ll invest more and more time into it. It takes what you know about city builders and turns it on heads. It’s bleak, and the beautiful design brings life to an otherwise frozen hellscape. The race against the clock is stressful as you try to make sure everyone is alive while the weather gets colder and colder and materials become more and more scarce. Frostpunk is a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is a challenging city builder where your decisions have dramatic repercussions on the citizens you’re tasked with looking after in a wintery apocalypse. It's a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-english-voice-recording-may-have-already-started.1172370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-english-recording/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>English voice recording for Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 may have already begun, judging from a recent social media post.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/english-voice-recording-for-final-fantasy-vii-part-3-likely-underway.1172094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Cody Christian, who plays Cloud Strife in the Remake trilogy, recently shared an Instagram story with a caption that suggests the voice actor is recording lines for the character. Considering the story was confirmed to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">complete</a>d a few months back, it's not unlikely the script has also been finalized, thus allowing the voice recordings to begin.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, except that its development started before Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched last year on PlayStation 5. As already mentioned, it was confirmed a few months back that the plot for the game is complete, and the concept powering the final part of the trilogy is crucial. One of the features that will set the upcoming finale apart from its predecessor is the ability to explore the world with the Highwind airship, a feature the development team is fully committed to delivering without compromises. Hopefully, this means that even the regions that already appeared in Rebirth will receive some shakeup to make it interesting to revisit them.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Remake fans who own a PlayStation 5 had the chance to experience the second entry in the series last year, PC players were given the opportunity to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth only this year. The wait, however, was worth it, also thanks to modders who are introducing features not available in the vanilla game, such as additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters.</a></p>

			<p>Ever since we learned via rumors and leaks that Oblivion was returning, it was unclear whether it would be a remaster or remake. The initial wording found in Bethesda's internal documents <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial mentioned a remaster, but then we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found out</a> that Bethesda had enlisted another developer (Virtuos, the same one that's doing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater) to port the game to Unreal Engine 5 and make several improvements to areas such as combat, leveling, user interface,</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and launch</a> earlier this week, many were surprised at the amount of work that had been done. One of them was original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Design Director Bruce Nesmith, who became Lead Designer of Skyrim and also worked on Starfield before leaving Bethesda in September 2021 to pursue a career as a book author. <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/original-elder-scrolls-oblivion-designer-was-floored-by-new-release-im-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/?callback=in&amp;code=ZTGYZMU0ZTETM2I4NS0ZOGU3LTGXMJETMZIXY2IZOGFINWMX&amp;state=e74208805f8a402a906dbd7c2f353923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Videogamer</a>, he said this is closer to 'Oblivion 2.0' than a mere remaster:</p>
<p><em>I spent a lot of years working on that game. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it, along with everybody else on the team. And I intimately knew every single scene that they were showing. And they looked amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was assuming this was going to be a texture update. I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be… I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game. That’s a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice. The closest that could come to categorizing it is Oblivion 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the new game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily moddable</a>. While its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, the game logic is still powered by the original engine, so several original mods are being ported right now. This could pave the way to many further improvements from the already thriving modding community. There are already 270 mods on Nexus, and it's just the beginning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blade-runner-unannounced-game-canceled-by-supermassive.1172337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blade-runner-unannounced-game-canceled-by-supermassive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-blade-runner-game-canceled-supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Guildford-based game developer Supermassive Games recently canceled an unannounced game based on the Blade Runner IP.</p>
<p>The game was allegedly titled Blade Runner: Time To Live. It would have been a "character-driven, cinematic, action-adventure game" set in 2065. The plan was to make a "compelling story that blends the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay," with an expected length between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live started pre-production in September 2024 and was being worked on by the team that made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>. Pre-production was supposed to be completed in March 2025, while prototyping was scheduled to end around six months later.</p>
<p>The game's release was tentatively planned for September 2027 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Interestingly, the report also mentions a potential launch on next-generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms. However, it's hard to imagine that Supermassive would already know so much about Sony's and Microsoft's plans that they would be aware of whether the new consoles will be available then.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live was projected to have a budget of approximately $45 million, with $9 million set aside for external performance capture and acting talent. Original music production, image rights, usage fees for actors, QA and game testing, localization, and any future DLCs would have to be budgeted separately.</p>
<p>The game would feature a replicant known as So-Lange as the playable character. It would start in New Zurich, with So-Lange tasked to 'retire' a dangerous leader of an underground replicant network called Rev. However, So-Lange would soon be betrayed and left for dead in a hostile environment. In terms of game mechanics, the report says it would have been possible to upgrade skills and abilities.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the early cancellation weren't detailed, although it is said that Blade Runner IP owner Alcon was to blame. Of course, this is just one side of a story that may never fully come to light. It's a shame, though, as Supermassive definitely has the chops to make an interesting adventure game set in this universe.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there was any game set in this seemingly ripe setting. Thankfully, there's still Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, in development at Annapurna Interactive since 2022.</p>
