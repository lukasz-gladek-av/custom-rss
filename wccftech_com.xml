			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>'s engine was updated with features lifted from later versions of the engine to enable PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features like PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution support.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, Ninja Theory's Technical Director Gavin Costello goes over the work that went into porting the second entry in the series to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, saying that the process was more about porting the technology than the game specifically. Taking advantage of the very good platform integration Epic has in place, the team had no trouble getting the game running and fully playable from beginning to end on Sony's consoles and getting an overview of where the game's performance was. From this point, the developer implemented every feature of the game into the new versions of the game, and also updated the older version of Unreal Engine 5 the game shipped on with new features taken from newer version of the engine to enable some PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features, like PSSR and variable rate shading. Considering the launch of the PlayStation 5 version of the game will coincide with the release of a new update for the Xbox Series version which introduces a 60 FPS performance mode on Xbox Series X, it is likely these new features have allowed the implementation of 60 FPS gameplay into this version of the game.</p>

<p>Introducing a Performance Mode on Xbox Series X is only <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/">one of the new features</a> that will hit Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II with tomorrow's update. On PC, this new version of the game will introduce a Very High preset that pushes visual fidelity further, as well as Steam Deck verification featuring optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the system. The update will also introduce a new play mode and other improvements.</p>



<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The PlayStation 5 port, as well as the Enhanced update, will launch tomorrow, August 12.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Making a Far Cry TV Series with FX]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the recently confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed live-action TV series at Netflix</a>, Ubisoft has confirmed that it has another adaptation of one of its franchises in the works. This time, it's in collaboration with FX, and it's a TV series adaptation of the Far Cry franchise.</p>



<p>But this announcement isn't like the Assassin's Creed one, because it wasn't supposed to be live. Ubisoft let the news slip on its website before quickly redacting and redirecting the page, though not quickly enough that it wasn't shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a> and caught by the rest of the internet.</p>



<p>The details of the series which remain on Reddit reveal that the series is set to be an anthology, where "<em>each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding the talent behind the series, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star and co-creator Rob Mac <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rob-mcelhenney-legally-change-name-rob-mac-1236443403/">(formerly known as Rob McElhenney)</a> and Noah Hawley, the creator and writer behind FX's Fargo series and more recently its soon-to-debut at the time of this writing Alien: Earth series are leading the charge on FX's take on the world of Far Cry.</p>



<p>Mac is set to star in the Far Cry series, at least for the first season, presumably, while Hawley will take showrunning duties. Mac will also be an executive producer alongside Hawley, Jackie Cohn of More Better Productions, Michael Garcia of 26Keys Productions, and Nick Frenkel of 3Arts Entertainment. For Ubisoft's part, Gerad Guillemot, Margret Boykin, and Austin Dill are alongside as executive producers from Ubisoft's film and television division. </p>



<p>Boykin, head of Ubisoft's film and television division, is quoted as saying "<em>This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling</em>."</p>



<p>Since it'll be an anthology series, there's no expectation that it'll try to follow in the footsteps of previous Far Cry games. It's more likely that the show will focus on telling its own stories, so maybe don't expect Vaas to show up or anything like that. That said, there's always the chance Mac and Hawley could do their own thing with the show while leaving a few Easter-eggs for fans of the games to pick up on. Hopefully, we'll know more about it soon, whenever Ubisoft decides to put the news back on its website.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 Will Continue Being Supported Even After the Recent Cuts]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, Turn 10 was allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned into a Forza franchise support studio</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another round of cuts</a> at the Microsoft-owned developer. Following the dire news, fans have been wondering whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Motorsport</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> would continue being supported with new updates and fixes.</p>



<p>The official answer came a few days ago via the official Forza Motorsport account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community. We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.</em></p>



<p>Truth be told, there were few worries about the latter game. While nearly two years older, Forza Horizon 5 was much more critically and commercially successful. The open world racing game recently launched on Sony's PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to top charts there</a>, too, showing the game's strength even four years after its original debut on PC and Xbox Series. There's little doubt that there will be a Forza Horizon 6, and according to some rumors, it may not even be that far off. </p>



<p>However, a new Forza Motorsport may be a lot harder to imagine if Turn 10 has really been turned into a support studio. In the meantime, the 2023 game just saw the reactivation of the Track Toys Tour, which has now permanently returned to Forza Motorsport alongside its associated reward car: the 2019 Porsche #70 Porsche Motorsport 935.</p>



<p>Track Toys Tour is the second Featured Tour to be re-activated in Career mode, and all four of its series, in addition to its Reward Showcase, can be played at any time. At the start of each month, Turn 10 will bring an additional Tour to the game. Up next is the Ringer Tour on September 4. This cadence will continue until all of the Tours have returned.</p>
