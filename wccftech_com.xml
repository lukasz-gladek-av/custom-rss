			<p>Lords of the Fallen developer HEXWORKS continues improving the game at a rather impressive rate. After November's big <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 update</a> that introduced enhanced exploration of the Umbral realm, balance changes, and PlayStation 5 Pro support (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-max-pc-settings-in-lords-of-the-fallen-says-dev-a-comparable-pc-would-be-more-costly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further detailed in our exclusive interview</a>), the Spanish team has already released a new major update to improve the fluidity of combat thanks to more accurate animation cancellation, improved invincibility frames, more intuitive dodges and rolls, serious attack button prompts, general stamina balancing, and more.</p>
<p>These latest enhancements are meant to make players feel more in control when playing Lords of the Fallen, especially in combat. In the vision of the developer, they also help lower the entry barrier for new players while raising the skill ceiling for more experienced players. Version 1.7 also includes several quality-of-life updates, such as the ability to toggle automatic Vigor collection (first added in November's v1.6 update), more realistic enemy attack ranges and tracking for more immersive encounters, and further balancing the New Game Plus experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, newcomers will now get the ability to summon NPCs to assist in boss battles before the first encounter (previously, this could only be done after the first defeat). HEXWORKS has tweaked their stats to make them more viable allies in combat. Version 1.7 also sees the addition of a fan-favorite character, the Hallowed Sentinel Hound (also known as 'Good Boy'), as a new summonable NPC for boss encounters.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't get a high score on Wccftech</a> at launch, but it has since been massively revamped with several updates like this one. There's already a sequel on the way for 2026 that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises</a> gameplay improvement, better production values, and more upgrades. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> it will be an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, following a major investment by Epic Games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can get Lords of the Fallen for 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The offer is only valid for a limited time.</p>
