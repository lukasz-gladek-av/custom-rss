			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong continues to be one of the most anticipated indie games because, in the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c"> six years since its first reveal</a>, it's still not out.</p>
<p>But it will be out this year, according to developer Team Cherry. We've known that the studio has been targeting a 2025 release date, partly because there will be a playable version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">in an Australian museum this coming September</a>. However, following the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 event and the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, Team Cherry has made a new statement confirming that Silksong will indeed arrive this year.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally reveal had Hollow Knight fans confused, as the reveal for the new handheld almost exclusively showcased Hollow Knight Silksong gameplay, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g&amp;t=2370s">Xbox president Sarah Bond followed up by saying,</a> "<em>The highly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong will be available at launch, and in Game Pass, when the Ally releases later this year</em>."</p>
<p>Fans were quick to jump on that, and presumed that once we have a release date for the ROG Xbox Ally, we'll have our Silksong release date. That's not exactly the case, though, as Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon took to the studio's official Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-is-coming-this-year-following-xbox-games-showcase">Eurogamer</a>) to clarify that Silksong's release is not tied to the launch of any device, but the game will arrive this year, before the holiday season.</p>
<p>"<em>I confirmed before holiday,</em>" Griffon wrote. "<em>We are not tied to a console release</em>."</p>
<p>That means we'll have a release date at some point between now and the end of the year. Which is about as vague as the release date for Silksong has always been, but at least this time, it really feels like we're closing in on the game being ready for prime time. Hopefully, by Gamescom 2025, we'll have a specific release date publicly announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-announces-press-start-event-for-june-12-with-mgs-delta-silent-hill-f-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese game developer and publisher KONAMI announced an upcoming event titled 'Press Start' that will take place on June 12 at 6:00 AM Pacific Time / 9:00 AM Eastern Time / 3:00 PM Central European Time. The live stream will be watchable via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/KONAMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/konami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;KONAMI already said that it will last around 37 minutes. Subtitles will be available in 13 languages.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the studio confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be prominently featured in the broadcast. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Developed in Unreal Engine 5 with the help of Virtuos, the game features modern controls (with the option to stick to legacy controls) and an upgraded battle damage system that reflects the wear and tear to Snake's clothes and the bruises and bullet wounds on his body in real time. These injuries will leave permanent marks on Snake's body, telling the story of each player's unique journey through the game. The game's official PC system requirements are available <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 28.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is a new entry in KONAMI's prized horror franchise. It's being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, a Hong Kong team that previously worked on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Marvel's Avengers, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. During last week's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the game, set in a secluded town in 1960s Japan, will be released on September 25 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>But that's not all we're getting in the Press Start event, as KONAMI teased that 'more' will be shown. Of course, whether that's something significant or perhaps just an update for eFootball remains to be seen.</p>
