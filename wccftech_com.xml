			<p>Hideki Kamiya has found himself working with Capcom once again with the unexpected, but highly anticipated sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a>, but it's not the only game he wants to work with Capcom on.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-remake/">February</a>, in a video on his YouTube channel, in response to a question about remaking the first Devil May Cry game, Kamiya said that he would love to go back and remake Devil May Cry, and even added in that he wants to go back to Viewtiful Joe as well.</p>
<p>Once again, in a video on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HidekiKamiya_Channel"> YouTube channel</a>, when asked the same question, Kamiya gave the same answer.</p>
<p>"<em>As for a Devil May Cry remake, of course I'd love to do that. I usually don't replay my own games after release, and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design. With today's technology and game design approach, of course, I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happen...well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes,I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="“**** remake?” “**** sequel?” &quot;Capcom—Please leave it to me!&quot; Comment Reply Part 11!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOBoqQCcRTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, it's not a surprise that he gave the same answer. It seems like he doesn't mind being asked the question, as it gives him yet another chance to very publicly declare to Capcom and anyone who will listen that he wants to go back to Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>DMC and Viewtiful Joe also aren't the only games he'd want to revisit, as he also previously said he'd love to work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/">Scalebound</a> again, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya is one of the industry's most renowned and respected creators, who is partly responsible for some of gaming's most iconic and beloved series. It would be very interesting to see how he'd approach a remake for Devil May Cry, so hopefully someone at Capcom is paying attention.</p>

			<p>All those who purchase the retail edition of DOOM: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 will need to download the full game to play it, according to a new report.</p>
<p>As reported today by Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPE</a>, users who managed to get their hands on early physical copies of the new entry in the series by id Software confirmed that the game box indicates that an internet connection is required to play the game, which won't even start without one. This is because the disk includes only a small amount of data, around 400 MB, and, as such, the entire game must be downloaded first. Making matters worse, as highlighted by PPE, is the fact that publisher Bethesda hasn't clarified the matter so close to the game's release next week, other than the complete waste of a disc to only include what presumably are only licenses to launch the digital download of the game.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to ramp up the demon-slaying experience of the series to new heights with new mechanics and elevate it past that of its two immediate predecessors. Our review will be up shortly, but in the meantime, you can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview.</a></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 15th worldwide.</p>
