			<p>Typically, when a game experiences a rough launch or a development team decides to downsize, it isn't good news. While Starbreeze has downsized the Payday 3 team, it doesn't seem that there are planned layoffs, which, in the current climate of the game industry, is great news. When it comes to games that were highly anticipated and then flopping, Payday 3 is pretty high on the list. Even Starbreeze is aware of the fact that the game launched unsuccessfully. As a result, they've now downsized the team, as reported in <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbreeze's interim report</a>.</p>
<p>In the report, CEO Mats Juhl states "in the coming months, investment will be lower as we round off 'Operation Medic Bag' for Payday and therefore enter Year 2 with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content." The report did not specify how downsizing the team will affect Payday exactly and whether it will affect the frequency of updates in Payday 3. This means that <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/">the updates</a> will be smaller or less frequent. Despite the fact that the team has downsized and that Payday 3 didn't perform quite to their expectations, the report says that Starbreeze "remains financially strong," which is a good sign for a company in today's climate.</p>
<p>In the report, there was no mention of any layoffs, which is a pretty good sign. Hopefully this means that the staff have been relocated elsewhere within the company, or that they have already landed on their feet. While Payday 3 wasn't quite so successful, Juhl does mention that the recent DLCs that have been released for Payday 3 were well received, providing a glimmer of hope for Starbreeze. Although Payday 3's sales weren't up to scratch, the company's overall revenue has been cushioned nicely by the "relatively stable sales of Payday 2," a game that players found themselves returning to instead of playing Payday 3.</p>
<p>While the report predominantly focuses on the financial updates of the company, and how their current games are performing, there is also mention of Project Baxter, a dungeons &amp; Dragons project that "continues at full speed," with the report going on to state that there are internal playtests taking place, with a lot of "active discussions" happening with a lot of industry-leading companies.</p>
<p>While Starbreeze is known for making the iconic Payday franchise,&nbsp; they have also made games such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. They've also started to dip their toes into publishing, with Dead by Daylight being one of the most well-known titles that they've published.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-and-synthesis-details-revealed-for-atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>

<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in several interviews last week. In the second half of the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> with Game File's Stephen Totilo, published over the weekend, the executive said that he'd rather revisit some of Microsoft's many owned intellectual properties than rely on licensed games any further.</p>
<p><em>I'm not the biggest fan [of making licensed games]. It creates some complexities for us when we think about putting it in a subscription or streaming it. We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted because you lose certain licenses. So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, that the team has a goal around what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft does have two big triple-A licensed games in development at Bethesda's MachineGames and Arkane Lyon: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-official-concept-art-shared-by-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Blade</a>, respectively, both of which are IPs owned by Disney. On that partnership, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team. I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the intellectual property that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.</em></p>
<p>It's not hard to understand why Phil Spencer would feel that way: Disney isn't known for licensing its prized IPs cheaply. Moreover, Microsoft really does have access to a boatload of unused intellectual properties, from Rare's beloved Conker and Banjo-Kazooie to Killer Instinct and all the IPs from the latest acquisitions (Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>Spencer is also known for wearing t-shirts of some of these classic franchises, like Hexen or, more recently, Starcraft, during the Xbox TGS 2024 live broadcast. This gets fans excited about the prospect of reviving those IPs, and today's comments will undoubtedly fuel more chitchat in the respective communities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Portal 2 RTX Remix mod is now available for download, introducing path tracing to the amazing puzzle game released by Valve over ten years ago.</p>
<p>Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility mod, developed by xoxor4d, greatly enhances the game's visuals with path tracing and works surprisingly well despite RTX Remix not being intended to support the game. There are some issues here and there, as the game's effects are rendered using shaders, and performance isn't the best, which isn't surprising considering how demanding path tracing is even in older games, but this mod is a perfectly viable way to experience one of the best games ever released by Valve.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out this Portal 2 RTX Remix mod before downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>, you can check it out in action in the video below shared by gabdeg on YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal 2 with RTX Remix Compatibility Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yORRCNjgVxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series developed by Valve. Released in 2011, the game takes everything that made the original amazing and ups it to eleven, introducing a new set of puzzles as well as a two-player cooperative mode featuring a story, test chambers, and characters completely different from the single-player campaign. You can learn more about the game by heading over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam store page.</a></p>
