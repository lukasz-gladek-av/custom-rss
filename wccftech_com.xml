			<p><strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> isn't ready to release its next mainline entry into <strong>The Witcher </strong>series just yet, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong> was absent from recent shows like <strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">won't arrive until "<em>at least</em>" <strong>2027</strong> according to CDPR</a>. That said, we are getting a new Witcher game much sooner than next year, with <strong>Reigns: The Witcher</strong>, a new "<em>swipe'em up</em>" game from developer <strong>Nerial</strong> and publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, arriving on PC and mobile devices on <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Reigns: The Witcher takes you back through Geralt's adventures, though not exactly in the same way they played out in the original story. Instead, all of his adventures are told through the bard, Dandelion. You'll swipe left or right at different points in the adventure to steer the story one way or another, before the tale ends with Geralt faced with an untimely demise, in one way or another.</p>



<p>At the end of every run, Dandelion adds to his log of tales to be told on stage, increasing your ability to string together a truly gripping story, even if it's one that doesn't exactly stay true to how you remember it happening originally.</p>

<p>This is the sixth entry in Nerial's Reigns series, which will officially be a full decade old this coming August 2026. After the initial <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/?curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns </a></strong>title and its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/717640/Reigns_Her_Majesty/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Her Majesty</a></strong> follow-up, Nerial immediately started applying the formula to other franchises, to great success, with Reigns games based on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/897820/Reigns_Game_of_Thrones/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Game of Thrones</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437040/Reigns_Three_Kingdoms/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Three Kingdoms</a></strong>. The studio also has a sci-fi variant called <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663400/Reigns_Beyond/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns: Beyond</a></strong>, which was the most recent release before the upcoming The Witcher variant.</p>



<p>Nerial is also the same studio behind one of 2022's more intriguing indie games, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Card Shark</a></strong>, which turned plenty of heads with its striking visual style and deceitful gameplay.</p>



<p>Even though we'll have to wait until 2027 for The Witcher 4, hopefully, this spin-off Reigns title isn't the last we hear about The Witcher in 2026, and we'll have an official word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">on the rumoured <strong>The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> </a>that is said to arrive sometime this year.</p>

			<p><strong>Hytale,</strong> the <strong>Minecraft-like</strong> MMO that went through a long journey of <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">the game being acquired by a major publisher</a>, only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">to be shut down by said publisher</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">saved by its original creators</a>, and finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">put in players' hands earlier this month</a>, has reached another milestone, further marking its meteoric resurrection.</p>



<p>The game is officially one of the "<em>fastest-growing mod communities</em>" on the popular mod platform <strong><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></strong>, with Hytale players downloading <strong>more than 10 million mods</strong> for the game, with a little more than <strong>2,000 mod creators</strong> supplying more than <strong>3,000 mods</strong> in just two weeks.</p>



<p>CurseForge has been the official mod platform for Hytale since it launched, and <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> founder and chief executive officer, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, even credits the platform as a part of Hytale's success.</p>



<p>"<em>I have no regrets saving Hytale, and that’s entirely because of the community and our partners like CurseForge and Tebex who have made our early access launch a massive success</em>," Collins-Laflamme said in a press release. "<em>We came full circle, starting as modders and turning it into a game. Seeing fans build mods, worlds, and experiences at this scale, just weeks after launch, just validates why rebuilding was worth the risk</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Uri Marchand,</strong> chief executive officer and co-founder of CurseForge's operating company,<strong> Overwolf</strong>, added, "<em>Games are better when players get to create alongside the developers</em>. <em>From teenagers experimenting with the endless UGC possibilities to seasoned modders who have achieved a billion downloads, we’re giving Hytale creators a real path to build, share, and earn from their work through CurseForge and Tebex</em>."</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme has also been highlighting mods on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, further reiterating his love for Hytale's foundations as a mod itself.</p>

<p>Hytale kicked off to an impressive start, with Hypixel Studios reporting a "<em>very high</em>" number of concurrent users when the game launched earlier this month. Even before it launched, Collins-Laflamme announced that the game had already sold so well on pre-orders alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/"><strong>the next two years of development costs</strong> for Hypixel Studios were already funded</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the mods that Collins-Laflamme has highlighted, its modding community is also already pulling off some incredible feats. One mod that is not yet public but is particularly impressive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-crossplay-support-with-minecraft-thanks-to-impressive-mod/">added <strong>crossplay support </strong>between Hytale and Minecraft</a>. Two completely separate (albeit very similar) games, speaking to each other and allowing players in Hytale to play alongside their friends in Minecraft. It'll be even more impressive if/when the mod is made public. </p>
