			<p>A recent patent filed by Nintendo strongly suggests that voice chat will be integrated into the Nintendo Switch 2 operating system, addressing one of the original Switch's biggest oversights.</p>
<p>The patent, which was <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/pdfRedirectDownload/20250058223?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI0YjEwOGFlNS0yYjc4LTRlMzQtOTRiYi1kNjZkZDNlMDZiNmEiLCJ2ZXIiOiJlZjViYmE5NC1hMDAxLTQyNzUtOTM1ZC03NTMyY2MyNjE5ZjAiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> late last month by Nintendo in the United States, outlines a system for implementing proximity chat in games, suggesting not only OS voice chat integration for the Nintendo Switch 2, but also that first-party titles will likely support proximity chat, which could considerably improve multiplayer games like the next entry in the Mario Kart series or a potential new entry in the Splatoon series.</p>
<p>Voice chat support directly on the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be confirmed, but it's been speculated over the months that the mysterious new C button on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/">Joy-Con controller</a> could have something to do with it. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn what the new button does and how the new system will improve the user experience over its predecessor, as the dedicated Nintendo Direct focused on the console, which will likely be out <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">before the end of summer</a>, will air in less than a month.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide. We will keep you updated on the highly anticipated system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-seed-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-gem-in-the-making.1129869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steel-seed-hands-on-preview-a-gem-in-the-making/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing an original experience is becoming increasingly difficult in the video game industry, due both to the market's failure to always reward truly innovative games and the objective difficulty of creating something that hasn't already been done and making it fun. Still, plenty of titles inspired by gaming greats have managed to carve out a space in the industry thanks to the quality of the experience they offer.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like it will be the case with Steel Seed, a stealth action-adventure game in development by Storm in a Teacup, a small Italian development studio that has released some pretty unique indie games like N.E.R.O. - Nothing Ever Remains Obscure, Enki, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/close-to-the-sun-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Close to the Sun</a>, which attempted to do something different from the norm to varying degrees of success. With their latest game, on the other hand, the Italian studio seems to be playing it a little safely, as Steel Seed is a game that draws inspiration from other linear action-adventure titles like the Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series, featuring some light platforming and parkour and a combat system that's vaguely reminiscent of a Soulslike game. This, however, could be the best for the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the experience felt almost immediately familiar in the short 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try, the combination of elements from different games and their quality is sure to set the game apart from its illustrious inspirations. Set in a dark sci-fi world where humanity is on the brink of destruction, Zoe wakes herself up from what felt like a very long slumber to discover herself changed with a robotic body that grants her abilities far superior to those of a regular human. Lost in a world she doesn't recognize, Zoe sets out together with the mysterious drone KOBY to find her father and obtain the answers she seeks, only that this new world she woke up in won't make it very easy for her, as it is filled with machines out to take her down.</p>
<p>Steel Seed is clearly going for a cinematic approach, which feels well-realized already a few minutes into the adventure with some impressive set pieces like a giant robot going after Zoe and her companion drone, but developer Storm in a Teacup is clearly doing things right regarding gameplay as well. While the game employs a Soulslike combat system without a stamina system with light and heavy attacks and dodging, which can become a perfect dodge when timed correctly, as the sole defensive option, at least in the beginning, it implements these features well, thanks to how enemies react to hits, and how responsive Zoe feels to control. The challenge level also seems to be on point, as the enemies in the first area hit hard and don't just stand still taking hits. Over the course of the adventure, it will be possible to expand Zoe's skills to perform more complex maneuvers that will make combat feel more varied than in the first few minutes of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164614_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another big part of the Steel Seed experience will be the stealth mechanics, which also felt well put together in the short demo I played. Moving from one cover to another, Zoe will have to be extra careful avoiding and taking enemies down with instant takedowns, as their AI is mostly on point, making them react properly to Zoe's presence and alerting others in case she is found out. Overall, the stealth mechanics at the beginning of the game are somewhat straightforward, but they are well put together, and they are sure to evolve over the course of the game with more complex level design and an increased involvement of KOBY, who will be able to scan the environment unseen to help Zoe plan a course of action. Best of all, stealth sequences don't seem forced, although going straight for the enemy will put Zoe at a clear disadvantage due to the enemies' higher numbers.</p>
<p>With an interesting setting that sets up some compelling mysteries right off the bat, great responsiveness, solid gameplay mechanics, and some impressive visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed has the chance of becoming one of the surprises of this packed 2025. I did not know anything about the game, but the short demo I tried was enough to make me very interested in a game I feel will surprise many when it launches later this year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-introduces-highly-requested-feature-still-missing-from-the-vanilla-game.1129791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Monster Hunter Wilds shared online today introduces yet another highly-requested feature that is still missing from the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Layer Any Weapon mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/496?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a very simple Layered Weapon system that allows hunters to layer the appearance of any weapon onto the currently equipped one, similar to what is possible to do in the vanilla game with armor. Given how the strongest weapons in the game, the Artian weapons, don't have the best looks in most cases, this mod is a must for those who want to look at something other than the mechanical design of these weapons.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the game last month, plenty of mods were released online addressing some of Monster Hunter Wilds' biggest issues, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/">performance</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/">low challenge level</a>. Even with these issues, however, the latest entry in the series proved to be very successful, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">8 million units in 3 days</a>, the fastest ever for CAPCOM. The game's success, in my opinion, is completely deserved, as it is a very solid game that's really fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch.1129773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ESRB has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the official rating for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, sparking inevitable discussions about the game's imminent debut on Sony's console.</p>
<p>This title went back and forth several times. It was already planned to go fully multiplatform in the beginning, but then Microsoft renegotiated the deal with Disney and Lucasfilm after its acquisition of Bethesda to make it a PC and Xbox exclusive. However, by the time the game actually got its final release date, Microsoft had shifted its policy toward multiplatform releases. At Gamescom 2024, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would launch in December for PC and Xbox and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5. The latest rumors point to a release on Sony's console sometime next month and today's finding of the ESRB rating certainly supports this theory.</p>
<p>MachineGames has already published a few post-release updates, although to be fair, the game was already great at launch, as I discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Still, some of those improvements could come in handy for this new version. The game now supports fully ray traced shadows; moreover, the most recent update <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> support for path tracing on AMD (and Intel GPU) and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation integration. Given that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-an-impressive-ray-tracing-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a great ray tracing implementation on the Xbox Series X</a>, it is possible the developers might push it even further on the PlayStation 5 Pro, which features several hardware-based ray tracing optimizations.</p>
<p>Could this game be the first path traced title available on the PS5 Pro? Maybe. When we floated the idea of path tracing for Sony's console <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, he remained cautious, adding that developers 'need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro'. Well, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is likely the most optimized path tracing game available right now, so there's no better candidate in theory. We'll see if MachineGames actually tries it or sticks with a more conservative enhanced ray tracing target.</p>
