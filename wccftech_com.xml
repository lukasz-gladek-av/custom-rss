			<p>An Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake from Ubisoft being in the works is one of the videogame industry's currently running open secrets. It's not been officially announced, but there have been several <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/">rumors</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">leaks</a> pointing towards it being in development for years now, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">previously confirmed that remakes of Assassin's Creed games are coming</a>. </p>



<p>But as it's still not officially confirmed, everything we know about it should, technically, be taken with a grain of salt. Today, a new rumor from Jeux Vid√©o Magazine, who have previously reported accurate unannounced information about the Assassin's Creed series, added more salt to the pile, though in a slightly unexpected way.</p>



<p>In the video, Jeux Vid√©o Magazine alleges that there are a few significant changes being made to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag for this remake. One major change is that the game will reportedly lean more into the RPG side of Assassin's Creed that's been building since the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Edward will even have stats for his gear.</p>



<p>Jeux Vid√©o Magazine also claims that the parts of the game set in the modern day are being removed and replaced by more time spent with Edward Kenway on various pirating adventures. The map isn't getting bigger, but there will be new quests and more to do in the game, loading screens between being in your ship and being on land are gone, it'll bring back content that was cut from the game back in 2013, and it'll be out sometime in the first half of 2026, potentially during March, were among the other big claims Jeux Vid√©o Magazine made regarding the remake.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Again, the remake itself hasn't even been confirmed by Ubisoft, so take all of these claims with the appropriate amount of salt, even considering that Jeux Vid√©o Magazine has been right with leaks similar to this in the past. </p>



<p>But if even a few of those claims end up being true, specifically the removal of modern-day elements and the gameplay changes to make everything lean more towards Ubisoft's RPG era of Assassin's Creed games, then this will be a fairly significant remake compared to the original.</p>



<p>It also opens up interesting thoughts about the rest of the remakes Guillemot has confirmed Ubisoft is working on. Will the rest of the series get a makeover to be closer to the RPGs of late? Are each of the modern-day sections in the games going to be overhauled in some way? Ubisoft has previously discussed that it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-talks-about-the-modern-setting-storyline-in-shadows/">struggled with merging the modern-day story into its historical epics</a>. Could this be a step towards beginning to do away with it or permanently change it?</p>



<p>Those, and a lot more questions, open up if some of these alleged changes end up being true. We'll see what the truth is when Ubisoft finally does announce the remake.</p>
