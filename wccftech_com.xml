			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to be the best-looking console version of the game, as it will come with some exclusive features not available on the base console and on Xbox systems.</p>
<p>As confirmed today on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation blog</a>, the next entry in the series by Ubisoft, launching later this month, will offer multiple display modes on both base PS5 and PS5 Pro, which will all target 4K resolution via upscaling. Interestingly enough, all display modes will support ray tracing in some capacity, although Performance Mode on the base console will only offer selective ray tracing, which enables ray-traced global illumination in the Hideout. On PlayStation 5 Pro, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will offer extended ray tracing features, which enable ray-traced global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game, in its Fidelity Mode targeting 30 FPS gameplay, and its Balanced Mode targeting 40 FPS.</p>
<p>Together with the new details on Assassin’s Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro display modes, Ubisoft also released 20 minutes of new gameplay footage showcasing Naoe and Yasuke infiltrating Nijo Palace. You can check out the new footage below.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is setting out to be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, as Ubisoft detailed last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">Gamescom.</a></p>

			<p>A new Marvel's Spider-Man 2 patch is now live on PC, introducing CPU and GPU performance improvements, ray tracing fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's Patch 4 focuses on performance improvements, introducing CPU and GPU performance optimizations related to ray tracing and performance improvements in areas with sand. The new patch also addresses issues related to ray tracing, such as an issue that caused characters to appear darker than they should have when Ambient Occlusion was set to XSeGTAO, ray-traced reflections issues, ambient occlusion and ray-traced shadows, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also introduces fixes for other issues, such as certain settings getting reset when the game is restarted, crashing issues on quad-core processors, and more. Full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/497189343402656156?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launched in a rather poor state back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">January</a>, but PC port developer Nixxes released multiple patches that addressed some of the most common launch complaints, including crashing issues. The previous patch, which went live<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-patch-1-212-1-0-screen-space-reflections-dlss-ray-reconstruction/"> last month</a>, introduced a few more fixes, including one that finally allowed users to enable DLSS Ray Reconstruction when running the game at native resolution.</p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series developed by Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>
