			<p>Although one, if not the <strong>most iconic sequence</strong> in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has already been recreated in<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, there are still a lot of beautiful moments left to recreate in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em>. One of these moments, which takes place near the end of the original, was one the series director was looking forward to recreating, and he believes the team did <strong>full justice to it.</strong></p>



<p>As reported in a recent <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">livestream</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vinesauce</strong></a> had the chance to participate in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a casual gathering </strong>which took place after a promotional event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em></strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> </strong>with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in New York City earlier this month. Unsurprisingly, the<strong> third part of the remake trilogy</strong> was briefly mentioned when Hamaguchi-san revealed which <strong>part of the story yet to be remade he was more looking forward to.</strong></p>



<p>Through an interpreter, Hamaguchi-san said that the moment he was looking forward to recreating the most was <em>"Cloud finding himself with the help of Tifa,</em>" which is one of the <strong>most intense and emotional parts of the Final Fantasy VII story</strong>. While he did not discuss much about how the scene was recreated in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</em>, Hamaguchi-san stated that <em>"they nailed it,"</em> a strong statement that is sure to make every fan of the game quite excited about what is in store for the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Besides seeing the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">emotional impact</strong> this particular moment will have with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current-generation graphics</strong> and with the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> superb voice acting</strong> that Cody Christian and Britt Bratton already delivered for Cloud and Tifa in the first two entries in the series, it will be very interesting to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much the scene will have been changed</strong>, with Tifa's brief first venture in the Lifestream in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which doesn't happen in the original, and Cloud's already being partially aware of his past and the truth behind the Nibelheim incident. No matter what, I know I am really looking forward to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Gamers Are Not Actually Opposed to AI, But Rather People Exploitation and Slop”, Says Dev Behind AI-Powered Game Bobium Brawlers]]></title>

			<p>Game developer <strong>Studio Atelico</strong> is announcing its AI-powered debut game, <strong>Bobium Brawlers</strong>, today. It's a turn-based card and dice creature battler game currently targeting mobile platforms (iOS to start, where it's set to launch later this year) with a specific twist: players can create the creatures that will be in their deck simply by describing them to the so-called Studio Atelico AI Engine. </p>



<p>Crucially, the AI engine will run on-device, ensuring privacy, low latency, and no additional costs. Because of this, Bobium Brawlers will only run on models equipped with relatively recent versions of the <strong>Neural Engine</strong>, probably from <strong>iPhone 13</strong> onward. Of course, the developers also created many decks and cards to train the engine to follow those examples when creating new cards.</p>



<p>In a remote presentation attended by Wccftech, Art Director <strong>Mollie Boorman</strong> explained that <strong>Studio Atelico employs a team of human artists who have created extensive training assets</strong>. These images were paired with descriptions to train the model. She clarified that <strong>this game simply could not have been made without AI</strong>, as it allows players to create unique artwork in minutes. However, they are not using AI for everything.</p>



<p>Moreover, the studio paid artists to develop the visual style and to create the bulk of the non-creature art featured in Bobium Brawlers, and <strong>continues to pay them for the styles they created, including royalties for creatures generated in-game using their training assets</strong>. Their ethical approach was described as distinctly pro-artist, pro-player, and pro-human, <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/game-ai-art-without-losing-your-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in a blog post on their website a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>After the presentation, given the strong anti-AI stance of many hardcore gamers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as seen recently with the debacle surrounding <strong>Larian</strong> and their upcoming <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), it's no wonder that the very first question in the roundtable interview addressed the elephant in the room: is the studio ready to face backlash?</p>



<p>Studio Atelico CEO and co-founder <strong>Piero Molino</strong> explained that he sympathizes with the profound reasons behind this growing sentiment among gamers, but also clarified that he doesn't believe gamers are actually anti-AI; rather, they are opposed to "slop" and the exploitation of humans that is sometimes associated with it.</p>



<p><em>I understand that stance for two reasons. One, because of how most tech companies are adopting this technology without providing for the people who made it possible, which are, in the case of image generators, the artists whose images the generators have been trained on. It makes total sense why there is this kind of pushback; I totally understand that. We are approaching it from a different point of view: paying artists and giving them royalties on what is being generated. </em></p>



<p><em>We do not want to exploit anyone; we want to use that technology to create new mechanics that were not possible before. <strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and "slop." These are both things that we are trying very strongly to avoid</strong>. We are supporting the people who make it possible to create these models and we are not creating slop. We are trying to have a specific art style that is tailored to our specific game, thanks to the work our artists are doing. We hope to disentangle the general sentiment towards AI and show what is possible when you use it in a very positive way.</em></p>

<p>Later in the interview, Molino added that in the very first version of Bobium Brawlers, <strong>some parts of the AI Engine will run in the cloud, but only a very small amount</strong>, and the studio plans to move those on-device as well in the future. Because they are just small parts, the cost for Studio Atelico is very low: less than one cent per creature creation overall. Molino reckons bringing the cost of AI engines in games to zero or close to it is crucial for the technology to actually spread in more titles.</p>



<p>When it comes to the game mechanics, the duels will be quick 1v1 battles that blend card mechanics with dice-rolling action. Players will be able to use clever combos and tactical improvisation, rather than grinding or chasing the meta, to win matches.</p>



<p>The bigger question, though, is whether you agree with the studio's approach and the CEO's view on why gamers are so vehemently anti-AI. Let us know in the poll and comments below!</p>

			<p><strong>DayZ</strong> creator <strong>Dean Hall</strong> and <strong>Rocketwerkz's</strong> PvE sci-fi survival game <strong>ICARUS</strong> makes its console debut next month, on <strong>February 26, 2026,</strong> publisher <strong>GRIP Studios</strong> has announced. This comes after it was revealed in October 2025 that the game would be making its way to consoles at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<p>The console version will include the base game and the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>, which includes eleven additional animals between three new cats, five new dogs and three new horses, each with their own levels, talent tree, and requirements to help them survive alongside you.</p>



<p>The game's arrival on console comes five years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-the-co-op-survival-game-from-dean-hall-just-got-delayed-to-november/">it first launched on PC back in 2021</a>. While the game didn't arrive in the best shape, in the last six years, Rocketwerkz has consistently updated and improved the game and has been rewarded with a dedicated player base.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>With the New Frontiers expansion adding the alien region of <strong>Prometheus</strong>, players jumping into ICARUS for the first time will have <strong>128km2</strong> of ground to cover and conquer as they try to survive the hostile world around them.</p>



<p>When GRIP Studios announced ICARUS would be coming to consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/">Wccftech had the chance to speak to the game's creator, Dean Hall,</a> who confirmed a few bits of info worth remembering as we approach its console release date.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is no crossplay between PC and console players, nor is there crossplay between PS5 and Xbox Series X/S console players. If you want to play with your friends, you'll all have to be on one platform.</p>



<p>Of course, that could change with GRIP Studios continuing to work towards adding crossplay support, but there's no guarantee it'll happen. The same goes for a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> edition, something that GRIP Studios won't necessarily focus on until after the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S editions are out the door.</p>
