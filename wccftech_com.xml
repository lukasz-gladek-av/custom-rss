			<p>Two months ago, the long-running Oblivion remake rumors (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated</a> from the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit 'leak' from two years back) intensified greatly following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed report</a> from MP1st.</p>
<p>That report mentioned Virtuos had been working on porting The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. Virtuos previously worked on Obsidian's The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition and is a co-development partner for Konami's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>According to the report, the remake features improvements in six key areas (other than the visuals, which is a given): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and Heads Up Display.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has also been improved and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system has also been tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, the developers have reportedly improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing in third or first person view.</p>
<p>Now, leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that Bethesda could officially unveil this Oblivion remake in March or April at the latest, with a release that could come shortly afterward. The insider added that June was the original target, but the launch could happen even sooner. VideoGamesChronicle has subsequently not only backed Nate's rumor but also <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the remake could be released as early as next month.</p>
<p>Of course, the 2006 open world roleplaying game doesn't need a lot of marketing. Fans are already very excited to be getting not one but two renditions when you factor in Skyblivion, the fan-made recreation of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Are you ready to return to the Imperial City?</p>

			<p>The official trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 that premiered on Saturday at SXSW broke HBO viewership records. According to Warner Bros. Discovery (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-viewership-record-hbo-1236324465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a>), the trailer was viewed 158 million times across various platforms in just three days, a record for any HBO/Max original show in the same timeframe. It goes without saying that the trailer also outperformed previous trailers of the show itself by at least 160%.</p>
<p>It's not the first time the show has made news for its excellent viewership results. It was the second most-viewed HBO premiere of the last decade after George R.R. Martin's House of the Dragon, and it subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-tv-sets-hbo-record-for-pilot-to-episode-2-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the biggest pilot-to-episode-two growth, capturing 5.7 million viewers in the United States when it first aired a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>According to WBD, Season 1 episodes have averaged around 32 million viewers to date in the United States, or around four times the same-day audience of the first season's finale episode, which also marked a record for same-day viewership with 8.2 million viewers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there's a lot of anticipation ahead of the debut of The Last of Us Season 2, which will consist of seven episodes. The first of these airs on April 13 on HBO Max and the finale is scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>The new season will adapt a portion of the plot gamers witnessed in The Last of Us Part II, with more to come in future seasons (showrunner Craig Mazin said there's material for at least one or two additional seasons). Franchise creator Neil Druckmann explained there will be some differences from the source material, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also be available on PC</a> when The Last of Us Part II Remastered hits the platform on April 3.</p>
<p>Druckmann also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-could-be-it-for-the-last-of-us-says-series-creator-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mused</a> that a third entry in the gaming series may never come to pass, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his passion for Naughty Dog's new upcoming sci-fi IP</a> points in that direction. On the other hand, perhaps the viewership numbers, if confirmed throughout the whole season, could sway Sony into asking him to make at least another game in the future.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Season 2 is set around five years after the finale of the debut season, with Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) grappling with the consequences of saving Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey). Other returning characters include Joel's brother Tommy (played by Gabriel Luna) and Maria (played by Rutina Wesley). There will be a lot of new characters, such as Kaitlin Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Tati Gabrielle (who will also play the protagonist of Naughty Dog's upcoming game) as Nora, and Jeffrey Wright as Dixon, reprising his role from the game.</p>
