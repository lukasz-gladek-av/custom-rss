			<p>Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> leaves much to be desired in terms of optimization, with the right settings, it is possible to achieve noticeable performance improvements on multiple GPUs with minimal impact on the visuals.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, MxBenchmarkPC compares how the new entry in the series by Gearbox runs and looks at various resolutions on multiple GPUs ranging from the RTX 5080 and 4080 to the dated RTX 3080 and 3060 GPUs using both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR with and without Frame Generation, highlighting how the used optimized setting don't look much different from the Very High settings preset and deliver much better performance, up to 40% in some scenarios.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 Optimization - Up to 40% More FPS | RTX 5080, 5070, 4080, 4070, 4060, 3080, 3060" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HMAPk0Zmc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><em>Optimized Settings:<br>HLOD Loading Range: Far<br>Geometry Quality: High<br>Texture Quality: Very High (12GB), High (10GB), Medium (8GB)<br>Anisotropic Filtering Quality: x16<br>Foliage Density: High<br>Volumetric Fog: Medium<br>Volumetric Cloud: Medium<br>Shadow Quality: High<br>Directional Shadow Quality: High<br>Volumetric Cloud Shadows: Disabled<br>Lighting Quality: High<br>Reflections Quality: Medium<br>Shading Quality: Medium</em></p>



<p>Right at launch, it was clear how Borderlands 4 is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">most demanding games to run released this year</a>, and although it has already been patched with some performance and stability improvements, there's still a lot of work left to be done. The game's performance has prompted a heated discussion between users disappointed by how the game runs on their systems and Gearbox co-founder Randy Pitchford, who suggested that "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">4K stubborn" players</a> who don't have the hardware to play at that resolution should switch to 1440p resolution or take advantage of NVIDIA DLSS or other upscalers to achieve better performance. The discussion got so heated that Pitchford replied to one user telling the studio to make a game look good without AI upscale to <em>"code their own engine"</em> and show them how it's done.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

						<h5>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji</h5><p><span>September 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is hardly going to be remembered as the finest entry in the series or the best open-world game set in Feudal Japan, but the good the game does definitely outweighs the bad, making for an enjoyable experience whose real fault lies in the series' now trademark content bloat and the by-the-book open-world ARPG experience rather than in the bad execution of any of its features.</p>



<p>Coming only a few months after the base game, no one should have expected the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion to address any of the issues of the base game, and it doesn't, indeed. If anything, it makes abundantly clear how the quantity over quality approach behind the series is what is holding it back the most, as the good the expansion does is heavily diluted by quest and world design aimed at expanding the total playtime without actually offering anything interesting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji begins rather well with one of the most unique quests in the entire game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji is an endgame expansion and, as such, can only be accessed after the main story and the personal quests of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro have been completed. There's a story justification for this, as the expansion is centered around the recovery of the last regalia on Awaji Island and a brief war against Kimura Yukari, the daughter of the Templar Kimura Kei whom Yasuke already dealt with. After a short first quest that does an excellent job introducing the current state of Awaji Island in a believable Japanese way, Naoe and Yasuke travel to the island to save Naoe's mother, Tsuyu, recover the regalia, and put an end to yet another Templar in Japan.</p>



<p>Being around 5 hours long, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji story isn't particularly deep, but it's entertaining enough with some high points at the beginning and the end. The new characters around which the main quest is centered aren't well developed and fall in line with everything seen in the base game. Some are despicable individuals, no matter the angle; others fall more into a grey moral area where they are duty and honor-bound to serve the Templar lady, but none of their motivations are fully explored, making them nothing more than a device to move the story toward its conclusion. To be honest, no character or event in the expansion is bad to the point of being offensive, but they are so unremarkable that I would be surprised if anyone remembered much a few hours after completing the story.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji's story has some highlights but is mostly unremarkable.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my opinion, unremarkable is also the most apt description of Awaji Island and everything in it. Thanks to the technical improvements introduced in the Anvil Engine, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands as one beautiful open-world game with some standout locations, but the new island is definitely not going to be among them, as there is nothing in it that truly stands apart, as the entire new map, which is also rather small, seems to be some sort of rearranging of visual elements lifted from the base game. The actual design of the map also leaves something to be desired, as it is very predictable and features some areas in different parts that are almost identical. Also, at launch, Awaji Island is not as polished as the base game was, as I have encountered a good number of visual glitches that were hard to miss, including a glitch in the wind system which made leaves on the ground scatter as if there was an explosion beneath them. Nothing truly gamebreaking, but their frequency was definitely immersion breaking.</p>



<p>With an unremarkable story and map, it should be no surprise that Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji disappoints even in terms of content. This is where it's clear how going for quality over quantity may have helped a lot, as the best additions to the experience are really well done, such as the new Bo weapon for Naoe. This versatile weapon comes with tons of pretty useful skills, including one that can heal her with timed button presses, and a stance system that makes Naoe much better at fighting enemies head-on with options to push back, stagger, and knock down enemies. Yasuke, on the other hand, doesn't get any new weapon, but new skills for all of his weapon types that work quite well against a group of enemies, making them a welcome addition. Though not a gameplay addition, the entire questline focused on Nowaki, one of the central figures in the Sanzoku Ippa faction that dominates the island, is the highlight of the expansion, ending with a stealth-focused boss battle that reminded me of the boss fight against The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Bo weapon for Naoe is one of the best additions in Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the above are the only highlights of the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion. The rest of the content is recycled from the base game, with a mix of stealth and combat-focused quests that do nothing different. In some instances, this recycled content is even worse than the base game's content due to design decisions clearly motivated by the intent to extend playtime. Many quests, for example, begin at one of the ends of the island and continue to the opposite end. Without a fast travel point, the journey can take a few minutes which are as unremarkable as most of the time in the expansion, as the island's design is nothing to write home about, as already mentioned, the side activities are either the same seen in the base game, like drawing Sumi-e for Junjiro and the Kuji-kiri meditation points or strongholds and camps to clear, or slightly altered versions that don't add much. The decision to make the Sanzoku Ippa a very aggressive faction that is constantly on the hunt for Naoe and Yasuke is a nice touch that adds a bit of tension to potentially dull traversal, but at times, they are so aggressive that constantly getting sniped by a rifleman hidden in a bush, or falling into traps, becomes old fast, considering it is still very easy to get away from the assaulters with no consequences. The hunt for Tomeji's most trusted companions is another great example of the content bloat in the expansion. Although it is optional, going after these men is somewhat required to make the fight against Kimura Yukari's strongest warrior more manageable, but doing so doesn't add much to the experience, as, with some exceptions, they are regular enemies with more health and armor. When you spend more time looking for these targets rather than actually fighting them, it's clear how there's an issue.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji isn't a bad expansion, and those who loved the base game will probably find plenty to like in it if they are not tired of the formula. The main issue is that almost everything, from story and characters to map design, quest design, and optional content, is unremarkable and doesn't add anything new to the experience, with the exception of the new Bo weapon and the Nowaki questline, which are great, high-quality additions that definitely deserved better to shine even more.</p>

				<p>With average quest design, a lack of polish, and a forgettable story, Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji shows how the series’ quantity-over-quality approach is continuing to fail. While the Bo weapon for Naoe and the excellent Nowaki questline stand out, they’re drowned by questionable design choices that undermine the experience, making the expansion worthwhile only for the most die-hard fans.</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced the launch of Operation Nemesis, a major milestone for its MMOFPS EVE Vanguard. The studio has famously attempted to link its long-running sci-fi MMORPG EVE Online to a shooter game with the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/">Dust 514</a> and its spiritual successors that never saw the light of release, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Nova</a>. Despite the failures, CCP Games continued to find the right way to achieve that vision, and now they're one step closer with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-londons-game-is-a-genre-defining-hugely-ambitious-eve-shooter-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London studio's game</a>.</p>



<p>Starting with Operation Nemesis, Warclones on the ground (in EVE Vanguard) and Capsuleers in the cosmos (in EVE Online) will now influence the same conflict. Vanguard squads uncover intel that enables Capsuleers to reveal and raid Upwell convoys in space. This persistent economic and military connection unites boots-on-the-ground combat with interstellar warfare, giving players the power to shape the fate of New Eden together.</p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, Executive Producer at CCP Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Operation Nemesis marks a major milestone for EVE Vanguard. This is the first real taste of our much grander vision: We’re delivering a persistent, online sandbox shooter where your actions resonate across a living, player-driven universe. With the foundations in place, we’re now fusing new systems into the framework as we set the stage for Early Access. EVE Vanguard is growing with every milestone, and players are starting to see the boundless potential of the ultimate sci-fi experience we’re building: one universe, one war, fought across space and planets.</em></p>



<p>Scott Davis, Game Director for EVE Vanguard, added:</p>



<p><em>The feeling at CCP’s London studio is that we’re building the game of our dreams. EVE Vanguard represents our vision for a bold new FPS that combines the intensity of brutal combat with the depth and persistence usually reserved for MMOs. Operation Nemesis is the most significant step forward so far, giving fireteams and solo operators the chance to battle-test and influence the game ahead of next year’s Early Access launch. So grab your friends, squad up, and help us build it together. We’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what’s to come.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here's the full overview of the Operation Nemesis limited-time event (running through October 2 at 11 AM UTC):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>New Player Journey:</strong> An all-new, narrative-driven introduction to EVE Vanguard. Players will awaken as Warclones and discover their place in New Eden as they explore the EVE Universe.</li>



<li><strong>Expanded Arsenal:</strong> Wield a deadly new lineup of futuristic weapons, including a long-range rifle, a devastating shotgun, and a versatile energy pistol.</li>



<li><strong>Weapon Manufacturing:</strong> Craft and customize weapons in orbit to give Warclones more ways to adapt to evolving threats.</li>



<li><strong>Evolved Adversaries:</strong> Face off against distinct new enemy classes, such as the relentless Charger and the imposing Opressor, which add layers of challenge and unpredictability.</li>



<li><strong>New PvP Greybox Map</strong>: Experience intense 9v9 insurgency conflicts across a new greybox map: "Sulphur Basin," which expands opportunities for strategy and coordination.</li>



<li><strong>Expeditions:</strong> Warclones can accept assignments that align them with corporations and factions from across the EVE universe, unlocking unique rewards.</li>



<li><strong>Battlefield Systems:</strong> Proximity voice chat, Down But Not Out revival, and UI refinements enhance coordination and immersion.</li>
</ul>



<p>EVE Vanguard is still in Pre-Alpha. CCP is currently targeting an official debut <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1872800/EVE_Vanguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> in Summer 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-%E2%80%98secretly-console-first%E2%80%99-players-will-be-able-to-turn-off-crossplay-with-pc.1298940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is now only three weeks away from its October 10 launch date. Fans are counting down days following the successful beta, and the developers share more info through interviews. Yesterday, Technical Director Christian Buhl <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that having to optimize for a lower spec hardware like the Xbox Series S actually benefited the more powerful platforms, too.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Buhl and Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson have discussed the importance of delivering a great console experience in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Nickerson joked it was like the game was 'secretly console first'.  </p>



<p><em><strong>Christian Buhl:</strong> I could say we've been thinking about console and the console experience from the start of Battlefield 6. It has been a top-of-the-line thing. We have to build this game as if it was made primarily for console players. Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then ported to console, and it probably felt like that. That is not how this game was built. We built this from the beginning with the idea in mind that this is going to be on both console and PC. It has to feel and play like it is a console game that was built to be a console game.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Matthew Nickerson:</strong> We have a saying here in the office, in Ripple Effect when I joined the team, that I created, called 'Secretly Console First.’ It's a little moniker that kind of pokes fun. We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game, but we really have to care about console at the end of the day. We've been putting in the reps, putting in the work, just like Christian said. Console has been at the forefront of Battlefield 6 development since day one, and really, we're honed and we are well-crafted in providing this product at the highest quality possible.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, the two also shared that Battlefield 6 will offer console players the option to turn off cross-play with the PC version (which they may want to do in case of cheating issues) while maintaining cross-play between Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 consoles. When cross-play with PC is enabled, the matchmaking system will still look for console players first if you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation, only expanding the search to include PC if the lobby requires more players. Moreover, the developers have revamped aim assist compared to Battlefield 2042 to ensure cross-play is fair for all players.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing of the Battle Royale mode is ongoing on the Battlefield Labs platform</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-dk-island-emerald-rush-hands-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza%E2%80%99s-dk-island-emerald-rush-dlc-is-an-odd-mix-of-rare-and-roguelite.1298937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo often makes fans wait a spell for DLC or expansions for their favorite games, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">most recent Nintendo Direct</a> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, released only two months ago, was getting DLC the same day as the presentation. The DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC adds a new stage based on DK’s tropical home featured in Rare and Retro Studios’ games, as well as a new fast-paced roguelite mode.</p>



<p>Is the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC a gem or are its flaws all too apparent? Swing on down for my full impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As the title of the DLC implies, the centerpiece of Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is a new HD recreation of the big ape’s island home from the Donkey Kong Country games. Nintendo has really gone all out rendering DK Island in all its glory, packing it with familiar characters, landmarks, and plenty of Easter eggs. It’s a welcome addition to a game that’s really a celebration of the Donkey Kong franchise as a whole, although it is hard to overlook the fact that Super Mario Odyssey included something similar – a stage based on the classic Mushroom Kingdom – as an in-game unlockable, while DK Island is stuck behind a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Super Mario Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom was also fully integrated into the core game, offering fresh challenges to tackle and Power Moons to collect. The same can’t be said of DK Island. While the tropical locale looks nice and will give you fuzzy nostalgic feelings, it strangely sits apart from the main game. There are no new Banandium Gems or fossils to collect here, making the whole experience feel a bit too much like a superficial theme park attraction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At least that’s true until you jump into Emerald Rush mode, which DK Island was clearly designed around. Emerald Rush is essentially an accelerated take on the roguelite genre, with all the gold in the game turned into glittering green gems. Over a series of quick 99-second rounds, you’re challenged to collect a specific quantity of green goodness by smashing ore deposits, defeating enemies, and finding green bananas (again, bananas can only be found on DK Island in Emerald Rush mode). The number of rounds you have to survive depends on the difficulty you’ve chosen, but thankfully, finding emerald fossils will grant you stackable upgrades that will help you as the rounds get tougher.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Emerald Rush is fun enough, in a simple, smashy-smashy sort of way, although it condenses the roguelite experience to such a degree that it all starts to feel a bit meaningless. You'll be picking up a <em>lot</em> of fossils, requiring you to choose upgrades almost constantly. While I'm absolutely sure some folks will get <em>really</em> into strategizing and finding synergies between upgrades, I found myself succumbing to information overload fairly quickly.</p>



<p>In addition to DK Island, you can unlock the ability to play Emerald Rush on the majority of DK Bananza’s layers, and it will likely take a solid half-dozen hours or more to unlock all the DLC’s new content. Even then, you can pump up the difficulty on each layer for a new challenge. That said, I'm not sure how long the average player is going to stick with the mode. Emerald Rush reminds me a lot of the Balloon World DLC for Mario Odyssey, in that it's something I think <em>some</em> players will really get into, but will be largely ignored by most.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-not-a-knockout-follow-up-punch"><strong>Not a Knockout Follow-up Punch</strong></h2>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush isn't without its charms, but the titular island's lack of integration into the main game, Emerald Rush mode's relatively simple gameplay loop, and a substantial $20 price tag means this DLC will likely only appeal to a relatively small subset of Bananza owners. If you've read through these impressions and are still interested, by all means, dig in, but given how substantial the core Donkey Kong Bananza experience is, others may prefer to keep mining for fun there.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is available now on Switch 2 for $20.</p>
