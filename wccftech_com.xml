			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/">Devil May Cry 5</a> was CAPCOM's best-selling game for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, boosted by the Netflix anime show's launch in April.</p>



<p>In its report for Q1 FY2026, the Japanese publisher confirmed that the fifth entry in the series sold 1,782,000 units in April-June 2025, the only game by the publisher to achieve more than 1 million sales in the quarter. Street Fighter 6 is also reported to have been doing well, and thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 release, the latest entry in the legendary fighting game series has now surpassed five million units.</p>



<p>Looking at the report's Unit Sales ranking, it's impossible not to notice how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> hasn't performed all that well. The game only sold 477,000 units in the first quarter of the fiscal year, a sheer drop from the high sales reported in its launch window and barely surpassing Monster Hunter Rise. Hopefully, the development team will be able to turn things around and address the issues that have been putting off many players.</p>



<p>Besides confirming Devil May Cry 5's solid performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, CAPCOM has also reported significant growth, with net sales increasing by 53.7% year-on-year to ¥45,502 million, operating profit increasing by 90.8% to ¥24,597 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent increasing by 72.8% to ¥17,238 million. Impressive results, considering the publisher hasn't released any major titles in the quarter.</p>



<p>As a longtime fan of the series, I am happy to learn that Devil May Cry 5 is doing great on the market so many years after its release., showing CAPCOM how there's still a strong interest in Dante, Vergil and Nero's story. Hopefully, it won't take long to see another entry in the series, although longtime series director Hideaki Itsuno leaving CAPCOM<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/"> last year </a>likely impacted whatever the publisher is planning for the series.</p>

			<p>Electronic Arts (EA) reported its Q1 2026 financial results a few hours ago, beating expectations with a revenue of $1.3 billion (+4.84% over the estimates and 3% more than last year). This is certainly a great setup for the publisher ahead of highly anticipated game launches, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skate</a>, and The Sims through <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Rene</a>. Will EA join other publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Nintendo</a> in raising game prices beyond $70, though?</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like that's happening, at least for the time being. In the ensuing Q&amp;A with investors, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said (excerpt from <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-electronic-arts-q1-2026-beats-eps-estimates-93CH-4158698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Investing.com</a>):</p>



<p><em>We’re not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage, but that’s in the construct of we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We’ll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet.</em></p>



<p>That's great news for gamers interested in games such as Battlefield 6. It may be a conscious decision on EA's part. The publisher is looking to attract <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a big audience</a> for this new installment in the military shooter franchise, after all, and setting a price that many consumers are not comfortable with would be counterproductive.</p>



<p>EA has set the multiplayer reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tomorrow</a>. Livestreamed events will take place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London and kick off at 11:30 AM Pacific Time. We'll have our own Kai Tatsumoto in Los Angeles to play the game and report his first impressions.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-better-performance-ue4-valorant/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VALORANT, the competitive first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, was recently <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-02/">updated</a> to Unreal Engine 5.3, and, for once, the engine delivers better performance than its predecessor.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by MxBenchmarkPC puts the game running in Unreal Engine 4 and in Unreal Engine 5.3 side by side on a system powered by an RTX 4070 GPU, highlighting how the UE5.3 version of the game generally runs at higher framerates. Visuals, on the other hand, are almost identical, with only some marginal improvements, which was expected, considering the developer's statements before the patch went live and the competitive nature of the game. The new version of the game also shows an increase in CPU load, RAM and VRAM usage, which may impact some low-end machines, although no report has been shared regarding any massive performance issue on such systems.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's almost unbelievable to see a game powered by Unreal Engine 5 run so smoothly, without its known stuttering issues. Epic is well aware of these issues, and Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson recently hosted a talk aptly named T<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/">he Great Hitch Hunt</a> during Unreal Fest 2025, highlighting the causes of the widespread stuttering issues and providing some advice to developers to minimize the issues.</p>



<p>One of the latest games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is the soulslike WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Although far from being one of the UE5 games with the worst performance to date, the experience crafted by Leenzee Games still leaves something to be desired from a technical standpoint, as even a powerful GPU like my RTX 4080 needed Frame Generation to hit 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. You can learn more about these performance issues, which the development studios is currently working to improve, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch has gone live today, introducing many improvements and new features, including Frame Generation support on PC.</p>



<p>One of the biggest additions featured in the v1.4.0 patch is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS Frame Generation and Low Latency support, which allow users with compatible GPUs to enjoy smoother gameplay with lower input lag. The new patch also packs plenty of quality of life improvements, including a Battle Retry option allowing players to quickly retry after losing a battle, a Lumina Cost Display which clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability in the Pictos menu, an Autoplay dialogue option outside cutscenes, and separate volume sliders to adjust music volume for exploration and combat.</p>



<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch also features some balance changes, a few bug fixes and some visual polish improvements across multiple areas. You can learn more about these fixes by checking out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499454457318211676?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Even without the welcome improvements above, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a more than worthy RPG to experience at launch, thanks to its great character and story and an involving turn-based combat system. You can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a> to learn more about what makes the game developed by Sandfall Interactive one of the best role-playing games of the generation.</p>
