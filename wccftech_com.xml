						<h5>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</h5><p><span>October 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>Before I sat down in front of a television set with a controller in my hand to play a video game, I played games inches away from my face while squeezing my Game Boy for hours on end. There's many a childhood photo of me with my face buried in a handheld device, with a personal favourite being one where I'm deep into my Game Boy Advance SP on a beach. Those handheld beginnings and the handheld-focused gaming upbringing I had make me, in theory, one of the many who would get a lot of use out of a device like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>That is why I was honestly surprised to be so repulsed by the device when I finally had it in hand earlier this month. That repulsion died a bit before I spent some time checking out the new Xbox-branded ASUS ROG Ally at <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">an afternoon event in my hometown of Toronto since</a>, by that point, I had spent a week with the device. ASUS generously sent it over for this review, and I have now spent three weeks with it at the time of this publishing.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Full disclosure, I don't own a PC handheld myself - I've kept an eye on the Steam Deck, the ASUS ROG Ally and others like them, but beyond the fact that there are more important things than gaming hardware to spend money on at the moment, I flat out do not need one. I have a laptop and a desktop that get me by just fine, a PS5, an Xbox Series X, and a Nintendo Switch covering whatever games I may need or want to play. For myself, I can't justify the cost of any of them, let alone the newest and one of the most expensive ones on the market.</p>



<p>That's why getting to spend some serious time with one of these devices has been eye-opening. I have started to understand the appeal beyond the shallow level myself, and any other enthusiast is capable of seeing just from reading and hearing about these devices. It's simply an impressive thing to walk around with a device in my hands, playing games that I would have just a few short years ago never anticipated being playable in a handheld form factor. </p>



<p>Sure, it's old hat for the small millions of people who've already had their Steam Deck or ROG Ally or Lenovo devices for a couple of years now, but I'll admit that despite my initial distaste (which I'll explain), this is a truly impressive and, surely for some, a worthwhile device to own. I don't know who that person is, though, and even if you have $999 USD (or $1299 CAD) burning a hole in your pocket that can only be spent on video games and gaming-related things, I'd still caution you from picking one up yourself.</p>

<h3 id="h-initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>Let me begin by addressing why I was repulsed by the device at first. On a superficial level, right out of the box, I just don't think it looks that nice. I wouldn't go far enough to call it ugly, but it's not the slickest device out there. Maybe it's something about the controller-style grips on either side, but when looking at it head-on, it struggles to shake the 'controller they slapped a screen in the middle of' allegations.</p>



<p>To their credit, the controller grips on either side make holding the 715g device comfortable for any extended period, which you will almost certainly be doing thanks to an impressive battery life, even when playing on its Turbo 25w setting.</p>



<p>Backing up a bit to when I took it out of the box, inside you get a 65Wh charger to keep the Xbox Ally X fully charged and ready to go (it also boosts to a 35w Turbo-Turbo mode when plugged in), your bog standard manuals and warranty card, and a little cardboard stand stuck to the top of the box on the inside. After taking off the plastic covering the device, I had my initial repulsion, as we discussed, and I started getting it set up, which took far longer than it would have compared to anyone who just picks one up themselves.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I had to do several pre-release updates and follow a guide specifically because the unit I got didn't come with all the prepared day-one updates. Of course, you won't have to do that, but right away, even with an Xbox button on the side, it was clear that this is definitely not an Xbox.</p>



<p>It loads into the Xbox PC app, specifically the new UI refresh that's releasing with this device and its sibling ROG Xbox Ally, and will also be coming to the original ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update, and that certainly helps it feel like an Xbox and achieve the console-like experience it's going for. I also have to shoutout the fingerprint reader on the power button, which makes jumping back into the device extremely simple.</p>



<p>The buttons on the back are satisfyingly clicky, and the thumbsticks are comfortably placed. The ABXY buttons have a stickiness to them that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not too jarring. The triggers have a smooth pull, and the D-Pad, I'm very happy to say, as someone who loves platformers, works really well for even the more intense platforming titles like Celeste. Which is probably the game I've been playing on this the most in my time with it, both because it's an excellent game and because the D-Pad is great to use.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>I've been having a blast playing Celeste again on the ROG Xbox Ally X - but I'd also be having a blast playing it again on my Nintendo Switch. </em></figcaption></figure>

</figure>



<p>What I do not like about the layout, however, are the buttons on the top corners of the device on each side of the screen. There are five of them, two on one side and three on the other. It's at least two too many buttons. Either get rid of the Armoury Crate button, or the Xbox button on the left side. We don't need both, especially since they open the same side menu, and the Library button on top of the Menu button on the right side can go. I pressed it accidentally more than a few times, and once again, it brings me to an Armoury Crate menu I can get to through the Xbox button or the Armoury Crate button.</p>



<p>ASUS also sent over its official 2-in-1 hard-shell carrying case for the device, which does a great job of protecting the ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X when you're tossing it in your backpack or something. It also comes with a small pouch attached to the back of the case via velcro, so you can easily take the charger with you. It's a simple, solid black case, though the strap that holds the ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X in place does make it a little cumbersome to remove and put back quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-tech-specs">Tech Specs</h3>

<p>A little overview of the technical specifications, the chart below includes the tech specs for the ASUS ROG Ally, Ally X, Xbox Ally, and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is now the new top-end device for the ROG Ally line of handhelds, with its latest Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which doesn't add more cores but does seem to add plenty of value in terms of battery efficiency. It has faster memory, but the new processor, memory, improved USB ports, and the new console shape with the controller grips on either side are about where the hardware upgrades stop, compared to the ROG Ally X. Oh, and the addition of an Xbox button, of course.</p>

<h3 id="h-benchmarking-battery-life">Benchmarking/Battery Life</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X houses the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Beginning with battery life, after an hour of Red Dead Redemption 2 on Turbo mode, the battery was only down to 50%. Only losing half of the battery after starting with a full charge, while pushing the device on Turbo after an hour of playtime, might not sound like the best, but it's not bad in my book considering the fact that I've found I really don't need to be at the Turbo setting all the time to get solid performance out of whatever I'm playing.</p>



<p>When set to the 17w Performance mode, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X handled just about anything I've thrown at it, and while Turbo is impressive, knowing I can squeeze a significant amount more time out of the device, without having to tone down my playing experience, is one of the ROG Xbox Ally X's biggest features.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Part of that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I learned when I spoke to ASUS's Whitson Gordon and Sashca Krohn</a>, comes from the company's focus on ensuring that battery life is a priority, which meant not going with an OLED screen, and not giving up its power-efficient IPS display. As much as I'll always love an OLED display when I can get it, I can't knock the IPS display here. The 7", 1920x1080p, 16:9 IPS display at 500 nits with a 120Hz refresh rate is more than servicable. Would an OLED be nice? Sure. Would it make the device even more expensive and difficult to recommend than I already think it is? Undoubtedly. All that to say, I'm not miffed about the lack of an OLED.</p>



<p>Getting into some of the benchmarking I did, for context, I'm no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a>. I'm not able to provide analysis on that level, but I can share internal benchmark results from the games I tested that have internal benchmarks. To that end, I tried to test a good mix of games: Forza Horizon 5, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>



<p>In all of these games, save one, the common thread was that I could find ways to hit above 30 FPS, or even 60 FPS+, but keeping the frame rate consistent was always an issue. Forza Horizon 5 was the one game where I saw the game hit a consistent, smooth 60 FPS.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 5 benchmark test on the ROG Xbox Ally X, settings on High.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The built-in VRR helps smooth out the experience, but some games, like DOOM: The Dark Ages, I would just flat out not recommend playing on the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages Reckoning benchmark test at High settings on the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even at Low settings, I was unable to get it to a solid 60 FPS. Also, it looked awful.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>My Red Dead Redemption 2 benchmarks were much more promising. I consistently hit 40 FPS on the 17Wh power mode, even with the graphics settings at Ultra. It was only when I switched to the Silent 13Wh power mode that it dropped to 30 FPS.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Shadow of the Tomb Raider was a similar story in that the higher settings would be able to hit around 40 FPS on both the 25Wh and 35Wh Turbo mode and the 17Wh Performance mode, though, of course, it started to falter much more when dropped down to the 13Wh Silent mode. Still, it only dropped to 30 FPS, and if you're like me and you don't balk at something when it hits lower than 60 FPS, the fact that I could play a game like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, even at 30 FPS, on this machine's 13Wh Silent mode is impressive.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was, once again, the same story, with closer to 40 FPS on the 17Wh Performance battery mode, and 30 FPS on the 13Wh Silent battery mode. What separates Horizon Zero Dawn from the rest (besides Forza Horizon 5), however, is that you can run the game on its Favour Performance graphics settings, enjoy a slightly higher, closer to 50 FPS frame rate on the 17Wh mode, and it'll still look and feel great.</p>

</figure>



<p>There were other games I played to test them out, like God of War (2018), Elden Ring, Dying Light: The Beast, OlliOlli World, and Hell is Us. Elden Ring, for whatever reason, crashed almost every time I tried playing it. The first time, it was seemingly just because I used the volume buttons on top of the device. Two more times, it was seemingly because I tried to navigate the menu with the LB and RB buttons. Another was just in the middle of gameplay, for no discernible reason.</p>

</figure>



<p>I also crashed in Dying Light: The Beast, and that one was caused by going outside into Old Town from the Town Hall safe zone. Thankfully, that only happened once, but crashes aren't necessarily the ROG Xbox Ally X's fault.</p>



<h3 id="h-this-is-an-xbox">This Is An Xbox?</h3>



<p>At least to me, it's not. It's a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 and a special Xbox UI that makes it feel and behave more like a console. But it's not a console, and you shouldn't expect to pick one up and have a console experience with it.</p>



<p>You might have a console-like experience, heavy emphasis on 'like,' but it's a PC handheld, and even without having spent a lot of time with the full suite of PC handhelds out there, this definitely feels like one tailored for me, the console player who started seriously playing PC games within the last five years.</p>



<p>Having access to my full Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG library on the go in this form factor is awesome. It's not my full Xbox library, though, which is one reason it's only a 'console-like' experience. When I scroll over to the games that I 'Own' under my Xbox account, I don't see my full library.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Task switching in the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally with the new Xbox UI. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I'm not talking about not seeing games I have on physical discs; I'm talking about the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are playable on my Xbox Series X but don't appear here. Or any game that I know is available on my Xbox console but, for some reason, isn't on the Xbox PC app. It flat out is not my full Xbox library wherever I want it, and is only games playable through the Xbox PC app and Cloud Gaming.</p>

<p>It's honestly a small element in the grand scheme of it all. I know not everyone is going to be as miffed about this as I am, but it's another straw to add to my pile labeled, 'What am I paying $999 for then?' I also still really don't know who this device is for. If you're so invested in playing games that you'd be spending that kind of money on this device, you probably already have another means of getting your gaming time in. I get that portability is the big thing you're paying for here, but besides the fact that there are cheaper devices you can accomplish that with, your pre-existing PC and console can more than cover your gaming needs.</p>



<p>The price of this handheld is exorbitant; there's no other way to put it. In fairness, an overly expensive Xbox-branded PC handheld <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/">aligns perfectly with Microsoft's current Xbox plans</a>. Still, compared to other popular PC handhelds, including ASUS's own ROG Ally products, I'm not sure this is the upgrade to go for.</p>



<p>If you already own a PC gaming handheld, ROG Ally or not, this doesn't seem like enough of an upgrade to drop $999. If you're looking to grab your first PC gaming handheld, you absolutely do not need to jump to the top-end of the price chart to get what you want out of a device like this. Just pick up a case that has grips on either side to match its built-in grips.</p>



<p>Credit where it's due, this is still an impressive piece of technology. I definitely understand why devices like this have become popular, but I don't understand paying that much when you can get comparable experiences, particularly on ASUS's own devices, for less.</p>

				<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</p>

			<p>Last week, I spent an afternoon at the Steam Whistle Brewery in downtown Toronto. A short walk away from the CN Tower, Scotiabank Arena, and the Rogers Centre, I didn't cross the tourists in this bustling hub to play hooky for a beer or two at the downtown brewery. I was there on behalf of Wccftech to spend a little more hands-on time with the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, as well as hear from Whitson Gordon, ASUS's head of content for ROG and senior manager of marketing content, and Sascha Krohn, the global director of technical marketing at ASUS.</p>



<p>By this point, I had already spent a week with the ROG Xbox Ally X for my review of the device, (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which you can find here</a>), but having one at home meant that while I was at the event, I was more interested in seeing what Gordon and Krohn had to say about the device than getting to spend a little more hands-on time with it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The CN Tower in downtown Toronto, steps away from the Steam Whistle Brewery where ASUS Canada held the ROG Xbox Ally preview event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So after they both gave presentations, when I got the chance to sit down with them (or more accurately, stand outside with them while we all stood around a wooden barrel operating as a showtable for some of the laptops ASUS was showing off), I knew I had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">start by asking them about the price</a> of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>As a reminder, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, the lower-spec'd, cheaper version of the new ASUS and Xbox handheld, comes in at $599 USD (or $799 CAD), while the higher spec'd, top-end, more expensive Xbox Ally X costs a whopping $999 USD (or $1299 CAD). For context, you can take home the original ASUS ROG Ally for $499 USD, and the ASUS ROG Ally X for $799. So it's a $100 price increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, and a $200 increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally X to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had multiple ROG Xbox Ally devices and accessories for the handhelds on display at the event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are hardware differences between each device, with even the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally getting the next-generation AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor compared to the ASUS ROG Ally X's AMD Ryzen Z1, but these are absolutely not cheap devices. There's a lot you can buy for that kind of money, so I was curious as to how ASUS and Microsoft reached those prices, and if the fact that firms like Circana are reporting that 30% of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">US consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment</a> as the cost of essentials continues to rise is a concern for them when pricing devices like this.</p>



<p>But just before I got into any of that, I had to ask a much simpler question. What is this thing even called? And by that I meant, what do these marketing executives for ASUS call a product with a far too long, and far too confusing name?</p>



<p>"<em>I usually just call it the ROG Xbox Ally X</em>. <em>Or the Xbox Ally X. I try not to call it the Ally X, because then it gets confusing with the ROG Ally X,</em>" Gordon replied. It's a mouthful, I pointed out, and a confusing one at that. Krohn added that from his point of view internally, particularly when speaking with internal engineering teams, he addresses the two variants as the "<em>XA</em>" and the "<em>YA</em>," with the XA representing the ROG Xbox Ally X, and the YA representing the ROG Xbox Ally. He also mentioned that he will sometimes refer to them as their project codenames, which were Omni for the ROG Xbox Ally, and Horeseman for the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>

<figure><figcaption>ASUS even had the molds it made that helped shape the handheld's design during its conception phase.</figcaption></figure>

<p>For me, at least, this hastened my resolve that the devices' actual names are atrocious. Even Gordon's answer showed that they're very confusing when compared to ASUS's other products. Especially when you start getting into the weeds of what is and what isn't an Xbox, and the importance of Xbox software and services like Xbox Game Pass to the ROG Xbox Ally line. And speaking of Xbox Game Pass, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">recent price increase that saw players rush to cancel their subscriptions</a> led me right back to talking about the pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>"<em>I probably can't give you the detail that you want, because that starts getting into business contracts, and in general, we don't discuss those kinds of things</em>," Gordon began when answering how ASUS and Microsoft reached their pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. "<em>Geopolitics</em>," added Krohn. "<em>What I can say,</em>" Gordon continued, "<em>Is that,</em> <em>especially for the ROG Ally series of handhelds, trying to hit a good, affordable price has always been a big priority for us. We have had people ask us in the past, 'Oh, I want this big list of super premium features, can't you just release a $1500 handheld, I would pay for it.'"</em></p>



<p><em>"The reality is, if you're trying to really introduce a new form factor to the gaming world, if you want to really build that volume of people using the device, you've got to hit an affordable price point. And it's one of the reasons we have two SKUs now, is to make sure that we can cover as many of our bases as possible that and as many people can access this new era of handheld gaming</em>."</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The full ASUS ROG Ally and Xbox Ally line laid out, including the screen found in each display and the batteries.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was at this point that I brought up the aforementioned Circana report, because having two SKUs does at least give people options, but $599 USD still puts the ROG Xbox Ally in the premium range, especially since that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">right in between the cost of an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S console.</a> It's also more expensive than a base PS5 and slightly more expensive than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/">512GB model of the Steam Deck OLED</a>. The ROG Xbox Ally X, for its part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-official-amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-1049-usd-price-hands-on/">is $50 off from the Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, which is due out at the end of this month. Gaming has never been a cheap hobby, but it's arguably more expensive than ever, at a time when everything else seems more expensive than ever. So, where does the cost of living and what people have to pay for fit into pricing discussions?</p>



<p>"<em>That's absolutely always on our minds</em>," Gordon begins. "<em>We know that cost of living is a thing that's on everybody's minds, that's one of the reasons we want to try and hit as affordable a price point as we can. We just know that's an economic reality of the world</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Maybe don't necessarily look at it as a replacement for the devices that we have in the market</em>," Krohn adds. "<em>We already have the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X in the market right now, and I think this is a trend that you see in recent years with all sorts of devices: phones, laptops, and even graphics cards and CPUs. The new generation that comes out doesn't necessarily replace the previous one, but it adds to the product stack and sits on top of the product stack. That's the new stuff, and the previous generation stuff still sticks around for a little bit. So I think that's one way of looking at it, and I would say it's not necessarily replacing what's on the market right now, it's just adding something to it. And there's still a lot of value in the devices that are on the market right now.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also brought all the ROG Xbox Ally accessories to showcase.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>At least as long as those are still on shelves</em>," Gordon interjects. "<em>And that's true with all of our products, you see the same thing happen with laptops, the last generation is always around for people who want to get a good deal on that, until the new generation kind of supplants them, and that cycle continues.</em>"</p>



<p>It was clear to me that Gordon and Krohn wanted to send the message that if you're concerned about the pricing of these new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, the older generation is always there for you. But it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTAKSBvuT-A&amp;t=13s">wasn't exactly a Don Mattrick moment,</a> because it's not like some of the new features coming to the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are going to be exclusive to those devices. Namely, the software and UI upgrades that the Xbox Ally devices come with out of the box; those are coming to the ROG Ally and Ally X as updates on the Xbox Ally/Ally X launch day.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>This new Xbox UI is arriving on ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update when the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X launch. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>That's precisely why we had the discussion,</em> <em>and ultimately decided, both us and Xbox, to bring the full screen experience, not just to the latest handhelds, but also the existing ones</em>," Krohn said. "<em>So, like I said, it's more like we're viewing this as a complete lineup of ROG Ally handhelds, which starts with the original ROG Ally, and then the ROG Ally X on top, and then you have the ROG Xbox Ally X at the very top, and the ROG Xbox Ally, with the Z2 A, really great battery life and efficiency, somewhat on the side, like between the Ally X and the OG Ally, and we have those different price points, different performance tiers, battery life tiers, so we have four devices in total, and the current generation is absolutely still in play, and super interesting, especially from a price-to-performance perspective.</em>"</p>



<p>So that's the case for now and for the short-term future of these devices, since ASUS is not likely to release a ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X hardware refresh or upgrade within the next year. But what about beyond that? I asked Krohn and Gordon very directly if these new ROG Xbox Ally devices are now their own line of hardware running alongside the ROG Ally line, or if the ROG Xbox Ally is now overtaking the ROG Ally line.</p>



<p>"<em>No, this is the way forward for us. The ROG Xbox Ally is the direction that we're headed with this lineup of products</em>," Gordon said very definitively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Gordon's statement is definitive that the ROG Xbox Ally is the future of ASUS's ROG handheld line.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So if these devices are the way forward, and, as Gordon had mentioned several times in his presentation earlier that afternoon, this device is meant to provide a console-like experience and be a way into the PC gaming handheld space for console gamers, I wanted to hear more definitively about who Gordon and Krohn thought this device was for. (I touch on the question of who this handheld is really for more in my review, and why it was important for me to ask this question, which you can go check out now as a reminder.)</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's for PC gamers, Xbox gamers, anyone who wants to play these latest titles that are popular on current-generation platforms, and we're seeing all these platforms sort of start to merge together</em>,<em>" </em>Gordon began. "<em>Sony games coming to PC, Xbox games coming to PlayStation. Overall, the gaming ecosystem</em> <em>is really coming together in a way that we haven't seen in the past, and it's kind of freeing, right? Anyone who wants the best handheld experience on the go, to play all of these games, this is it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also set up two TVs connected to ROG Xbox Ally devices that were connected to ROG XG Mobile GPUs. But at this point, it feels worth pointing out that you might as well build a PC since these eGPUs can cost thousands.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>I would say it's a lot of things for a lot of different people</em>," Krohn added. "<em>It's two different devices that we are launching right now, and they're fairly different in their application, and what their strength is, what they're meant for, and what people find interesting about them, and I would say for anybody who is into PC gaming handhelds, what the ROG Xbox Ally X is: more performance, longer battery life, better erganomics, and much improved user interface." </em></p>



<p>"<em>For an Xbox console user, it is 'Wow, I can now take all my games with me, on the go, and I can even have access to game modding,' which is maybe something they're interested in. And they now have access to different catalogues of games, something like Spider-Man, maybe. So, I think to different people, it has a different appeal.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Would this actor be happier if he was looking at an OLED screen? Maybe. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One level of appeal that the ROG Xbox Ally devices lack is the inclusion of an OLED screen. And especially after hearing Krohn talk about the new Lumina Pro OLED screens from ASUS, I had to wonder if those screens would find their way inside a future ROG Xbox Ally device.</p>



<p>Gordon stepped up to answer this question, saying, "<em>We know that a lot of people are really interested in getting that kind of display experience on the Ally. There are a few reasons that we haven't done it yet. One of them is, like we talked about earlier, cost, trying to make sure that it stays affordable. Another is power usage."</em></p>



<p>"<em>So, one really interesting thing is, we don't want to give up Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and for a long time, that was something that was not as easily done on OLEDs and portable devices like this, and the current method for doing that on an OLED screen is more powerful, than what you're getting on this really great IPS display that we have on the Ally."</em></p>



<p>"<em>It looks excellent, and it's very power-efficient, and one of the most important things we have learned over the last two years of building the Ally is that battery life is one of the highest priorities. We don't want to give that up for an OLED screen that doesn't have an optimal solution for VRR. So, it's always on our radar, it's always something that we're testing, but it's just not quite where we want it to be yet for what we think is the best experience.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, it looks like we'll have to wait a little while longer to see a Lumina Pro OLED screen, or any OLED screen for that matter, in an ROG Xbox Ally handheld device. And probably pay at least $1K for it. For now, it seems like the ROG Xbox Ally line will keep Xbox in the hardware business, even if it is ASUS behind the wheel and Microsoft slapping an Xbox logo on top.</p>



<p>Thank you to Whitson Gordon and Sascha Krohn for speaking with me and for being so generous with their time and answers. </p>
