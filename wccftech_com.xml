			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled)</a>, Ubisoft cancelled an Assassin's Creed game in 2024 that would have been set in the 19th century, specifically in a post-American Civil War era setting. Players would have taken on the role of a Black man who had been enslaved in the American South before the war, now living in the western regions of the country, looking to start a new life.</p>



<p>That is, until you would have been recruited by the Order of Assassins and sent back to the American South to face a growing Templar threat, which would have, according to Totilo's report, seen your character "<em>confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo's report comes from a mix of five current and former Ubisoft employees who all spoke under anonymity, who claim that the game was cancelled for two main reasons.</p>



<p>The first was Ubisoft deciding it didn't want to go through the same online turmoil it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">over the inclusion of Yasuke</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows. The second reason was that Ubisoft management ultimately seemed to believe that releasing an Assassin's Creed game with this setting would have been like stepping on the third rail in the United States with regards to the game's political setting.</p>



<p>"<em>Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short</em>," a source reportedly told Game File.</p>



<p>This wouldn't have been the first time Ubisoft has broached atrocities like slavery in its historical settings. Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry was a spin-off to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where you play as Adéwalé, a Black man from Trinidad who was a slave before his time on Edward Kenway's ship in the Black Flag campaign. Beyond your regular Assassin's Creed stealth and action gameplay, a core element of the story was freeing other Black people who had been enslaved by the Templars.</p>



<p>In fact, you could argue that making the kind of game described by the report here would be the next logical step if you wanted to continue exploring the idea of a character fighting back against those who enslaved him and those like him.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that for all the 'backlash' Ubisoft received online for having Yasuke as one of two protagonists, Assassin's Creed Shadows had a stellar launch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-shadows/">from a critical</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/"> commercial perspective</a>, and even now <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">is still one of the best-selling games of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Ubisoft would have been able to execute on this story is another matter, but the fact that Ubisoft management allegedly deemed a story that would have, among other things, pointed out the very obvious fact that slavery is an awful, terrible, and disgusting stain on human history, "<em>too political</em>," is telling in its own way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, the gaming industry was rocked by two big announcements: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive 50% Xbox Game Pass price hike</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveraged buyout of EA for $55 billion from a Consortium of investors</a>. With both likely to influence the industry in their own ways, we have contacted MIDiA Research Games Analyst Brandon Sutton to get his opinion on what will happen to Electronic Arts and the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><strong><em>Brandon, what's your take on both news?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debt burden is notable</a>, Saudi Arabia and its partners purchasing EA makes sense on several levels. Financially, EA owns some of the most profitable gaming franchises with proven monetization models. Culturally, its partnerships with leading sports and entertainment brands give it a rare connection with global audiences that its new owners can leverage. Technologically, video game development offers a powerful testing ground for emerging tools like generative AI. This creates a natural compatibility for investors who are already invested in that space as well.</em></p>



<p><em>The increase in Xbox Game Pass prices are part of a wider pattern of rising costs across the industry. Inflation and rising costs of operation are certainly factors, but so is the growing consolidation of the market. This has emboldened major industry players to increase prices. The risk, however, is that consumers will still see gaming as a luxury and steep increases from larger companies could ultimately push them toward cheaper, indie alternatives</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think EA will soon implement layoffs or even studio divestitures to reduce costs, and if so, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is BioWare the main candidate</a>?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Prior to the acquisition news, EA was already enacting layoffs, with Respawn being hit especially hard earlier this year, so the acquisition could slow some of that down. However, new ownership will likely be taking stock of where workers and teams can be cut, perhaps replaced with generative AI, in order to trim costs once the deal is finalized. Post-acquisition, it wouldn't be surprising to see studio divestitures or the sale of IP to recoup costs. BioWare is certainly a strong candidate, given the recent underperformance of Dragon Age: Veilguard.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Is there a risk that Microsoft will alienate some of its oldest Xbox fans with such a steep increase in Game Pass pricing and the fact that they have walked back on some promises? For instance, they have now removed Call of Duty from the Premium tier, so only the Ultimate tier will get access to the popular game.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I think the move will alienate many longtime Xbox fans. However, Microsoft is likely calculating that an increase in negative sentiment will not translate into a meaningful amount of canceled subscriptions. That said, consumers are feeling a financial crunch right now and so rising prices combined with a sense of broken trust will likely have lasting consequences for the wider Xbox brand and Microsoft ecosystem even if Game Pass subscription revenue remains strong.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></em></p>
