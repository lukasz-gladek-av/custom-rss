			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-010-00-00-full-patch-notes-revealed/"> major update</a> introduced a lot of new features to the game, as well as new content in the form of a new monster to hunt, the returning monster Mizutsune and the highly-anticipated high rank Zoh Shia hunt, which is one of the most challenging fights in the game to date. As per series tradition, a hard hunt is rewarded with monster parts that can be used to craft powerful gear.</p>
<p>After you have defeated high rank Zoh Shia in the Germination quest, you will likely want to fight the powerful monster again to get more of its parts to craft its excellent gear. The easiest way to fight the high rank variant of the campaign's final boss is to take advantage of the SOS Flare mechanics. Any time while not in a hunt, speak with Alma, select the <strong>SOS Flare Quests</strong> tab in the Quests menu, and select Zoh Shia as the target. Chances are you will find plenty of quests with some openings, although it may take some time to join a quest as these tend to fill up rather quickly.</p>

<p>The second option to fight against high rank Zoh Shia again after taking it down the first time in Monster Hunter Wilds is by unlocking <strong>Zoh Shia Investigations</strong> in your game world, and doing so is simple enough, if you know where to look. The powerful monster can only appear in the <strong>Ruins of Wyveria</strong> during the season of <strong>Inclemency</strong>. As such, getting a Zoh Shia Investigation requires you to head over to the Ruins of Wyveria, enter your tent, change the Season to Inclemency, rinse and repeat until Zoh Shia appears, of which you will be notified in-game the same way you are notified about the appearance of other apex predators like Jin Dahaad and Rey Dau. At this point, you can already save the newly available hunting quest as an Investigation, which you can replay three times. If these three times are not enough to get all the parts you need, you will simply have to repeat the process above to make Zoh Shia appear again.</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing plenty of new features and improvements, including PSSR support on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The introduction of support for the AI-powered upscaler that made its debut with the mid-generation refresh system last year is accompanied by the introduction of Raytraced Specular in Balanced Mode, bringing this display mode's visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro Quality Mode than Performance Mode. Those playing the game for the first time on PlayStation 5 Pro with the 1.0.2 patch will have PSSR enabled by default, but everyone else will have to enable it in the video tab of the pause menu.</p>
<p>After the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch went live, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> released a comparison video that highlights how PSSR adds some improvements to image quality with better antialiasing. However, its implementation still isn't perfect, as there's a loss in sharpening and reflections, which has been seen in other games as well.</p>

<p>The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch, as mentioned above, also introduces other changes and improvements, such as horse auto-follow and speed improvements, the ability to reset Master Nodes straight from the menu, selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to toggle between dynamic resolution scaling and fixed resolution mode regardless of upscaler quality on PC and more. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">here.</a></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 unveiling may have been largely positive, but there are a few things that didn't sit very well with some fans, such as the pricing of the hardware and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the software</a>. It doesn't help that the console pre-orders, scheduled to go live later today in most of the world, have been delayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> due to the US tariffs issue, making North American customers even more anxious about a further price increase.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has shared a tone-deaf statement that has riled up fans even more. As <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by CBC Canada, he essentially told them to go buy the original Switch if they can't afford the new one.</p>
<p><em>As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about ... we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall. We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.</em></p>
<p>Those with a long enough memory have instantly remembered Don Mattrick's similar statement. When the Xbox One was facing criticism because of the console's initial mandatory online connectivity, he famously said:</p>
<p><em>We have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360.</em></p>
<p>The terrible Xbox One marketing essentially doomed Microsoft's third console from the get-go in its fight against Sony's PlayStation 4. The Nintendo Switch 2 likely won't suffer the same fate, with analysts believing it will still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become the fastest-selling console ever</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn into more of a primary platform for core gamers</a>. Still, this reveal could have gone a bit more smoothly.</p>
