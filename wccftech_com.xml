			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios announced that the first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream will air tomorrow at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET <a href="http://twitch.tv/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> from Kuttenberg, one of the two main cities featured in the game. During the stream, the developers will hold a special live Q&amp;A session, during which they will reveal more information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio has announced a four-part live-action video series starring Tom McKay and Luke Dale, who play Henry of Skalitz (the main character) and his noble friend Hans Capon. The debut episode set in Kutná Hora will go live on Thursday, November 7, at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET on the developer's <a href="http://youtube.com/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now set to launch on February 11, 2025. When the game was first unveiled earlier this year, the goal was to release it before the end of 2024. However, a short delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. That's where we had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima, who was all too happy to dive into the game's features for our readers.</p>
<p>By the way, Warhorse also announced today a major milestone for the first installment. It was only this February that Kingdom Come Deliverance <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-passes-6-million-sales-on-its-6th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> six million units sold on its sixth anniversary; nine months later, it has surpassed 8 million units. It's likely due to major discounts ahead of the sequel, but it's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the developers published a blog post <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/4514388158400430393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> where Senior Game Designer Ondřej Bittner talked about the inner workings of survival in the game.</p>
<p><em>The game has survival elements to it because you have to eat and you have to sleep. But that’s for the immersion. It's not hard to be rested and well fed and so on. The food spoils over time, so if you’re going somewhere far away it’s good to have dried fruit or dried meat jerky because it lasts longer. You can be vulnerable when you’re asleep. You can be robbed, or you can be attacked, depending on the circumstances. We even have it in the executioner’s historical records that someone might rob a house, get drunk, and then pass out on the bed - the perfect crime…</em></p>
<p><em>But generally, if you’re found somewhere you’re not supposed to be, you’ll be woken up. Or if someone’s looking for you because you did something wrong and they find you asleep, they’ll wake you up. You’ll need to pay your fine, or you’ll be arrested, whipped, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Overall, the design philosophy is said to differ from the average game. Rather than asking players to focus on tasks, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will encourage players to pay attention to their surroundings.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws Gets New Creative Director, Biggest Update To Come 21 November]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>
