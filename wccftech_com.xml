			<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/565124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new GeForce driver (Game Ready version 576.40) for DOOM: The Dark Ages. The game is coming out on Thursday, May 15, but early access begins tomorrow for those who purchased the Premium Edition. This is also the edition that comes with the GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The game supports various NVIDIA GeForce RTX technologies, such as DLSS Super Resolution (on RTX 20 and upward GPUs), DLSS Frame Generation (on RTX 40 and upward GPUs), and DLSS Multi Frame Generation (on RTX 50 GPUs). NVIDIA says that owners of the latest graphics cards can expect up to 4x faster frame rates when enabling all these technologies at once. DOOM: The Dark Ages, powered by id Tech 8, also already supports ray tracing. However, with a post-launch update, its visuals will be further improved with full-fledged path tracing.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages received an 8.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>

			<p>Some interesting Assassin's Creed Shadows behind-the-scenes data revealed during this year's Game Developer Conference reveals why more and more developers are leaving baked lighting behind in favor of ray tracing.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1035526/Rendering-Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rendering Assassin's Creed Shadows presentation</a> presented by Ubisoft's Nicolas Lopez, as reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-gdc-talk-on-ray-tracing-console-performance-developer-pains-and-more.1186575/">ResetERA forums</a>, a background for global illumination usage in the series was provided, highlighting how the more complex the game world got, the more compromises had to be made. Assassin's Creed Unity features one of the most stunning examples of baked global illumination to date, which was made possible by the relatively small world and fixed time of day. If Assassin's Creed Origins had used the same method as Unity, the game would have had 450 GB of lighting data, and it would have taken 3 months to bake the lighting. Featuring the most complex game world of the series to date, Assassin's Creed Shadows would have had 2 TB of lighting data, and it would have taken almost 2 years to bake the lighting instead. As such, with ray tracing simplifying the development pipeline considerably, developers will likely move further away from baked lighting even more in the future. The Assassin's Creed Shadows developer supported both baked global illumination and ray-traced global illumination for the time being because of the hardware landscape, but they want to rely more on ray tracing in the future.</p>
<p>During the presentation, which is a fascinating read for all those interested in game development, data regarding Assassin's Creed Shadows ray tracing performance on consoles and PC using an RTX 4080 GPU for ray-traced global illumination and PlayStation 5 Pro performance for ray-traced reflections. With the game using quarter resolution for RTGI, the Xbox Series X is faster than the base PlayStation 5, 4.30ms versus 5.00ms. The Xbox Series S is even faster, but that is due to the game running on the system at the internal resolution of 900p, as opposed to the 1440p resolution of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions. Regarding ray-traced reflections, the PlayStation 5 Pro couldn't be compared to any other console version of the game, as it's the only console supporting them, and the only available comparison with the RTX 4080 GPU delivers the expected difference in performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5-6-seasons-says-lead-cast-member/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Fallout TV show could run for a total of five or six seasons, according to lead cast member Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus, a Brotherhood of Steel squire who befriends protagonist Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell). Moten spoke at a <span>Comic-Con Liverpool&nbsp;panel, as Comic Basics <a href="https://www.comicbasics.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-six-seasons-says-aaron-moten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>:</span></p>
<p><em>When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point. That endpoint hasn’t changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We’ve always known that we’re going to take our time with the development of the characters.</em></p>
<p>The showrunners themselves had <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> something similar following the incredible success of the debut season around a year ago. Showrunner Graham Wagner said at the time:</p>
<p><em>We’ve talked about a billion seasons as a jokey way to evade the question because we don’t control that. So our hope is to end every season with a semi-satisfying, semi-open-ended kind of shape. Look, we’ve talked about three seasons and we’ve talked about five seasons. Given the success of the show, five is suddenly feeling a little more appealing. But the industry is a temperamental thing and we kind of have to go into each season being like, “This is our last.”</em></p>
<p>The second season of the Fallout TV show wrapped up filming last week, as <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/1920533288629792880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1920533288629792880%7Ctwgr%5E9ef78854d7d58c9f618b88f3df81bfb84d0a0110%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeebom.com%2Ffallout-season-2-production-wraps%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on the official X channel. There's no official word yet on when it will be released on Amazon Prime Video, but it could be either late this year or early next year. Regardless, fellow lead actor Walton Goggins already hyped it as even better than the first one in an interview with Deadline earlier this year:</p>
<p><em>This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story. It’s really gonna be something. I can’t wait for people to see it. We’re working really hard to make that happen.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was one of the bright spots in 2020, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> on the horizon in July, fans are hoping this isn't the last remastered Tony Hawk game we'll see. Even Tony Hawk himself doesn't want this to be the end, and would like to see Activision move on to the Tony Hawk's Underground games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">ScreenRant</a>, Hawk was asked about whether the Underground games had entered his conversations with Activision. He admitted that they hadn't necessarily talked about the Underground games, but Hawk did make it clear that he would like to see it happen, and that he'll be doing his best to make it happen.</p>
<p>"<em>I always have aspirations</em>," Hawk said. "<em>It's not up to me, generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me.</em>"</p>
<p>It seems that if it were up to Tony Hawk to make the call as to what the next remastered games would be, he'd have Activision work their way through the rest of the series, with Underground 1+2 next. But the chances of that will depend on how Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 goes.</p>
<p>And even then, it still might not happen. Even the fact that 3+4 is happening at all feels like something related to a miracle, since Activision had <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">originally said no to a pitch from Vicarious Visions for 3+4</a>, before Vicarious Visions was sunsetted and absorbed into Blizzard.</p>
<p>If THPS 3+4 is able to repeat and improve on the success that THPS 1+2, then we can remain hopeful that an Underground 1+2 remaster will be on the way. Until then, we can look forward to the fan remake that's underway, with the first Underground game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-tony-hawks-underground-remake/">remade in Unreal Engine 5.</a></p>

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>AceZone A-Blaze</h5><p><span>May 12th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone is far from being a widely recognizable brand, but there's no doubt that the Danish company deserves to be as popular as other headset manufacturers, as its products geared towards eSports are of the highest quality, and are absolutely worthy of their prices. The high prices of products such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-spire-wireless-for-the-most-demanding/">A-Spire Wireless</a> which I had the chance to try out earlier this year is effectively the only reason why it has failed to reached a wider audience, as some of its advanced features, such as its excellent Active Noise Cancelling tech, are great to have even in everyday usage like playing single player games that may not require the incredible audio accuracy the headset offers and even in not-intended use cases, like playing guitar or drums very loudly.</p>
<p>AceZone has been well aware of how the high price of their headsets prevented them from becoming more popular among players aiming to become the top of the pack in eSports games. As such, the Danish company has created the A-Blaze, a headset coming with a good portion of the features that make their other headsets excellent, but at a more palatable price. Even with some different features, is the A-Blaze a worthy addition to the AceZone headset lineup? It most definitely is, as only the most demanding players will miss the features removed from the A-Spire to make the new headset more affordable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the AceZone A-Blaze retailing for $199 when it will launch in the United States, €199 in Europe, where it can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.acezone.io/en-eu/products/a-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOorw9lp0mg5AhtVWNwd2IypEMNtpx_zYmEIikXJ3383Z_g4DWBkt">official website</a>, instead of the $369/€369 of the A-Spire Wireless, it's not surprising to see that the headset doesn't come with a hard carry case, but, at a glance, that seems the only significant difference with its more expensive counterpart. The A-Blaze sports the same design as the A-Spire, with an all black color scheme in place of the black and grey, which still looks great, and gives the headset a very professional look that is far removed from that of other gaming headsets that often sport vibrant designs and RGB lights. Packed together with the headset is a wireless dongle and a USB-C cable, allowing users to use the headset wirelessly and wired with ease. In both cases, the headset is instantly recognized on Windows 11, making for a proper, hassle-free plug and play experience that is very welcome, with extremely low audio latency, which is not surprising, as the A-Blaze, much like the A-Spire Wireless, features Bluetooth 5.4 powered by the newest chipset from Qualcomm. In terms of connectivity, however, the A-Blaze doesn't offer a traditional AUX connection, which could be an issue for console players who want to plug the headset into their controllers. Other than this very minor issue, using the headset on PlayStation 5 is just as simple as doing the same on PC, as it paired without any hassle with my launch model. With the same weight of 270 grams, the A-Blaze is as comfortable as the A-Spire. The built-in DSP also allows users to store their personalized settings in the headset itself, so the installation of software or using the mobile app is not required.</p>
<p>Besides a different color scheme and the lack of a traditional AUX connection, the other features removed from the A-Spire to make the AceZone A-Blaze more affordable are unlikely to be an issue for most users. The new headset has a less powerful Hybrid ANC and Noise Cancelling Microphone, which, to be honest, I wouldn't have realized if I didn't put the headset through some extreme tests. Like for the A-Spire headset, I used the A-Blaze while playing acoustic drums, and I had no trouble hearing the click and the backing track even when going all out during some intense progressive metal tunes. Same for the microphone, whose quality is just as good as that of the A-Spire microphone, even though it probably wouldn't be able to accomplish the same extreme noise cancelling as its more expensive counterpart is capable of. The A-Blaze's functionality via the mobile app is significantly reduced, as it doesn't support glasses mode, microphone equalizer, and adjustable ANC and transparency, which are features that only the most advanced audio-savvy users would be using for particular use cases. With a 45-hour battery life, compared to the 35 hours of the A-Spire, the A-Blaze at least comes up on top in this regard, and can be used for longer on a full charge, which is definitely good to have.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though it features less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC, the AceZone A-Blaze still features the same top-notch audio quality as the A-Spire. While AceZone developed their audio technology with eSport titles in mind, with a specific audio design, allowing users to hear sounds that are almost imperceptible on other headsets with incredible accuracy, it works incredibly well with pretty much every game, especially in those experiences meant to be immersive. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, for example, I was able to hear sounds that were completely lost in the audio mix using some standard earbuds and headphones, making the experience more immersive than ever. In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the A-Blaze allowed me to listen to the game's fantastic soundtrack in the best possible way and hear some very soft guitar and keyboard passages that would have been lost otherwise. If you have even a remote interest in audio quality, there's really no better choice in gaming than the AceZone's headsets.</p>
<p>While the price point of $199/€199 may still be beyond the budget most gamers are willing to invest into a gaming headset, the A-Blaze is more than worthy purchase for all those who want to elevate their gaming experiences, no matter the type of game they usually play. As the features that have been removed from the more expensive A-Spire Wireless were geared towards the most demanding e-Sports games players, their removal shouldn't impact the target audience for the A-Blaze, ultimately making it a much more enticing purchase.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Featuring the same incredible audio quality and only slightly less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC as the A-Spire - but at a considerably lower price - the AceZone A-Blaze is undoubtedly an excellent headset, more than worthy of its cost for those seeking the best product in its price range. Despite cutting a few features found in its more expensive counterpart—features unlikely to affect the vast majority of regular users—the headset retains a premium feel that sets it apart from nearly every other gaming headset, ditching unnecessary frills like RGB lighting in favor of features that truly matter and elevate the gaming experience.</p>
