			<p>A new Dragon Ball video game project will be announced in late January 2026 during a special celebration of the franchise's 40th anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/DB_anime_info">As confirmed on X by the official series anime profile</a>, the new game project will be announced during the Dragon Ball Genkidamasturi event on January 25, 2026. The event, which will be held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan will also feature other announcements, discussion panels and events hosted by Masako Nozawa (Goku voice actress), Akio Iyoku (executive producer) and Hironobu Kageyama, the composer of some of the series' most iconic opening tracks like Cha-La-Head-Cha-la and We Gotta Power, the opening themes for the classic DBZ anime.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed any other details on this new game project, so even speculation is difficult at this time. The fighting games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-super-saiyan-god/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</a> are still receiving updates and new content, as is the role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-authentic-ambitious-adequate/">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and multiple free-to-play games like Dokkan Battle, Legends and Gekishin Squadra.</p>



<p>As hyping up a new game announcement so far ahead of time wouldn't make sense for a minor project possibly belonging to video game genres that are still actively represented by other titles, there's a solid chance this new announcement could be something unique and unexpected. Hopefully, it will be an adequate game to celebrate the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-dies-68-gaming-legacy/">passed away last year.</a></p>
