			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dying-light-the-beast-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-tracing-nvidia-reflex/">confirmed</a> the games getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, DLSS Super Resolution, NVIDIA Reflex and Ray Tracing tech, with Dying Light: The Beast and Gears of War: Reloaded headlining today's additions.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches today, after Techland moved the release date up from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">September 19 launch to today, September 18,</a> and its arriving with full support for a suite of NVIDIA technologies. On top of the aforementioned DLSS 4 Multi-Frame gen, it's also arriving with support for NVIDIA Reflex, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA. NVIDIA claims that players on RTX 50 Series graphics cards can enjoy frame rates multiplied by 7.6X on average with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution enabled while playing the game at 4K.</p>



<p>While 1440p players can enjoy a 5X performance boost if they've got an RTX 5090 in their desktop, making it possible to run the game at "<em>over 400 frames per second</em>." If you don't have a 5090 but you do have an RTX 50 Series card, you can still get the game running at 200+ frames per second, according to NVIDIA, with max settings and ray-tracing enabled.</p>



<p>Dying Light isn't the only game getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, as Mistfall Hunter enters into its closed beta with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support. It's also joined by Farming Simulator 25, which players can update today to see DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support go live.</p>



<p>Lastly, Jump Space, a new PvE co-op action game launching into early access tomorrow on September 19 will arrive with support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution, and Gears of War: Reloaded is getting an update today to support DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. </p>



<p>The last big batch of games that got support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 and DLSS Super Resolution included the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">Order of Giants DLC from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
