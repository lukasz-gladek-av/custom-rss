			<p>A couple of days ago, Epic Games <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/58476593/Epic_Games,_Inc_v_Atas_aka_Sincey_Cheats_and_Vanta_Cheats_et_al" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina against Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey Cheats and Vanta Cheats, a maker of Fortnite cheats.</p>
<p>Epic Games alleges that Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey and Vanta Cheats, has made money from developing and selling cheat software for Fortnite since at least January 2023. According to the firm, the software gives players an unfair advantage over those who don't cheat and is therefore in violation of its EULA due to its circumvention of Fortnite's anti-cheat software. Epic also claims widespread cheating could put legitimate players off, potentially translating into a loss of sales of season passes and cosmetics. In its lawsuit, Epic said it was forced to ban tens of thousands of Fortnite accounts using Sincey Cheats software, including over 15K bans against accounts in the United States alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that, after Epic Games submitted DMCA takedown notices to YouTube to remove videos featuring the offending cheating software, Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent, impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to “formally reverse its claim of copyright infringement” by spoofing Epic Games email addresses. You can see an example <a href="https://x.com/SinceyCheats/status/1872973112892928458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targets five unnamed defendants who have been reselling Sincey Cheats's software through various channels. Predictably, Epic Games is seeking compensatory and statutory damages, as well as covering attorney costs and other lawsuit-related costs.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a game developer has sued a cheat maker. Bungie did it a few times recently against Destiny 2 cheat makers and even won against both <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-cheat-seller-lavicheats-is-hit-by-6-7m-lawsuit-from-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaviCheats</a> (getting a multi-million dollar compensation) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AimJunkies</a>. Whether that will be enough to discourage cheat makers remains to be seen.</p>
