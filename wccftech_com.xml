			<p>The delay of Subnautica 2 has sparked into somewhat of a controversy between developer Unknown Worlds and parent company KRAFTON. Let's take a minute to recap what happened, chronologically:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally meant to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by June 2025</a>, but that clearly didn't happen</li>



<li>Earlier this month, KRAFTON <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced</a> the Unknown Worlds studio leadership (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) with industry veteran Steve Papoutsis</li>



<li>This week, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that KRAFTON had delayed Subnautica 2 to 2026. They also added that this would cause Unknown Worlds to lose a $250 million bonus linked to reaching a certain amount of revenue by the end of the year.</li>



<li>The delay was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>. However, KRAFTON claimed that it was not at all influenced by financial or contractual considerations.</li>



<li>Shortly afterward, the Korean publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked</a> the former leadership directly, stating that they had abandoned their responsibilities and caused the game to slip. For example, they said Charlie Cleveland focused on a personal film project of his instead of working on the game. </li>



<li>The studio leads would have allegedly received 90% of that $250 million bonus.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, some Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an internal KRAFTON document that shows exactly why the publisher didn't want the game to launch. In the current state, Subnautica 2 lacked the 'level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.' The document also adds that content was removed from the original plan for the early access launch, such as two biomes, one type of Leviathan, certain creatures, several tools, about six hours of narrative content, and even the character customization feature. </p>

<p>Basically, KRAFTON highlighted that the current version of Subnautica 2 wouldn't make users happy, thus the need for the delay to add more content and polish before making the game available to the public.</p>



<p>The former Unknown Worlds executives aren't taking those accusations lying down, though. A few hours ago, Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Reddit community</a> that he and the other execs are filing a lawsuit against KRAFTON:</p>



<p><em>We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>



<p>Cleveland also denied that the $250 million bonus would have gone almost entirely to them. He said that they had always shared profits with the team and this would not have been different. </p>



<p>Needless to say, KRAFTON is likely to respond in kind to the lawsuit. We'll keep you apprised of any further updates.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy producer, director, and designer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Anime News Network</a> at last week's Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, California. One of the first questions was about the viability of turn-based combat for future installments in the series. It was Yoshida himself who infamously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that, as the visuals get more realistic, it is increasingly challenging for some gamers to stomach turn-based combat without feeling a dissonance. That's one of the reasons Final Fantasy XVI went with action combat only, angering some fans in the process.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which does feature turn-based combat (albeit spiced up with real time elements), did Yoshida change his mind? Not quite, based on his answer, though he did not exclude the possibility that the next Final Fantasy might have turn-based combat.</p>



<p><em>With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system. That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based. I'm not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida was chosen as the producer of Final Fantasy XVI after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-naoki-yoshida-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his excellent work as director of Final Fantasy XIV</a>. What did he learn during the development of the single player game?</p>



<p><em>There's a lot, but if I were to pick one, we were able to learn how to produce a high-end video game. There were a lot of learning points through that, and I feel like we gleaned a lot of know-how through the process. I want to challenge myself or apply to future works on how we can swiftly produce something of high quality and minimize the development period without lowering the quality.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida then said that he and his Final Fantasy XIV already have plans up to version 10.0 (the game is currently at version 7.0 with the Dawntrail expansion). Lastly, he expressed the desire to make a new online game based on a brand-new intellectual property at some point, and he added he doesn't feel anywhere near his retirement (he's currently 52).</p>
