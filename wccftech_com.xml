			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 system software update, released yesterday, introduced a rather major fix alongside the minor enhancements documented in the official update note.</p>
<p>As initially reported on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1l3ane7/it_seems_like_todays_ps5_software_update_fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, and later confirmed by Sony itself to Digital Foundry, the latest system software update fixed a known VRR issue that caused stuttering in games running at 120 Hz with unlocked framerate like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Diablo 4. The stuttering issues would present themselves even in games that do not have 120 Hz modes but take advantage of the system-level feature that works in the 48Hz to 60Hz range, and even in this case, the issues have been reportedly fixed, as Elden Ring no longer starts stuttering after 20 minutes of play like it did before. It's definitely surprising not to see this rather major PlayStation 5 issue getting fixed highlighted in the patch notes, but still, it's very good that Sony finally addressed this issue to offer on its current-generation systems the same smooth VRR experience that has been provided by the Xbox Series systems.</p>

<p lang="en">Sony PR contacted me yesterday to confirm that - as already detected by some - the latest PlayStation firmware resolves the VRR hiccup issue. When I find a spare moment, I'll test it out.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-04-11-40-00/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> did not introduce any major new features to the console, introducing only improvements for messages and usability on some screens. The latest update, which introduced some new features, was released back in April. It reintroduced the PlayStation 30th Anniversary UI and the Audio Focus feature, which allows players to better hear quiet sounds and voice chat in games.</p>

			<p>One of the most interesting surprise announcements from <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play</a> is Sea of Remnants. Developed by Joker Studio, primarily known for the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Identity V, and published by NetEase Games, the game is described as a free-to-play ocean adventure roleplaying game scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Sylar Pan, Product Lead at Joker Studio, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Sea of Remnants places the world’s fate directly in the players’ hands. With more than 300 characters to interact with—whether as allies, enemies, or something in between—every action can trigger surprising and far-reaching consequences. We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Remnants | Anchors Aweigh, Capt'n -  Gameplay Trailer | Get ready for PlayStation!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02YOz0N51ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The premise of Sea of Remnants is quite peculiar. Players will take the role of puppet-looking sailors who have lost all their memories and embark on a journey alongside a mysterious girl across vast seas and uncharted islands to a city slowly awakening to its secrets.</p>
<p>During their travels, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and assemble specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision, whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities, will have dramatic consequences for the world. As rival factions react to each choice and the cityscape of Orbtopia evolves in response, no two captains will experience the same journey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while land combat is turn-based, naval fights take place in real time, with positioning and timing playing a crucial role in the outcome. As mentioned by the developer in the above statement, there will be over 300 non-player characters to interact with, each featuring distinct designs and personalities as well as their own allegiances. Players can befriend, provoke, or remove them. When in Orbtopia, players will even find leisure activities such as mahjong, and life skills such as hotspot cooking and fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> of Sea of Remnants already includes the minimum and recommended requirements.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play livestream</a>, KONAMI aired a new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater gameplay trailer. The footage shows off Snake's various stealth and disguise options before moving to more direct fight scenes against a few of the game's bosses. Before the end, the developers also offered a glimpse at the returning Snake vs Monkey minigame, which will be available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Following years of rumors telling of a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, KONAMI finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater in May 2023. This new version is being made with the help of Virtuos, which has also worked with Bethesda on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</a></p>
<p>Last year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hasnt-been-messed-with-says-konami-console-graphics-modes-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the narrative would remain exactly the same as in the original. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the control scheme had to be updated to modern standards.</p>
<p>Players can opt for the newly added, more modern control style. These intuitive controls allow them to focus entirely on the game. Alternatively, it is also possible to stick with the classic control style for those who desire the full-blown nostalgia effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKMayCD1u3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology, which brings a massive visual improvement over the original game. The developers said that characters are rendered with such detail that you can see facial wrinkles and pores, as well as separate eye and iris movements, allowing for rich and expressive facial animations.</p>
<p>You can also find the PC system requirements below, courtesy of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. The game is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 28</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
