			<p>Any title in the Xbox portfolio of games can be considered for a port on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, as Phil Spencer doesn't see a red line in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTQ5OTU0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMTA0MzQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVcxQ01UMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.UjaVdB-1hJKO1VKY0-vUQaOjf2cpmUgGaLSXNqqYnHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Xbox commented on a variety of topics, including porting Xbox titles to other formats. Phil Spencer is pleased with the results of the first batch of games released on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch so far, and more will be coming in the future. In regard to which titles will make the jump in the future, the head of Xbox said that he sees no sort of red lines in their portfolio that say "thou must not," but it's definitely too early to make any sort of decision on the next entry in the Halo series. As such, it really sounds like nothing is off the table, although a day-and-date release on Xbox and other consoles at the same time doesn't sound very likely.</p>
<p>Phil Spencer also touched upon the handheld market, which has been thriving in the past few years. The head of Xbox said that the "expectation" is that the company is going to do something in this regard. At this stage, they are working on prototypes and considering the future, and Phil Spencer asked his team to look at the market and develop their device based on what is learned. This device, Spencer added, is a few years out, so we won't be seeing it anytime soon.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Xbox head Phil Spencer has talked about the rumored handheld, but it is the first time he commented on the matter in a more concrete way. As the device is still a few years away, however, there's no telling what it will be capable of doing and if it will be focused on local play, as Spencer himself hinted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/">earlier this year.</a></p>

					<p>Sony’s Horizon franchise has always felt like it had the potential to tap into a younger demographic, what with its plucky youthful protagonist, largely bloodless robot dino combat, and environmental messaging, but Sony never really pitched the games that hard toward kids – until now. This week sees the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which reassembles 2017’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> into a plastic-y kid-friendly form.</p>
<p>Will Lego Horizon Adventures attract a whole new audience to Aloy’s exploits? Or does Sony’s arrow fall short of the intended target? Time to break this blocky adventure down.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures sticks to the broad strokes laid down by Horizon Zero Dawn, in the sense that you play as a redhead named Aloy with a mysterious past who has to save a world overrun by aggressive robo dinos and fanatical cultists. Beyond that, most of the original game’s complex backstory involving competing AIs, cloning, and other sci-fi chicanery has been jettisoned, presumable to keep this game approachable for younger players. Hearing Ashly Burch and other original HZD cast members (<a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddicks-untimely-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minus Lance Reddick, sadly</a>) doing poppy kid-friendly versions of their characters is interesting, and the plot being boiled all the way down to “you have to stop Helis because he hates trees” is amusing in a way, but <em>so</em> much has been sanded down in this retelling that the story becomes rather uninteresting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While this version of Horizon Zero Dawn’s story isn’t that compelling, the franchise’s world still looks very impressive done up with Lego. The makers of Lego Horizon Adventures went with a fixed isometric camera, which allows them to pack every inch of the screen with a huge amount of detail and plenty of flashy effects, including ray tracing. The game offers the choice of a 30fps Fidelity mode and 60fps Performance mode on PS5, with both running very consistently, even with tons of stuff flying around on screen.</p>
<p>That said, while the isometric approach allows for lavish visuals, it doesn’t necessarily serve the core gameplay that well. True to the original Horizon games, Aloy largely fights with a bow in Lego Horizon Adventures, but ranged combat has never got along with isometric camera angles very well. This is particularly true in this game, where you’re constantly having to aim at machines’ glowing weak spots. There are varying levels of aim assistance you can turn on, but playing as Aloy and most of her friends never feels as precise or enjoyable as it should.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures5-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I say <em>most</em> of her friends, as playable characters Aloy, Varl, and Teersa all use ranged attacks, but Erend, who isn't unlocked until nearly halfway through the game, wields a big ol’ melee hammer. Playing as Erend feels more impactful and gratifying than any other character, but even he’s not perfect, as it's pretty clear Lego Horizon Adventures was largely designed around ranged combat, with almost every enemy scooting around quickly and spamming long-range attacks. I still preferred taking control of Erend, but there's no ideal, fully satisfying character to play as.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures’ core gameplay not quite stacking up is frustrating, as the game definitely does some things right. A lot is borrowed from the core Horizon games, most notably the series’ large array of enemy machines with unique attack patterns and weaknesses. Add a variety of unique weapons and gadgets, interactive environments, and throwable explosives to the mix and you get combat encounters that are much more complex than your typical Lego game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Almost <em>too</em> complex for the game's less-experienced target audience. Lego Horizon Adventures throws a lot at you and playing on medium difficulty, I actually saw the Game Over screen a decent number of times. There are a variety of difficulties to choose from, but younger kids may find even the lower levels a bit overwhelming. Of course, there is a drop-in co-op feature so parents can lend a hand, and you should prepare to be called in to assist more often than you would with your typical Lego game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In between combat, Lego Horizon Adventures doesn’t offer all that much. Level design is very linear and repetitive, with players simply following the trail of studs along a narrow path to the next objective. Occasionally, there will be a short branching side path with a cache of studs or something to build at the end of it, but that's about as complex as things get.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really <em>want</em> more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 copy of Lego Horizon Adventures provided by publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment. </em></p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures carries over a lot of the things previous Horizon games did well, offering lush visuals, a likable cast, and a wide range of robo dinos to take down. Unfortunately, not everything survived blockification, with an overly-simplified story, sometimes-unsatisfying core gameplay, bland level design, and an overall lack of content resulting in a Lego game that’s a few bricks shy of a load.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-9-to-feature-two-unkillable-stalker-enemies-and-a-re4-inspired-atmosphere-%E2%80%93-rumor.1034442/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil 9 is going to feature two unkillable stalker enemies and a Resident Evil 4-inspired atmosphere, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BiohazardDeclassified" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biohazard Declassified</a> and reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, the new entry in the series, which has yet to be fully revealed, will feature two series mainstays as playable characters—Jill Valentine and Leon Kenney—who were the main focus of two playtests held in April and September.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil 9 April 2024 playtest was focused on Jill Valentine and was set in an abandoned hospital on an island. The main objective was navigating this hospital, which was decorated with a moon with an infinity symbol sigil representing a cult, to find a serum that would fight the infection affecting the residents, mold-infected zombies, which fought with a variety of weapons such as knives, axes, and scythes. Jill was also armed with some standard series weapons like a shotgun, pistol, and knife and had the ability to craft ammo using other items. She was also being pursued by an unkillable stalker enemy called the Goatman, who eventually manages to catch her and infect her at the end of the playtest. Assisting Jill via radio are Chris Redfield and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil 9 September 2024 playtest, on the other hand, was focused on Leon Kennedy and was set on a beach leading into a forest close to Mr. Simon's lab, which Leon is pursuing as he is supposedly creating bioweapon clones of Evelyn. During the journey, Leon had to fight zombies armed with multiple weapons and avoid another unkillable stalker enemy, a witch with the ability to transform into flies and cause hallucinations. Leon also has the chance to witness zombies praying to the moon by a bonfire, a scene that is likely connected to the cult represented by the moon symbol seen in Jill's story.</p>
<p><iframe title="RESIDENT EVIL 9 || NEW LEAKS | PLAYTEST GAMEPLAY DETAILS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARboFcEUfLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the supposed playtest information detailed above suggests that Resident Evil 9 will have a pretty big Resident Evil 4 influence, which wouldn't be surprising considering how the fourth entry in the series continues to be an incredibly popular game and how well last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">remake</a> has been received. As the game is rumored to have a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/">open-world</a> feel, it will be interesting to see how the development team will manage to blend these gameplay elements, if true, with a more open gameplay flow and progression.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. According to rumors, it should be released in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/">second half of 2025</a>, so a proper announcement shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Adam Williams, former lead writer of Star Wars Eclipse at Quantic Dream, has announced a new game development studio called <a href="https://www.republicgames.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republic Games</a>. To kickstart the enterprise, he received funding from KRAFTON, maker of PUBG and The Callisto Protocol. Their first game will be a dark and mature fantasy roleplaying game set in a world that somehow blends Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Orwell's 1984. In a statement, Williams said:</p>
<p><em>A tyrannical regime is brutally enforcing its ideology and crushing all dissent. But a faction of rebels seeks to overturn the tyrants and expose the lies at the heart of their doctrine.</em></p>
<p><em>We founded Republic Games to make entertaining and meaningful experiences. We're only focused on giving players what they actually want: great gameplay, great story, inspiring characters, and a fantasy experience they will remember. We believe there’s a broad base of RPG gamers who feel they aren’t being catered to anymore. They want a classic, traditional, timeless fantasy. They want a story that responds to their choices, giving them the freedom to go in any direction they want - rather than being told what to think about the story and characters. That’s the audience we’re making this for.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GcMgCNRWQAMFA_7-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before his work on Star Wars Eclipse, Adam Williams was also the lead writer on Quantic Dream's previous game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/detroit-become-human-do-humans-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit: Become Human</a>. Two actors featured in that game, Bryan and Amelia Dechart (who played Connor and Traci, respectively), have <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/1856071335728033850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> they'll return in this new fantasy RPG.</p>
<p>As for Star Wars Eclipse, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from Quantic Dream that the project was simmering. That was in September 2023. Previous rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a 2026 launch, although a delay to 2027 is reportedly not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-version-is-coming-in-2025-shift-up-expects-more-sales-than-on-ps5/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-version-is-coming-in-2025-shift-up-expects-more-sales-than-on-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that a PC version of Stellar Blade was on the way, but now Korean developer Shift Up has confirmed that we can expect it to arrive at some point in 2025. The news comes from the latest investor <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, in which the studio also revealed that its sales estimate for the PC version is higher than the PS5's, considering Steam's large user base and the recent explosive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success </a>of a similar action game, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Shift Up is also planning to expand overseas with a new office to be established in Los Angeles. The company certainly has a lot to invest after the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a> worth $320 million they raised in July. However, they also have an ongoing lawsuit to deal with regarding the Stellar Blade IP, as the owner of StellarBlade.com <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> both Shift Up and Sony for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio continues to improve the game. The recent PS5 Pro update <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-playstation-5-pro-max-graphic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the new Pro and Pro Max graphics presets, both of which support high frame rates. Next week, players can expect a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> adding Photo Mode and a DLC collaboration with Square Enix's NieR Automata. All of these patches and DLCs are almost assuredly going to be available from day one on PC.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade got a straight 9 in Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PS5 version penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-timi-studios-mobile-take-on-capcoms-popular-franchise/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-timi-studio%E2%80%99s-mobile-take-on-capcom%E2%80%99s-popular-franchise.1034385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-timi-studios-mobile-take-on-capcoms-popular-franchise/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's TiMi Studio has finally pulled the veil from Monster Hunter Outlanders, the mobile game based on CAPCOM's franchise that was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-and-tencents-timi-studio-group-are-creating-a-new-monster-hunter-game-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the press release describes the game as an open world survival title. Players will explore and survive throughout unique regions of an open world map featuring natural environments, ecosystems and monsters. They'll get to craft and build custom equipment and tools and participate in the traditional hunting experience, where they can play solo or join a hunting party of up to four people.</p>
<p>TiMi Studio Group Producer Dong Huang said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s time for mobile players to fully enjoy what makes Monster Hunter one of the most beloved franchises in gaming. Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Outlanders | Official Announcement Trailer Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvnqpQy-oZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No more information about the game's systems was released today, and no release date has been publicly set, either. The studio, which has a lot of experience adapting big franchises for mobile (they made the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/popular-strategy-game-age-of-empires-is-soon-coming-to-mobile-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires Mobile</a>, as well as the massively successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-immortal-gets-new-dev-update-activision-says-its-justified-by-call-of-duty-mobiles-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Mobile</a> and the not-quite-as-successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-unite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon UNITE</a>), said multiple playtests will be conducted in advance of the launch of Monster Hunter Outlanders. It is also likely there will be a staggered rollout throughout various regions, as usual for mobile games.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: it will be a very different experience compared to previous Monster Hunter mobile entries, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-riders-now-available-for-pre-registration-on-ios-and-android-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Riders</a> (which featured turn-based combat, whereas the series is renowned for its action combat) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Now</a>, a location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic.</p>
