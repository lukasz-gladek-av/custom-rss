			<p>Bethesda Game Studios released the Starfield Shattered Space expansion roughly two months ago. The reception, however, wasn't great. On Wccftech, the expansion got a mere six out of ten, whereas the base game was rated nine out of ten. Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>One of the complaints cited in the above quote was directly addressed by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in his recent interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game File</a> (where he also <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the true reasons behind Avowed's delay). According to the executive, Bethesda will try to tune the development efforts for future expansions and free updates.</p>
<p><em>We're always learning. Todd Howard and I were talking about Shattered Space. Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion. I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buggies</a> out? And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month.</em></p>
<p>Spencer was also quick to point out that Microsoft does not mandate the release of expansions for every game, despite the recent releases (beyond Bethesda's Starfield Shattered Space, Blizzard launched Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred and World of Warcraft: The War Within).</p>
<p><em>Not every game will do expansions. It's really left to the creators what plan they have for their stories. I think it's a great way for us to reengage players who may be lapsed. I don't like expansions that are manipulative. I want it to have a unique point of view. I don't want it to be, like, the third level that you cut before you launched.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda hasn't yet spoken about what's next after Starfield Shattered Space, but we'll be sure to report it here as soon as we learn about it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Will Continue to Be Made, Says Phil Spencer; It’s Hard to Show the Benefits of New Gaming Hardware Due to Increasing Diminishing Returns]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-will-continue-to-be-made-says-phil-spencer-it%E2%80%99s-hard-to-show-the-benefits-of-new-gaming-hardware-due-to-increasing-diminishing-returns.1036608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite Microsoft's current strategy suggesting otherwise, it seems like Xbox hardware will continue to exist in the future, although it may not be what players have come to expect based on previous console generations.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, Xbox head Phil Spencer commented on future hardware and the console market, highlighting how the console space isn't growing across all systems. "<em>We love those customers,"</em> Phil Spencer added, <em>"but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places."</em> Still, Phil Spencer has no doubt that they will release more consoles and more devices in the future, adding that they are trying to expand the concept of what Xbox means and reach success with multiple pieces of hardware, another not-so-veiled hint at the handheld system that has been confirmed to be in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">this week</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about mid-generation refresh systems like the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, the Xbox head made some interesting comments, implying in his answer not only that a system like that is no longer needed but also that they may approach future hardware in very different ways than before.&nbsp;The company thinks about hardware that can create unique value for the players and the creators on their platform and doesn't need to make a mid-generation console for their own benefit. Nowadays, it has become more difficult to show the benefits of a system like the PS5 Pro because of the diminishing return developers are seeing with increased power and the related difficulty of showing such benefits over previous generation consoles, where the jump in resolution and image quality was way bigger.</p>
<p>On mid-generation refresh consoles, the Xbox head is definitely on point, as it took multiple in-depth analyses to show how the PlayStation 5 Pro improves the vast majority of titles. As machine learning has entered the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, there's no doubt that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">AI will play a major role in future console generations</a> that will somehow address the diminishing returns issue that has become evident.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-is-working-on-an-open-world-shooter.1036452/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra's Uzupedro, Blizzard Entertainment is currently hiring personnel for an unannounced open world shooter game. The <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job</a> is for an Associate Design Director of Innovation.</p>
<p><em>At Blizzard, we craft genre-defining games and legendary worlds for all to share. Through unparalleled creativity and storytelling, we create immersive universes and iconic characters that are beloved across platforms, borders, backgrounds, and generations - only made possible by building a work environment that nurtures the artistry of game development and unleashes the aspirations of our people.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying, “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting”–the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy. </em><em>This role is anticipated to be a hybrid work position, with some work on-site and some work-from-home. The home studio for this position is Irvine, CA.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the first time Blizzard has attempted the creation of an open world shooter. I'm referring to project Titan, of course. The game should have been an MMO shooter, but after seven years of development, the studio was forced to cancel it. Some of its remnants were turned into Overwatch, which is, however, a session-based game.</p>
<p>More recently, Blizzard canceled another its survival game codenamed Odyssey. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> it, though. Anyway, the game reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/odyssey-blizzards-canceled-survival-game-reportedly-had-a-troubled-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a troubled development phase. Let's hope the same thing won't happen with this new open world shooter.</p>
