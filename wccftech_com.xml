			<p>For years (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-retires/">since 2019, to be exact</a>), the Nintendo of America president was Bowser. Not really the fictional King of the Koopas, but Doug Bowser, a man who was practically destined to work at Nintendo with that kind of last name. That era is coming to an end, however, as Doug Bowser and Nintendo <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">have announced he will retire at the end of 2025</a> from his role as president of NOA and chief operating officer. Devon Pritchard, the executive vice president of revenue, marketing, and consumer at Nintendo, will be taking his place.</p>



<p>Along with Bowser leaving his role and Pritchard stepping in, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as its chief executive officer, while maintaining his role in Nintendo Co. Ltd as managing executive officer, board member, and corporate director. Pritchard will also become a member of the board of directors at NOA and a Nintendo Co. Ltd executive officer. </p>



<p>"<em>One of my earliest videogame experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong</em>," Bowser said in a press release. "<em>Since that time,</em> <em>all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family.</em> <em>Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon's track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence she will guide the company to even greater heights</em>."</p>



<p>For her part, Pritchard added, "<em>I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.</em>"</p>



<p>As Bowser departs, Nintendo Co. Ltd president Shuntaro Furukawa added, "<em>During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo's important mission of creating smiles</em>."</p>

			<p>Xbox Series X/S console sales haven't been much to write home about in recent years. Not because there's been nothing interesting going on with them, but because there simply haven't been many sales at all. Now, new reports from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/costco-stops-selling-xbox-consoles-in-uk-and-us">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587">Destin Legarie</a> reveal there will be even less, as the major global retailer Costco has stopped selling the Xbox Series X/S line of consoles.</p>



<p>After players started to report being unable to find the Xbox Series consoles at Costco, GamesIndustry.Biz did some digging and was able to find that, as of August 6, 2025, Xbox consoles were no longer available on the Costco website. A visit to a Costco location and a call to the UK customer service department t a separate store resulted in a customer service representative confirming, "<em>We don't actually have the Xbox anymore</em>."</p>



<p>No further confirmation or statement from Costco has been released, but former IGN host and writer Destin Legarie, who has been reporting as an independent journalist in recent months, put in a similar call to Costco in the US, and was given the same answer, that Costco "<em>will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Legarie did get a little more to his answer, as he was told that it was "<em>a business decision</em>" and that Costcon doesn't "<em>have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.</p><p>They did say they have some great deals on Switch &amp; PlayStation, though.</p></div>— Destin (@DestinLegarie) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Previous reports of Xbox Series X/S sales numbers have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">entire generation's sales sitting at a little over 30 million units</a>, which has also reportedly made the device profitable for Microsoft. And what won't help those sales figures grow any further is the recent news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Microsoft is increasing the price of the Series X/S consoles in the US for the second time this year</a>.</p>



<p>For Wccftech's part, as an outlet headquartered in Canada, a browse on the Canadian Costco website also comes up empty when searching for Xbox Series X/S consoles, with only a pair of wireless Xbox-branded headphones showing <a href="https://www.costco.ca/xbox.html">on the store's dedicated Xbox page</a>. You'll have no trouble finding a <a href="https://www.costco.ca/playstation-5.html">PlayStation 5</a> or <a href="https://www.costco.ca/nintendo-switch.html">Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 console</a>, though.</p>



<p>When we put in a call to Costco Canada's customer service number, the representative said that Costco Canada does still carry Xbox consoles, but they are currently out of stock. We'll update this article if there's any change in the days ahead. </p>

			<p>UK indie developer Playtonic Games is about to launch Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of 2017's platform game Yooka-Laylee, and they have now shared the first gameplay footage and info on the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The footage was provided to IGN and you can find it embedded below. As for the Switch 2 port, Playtonic Games <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971201407001809335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X today</a> that this version will only run at 30 frames per second, on both handheld and TV mode.</p>



<p><em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode. Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch.</em></p>



<p><em>We've also received a lot of questions regarding a playable demo on Nintendo Switch 2. Unfortunately, this is not something we're able to accommodate pre-launch but are planning to release post-launch.</em></p>
