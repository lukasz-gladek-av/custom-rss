			<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a role-playing game that has already become <strong>legendary</strong>, less than one year after its release. Sweeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/"><strong>multiple Game of the Year awards</strong></a><strong> </strong>in recognition of its narrative and gameplay achievements, the game developed by French development studio Sandfall Interactive is set to have a lasting influence on the RPG genre as a whole, and it's safe to bet the first <em>Clair Obscur-like</em> game won't take too long to see the light of day.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>These awards</strong></a>, however, may be nothing compared to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">high cultural honor</strong> Sandfall Interactive has now received.</p>

			<p><strong>Nioh 3</strong> is officially out, and it only took the game three hours (one for every Nioh game) for it to become the <strong>most-played Nioh game on Steam ever</strong>. After going live at 05:00 UTC, with 22K+ jumping in right away, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">SteamDB</a>, it had already surpassed its predecessors' concurrent player counts just <strong>three hours later</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Nioh game peaked on Steam at <strong>10,649 concurrent players,</strong> meaning that Nioh 3 had more than doubled the first game's peak concurrent player count right from the start. Nioh 2's peak concurrent player count currently sits at <strong>41,325 players</strong>, which Nioh 3 surpassed by hitting <strong>42,115 players</strong> by 08:00 UTC.</p>



<p>In the hours since then, it didn't just level out at 42K. The game continued to rise and hit a peak of <strong>70,186 players an hour ago, </strong>at the time of this writing. It has since dipped slightly to just under 70K with approximately 52 players needing to sign off, but that doesn't make the accomplishment any less impressive.</p>



<p>Ultimately, concurrent player counts are not the most significant factor for single-player games, though it's worth giving them a look when a new major single-player title launches, especially in this case, when we have two previous games to compare it to. It's not yet Team Ninja's biggest release on Steam overall, though, as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a></strong> still holds that title with a <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1448440/charts/">75,906 concurrent players peak</a></strong>. That said, if Nioh 3 continues its upward trend, it'll fly by that number in short order.</p>



<p>It's great to see a veteran studio like Team NINJA finding new heights of success in 2026. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave Nioh 3 a <strong>9.8/10 in his review</strong></a>, and while he admits he has been a fan of Team NINJA's work for years, he's not the only one who shares the sentiment that Nioh 3 may just be one of Team NINJA's best games ever. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/nioh-3/"><strong>86 on Metacritic</strong>,</a> with none of its reviews sitting in the 'Negative' column and only six of its reviews in the 'Mixed' column. Hopefully, this milestone is followed by a sales milestone announcement from Team NINJA.</p>



<p>"<em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution</em>," writes De Meo. "<em>By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Sales in Japan are “Better-Than-Projected,” and It’s Hurting the Switch 2’s Profitability]]></title>

			<p>It might be difficult to imagine that increased sales of <strong>Nintendo's</strong> latest hybrid console, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, in any region, let alone its home base of Japan, would actually hurt the console's profitability. But that's exactly what's happening, according to Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>. In the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">official translation of its Q&amp;A section</a> from its third-quarter financial report, Furukawa confirmed that the "<em>better-than-projected</em>" sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 in Japan<strong> will negatively impact the Switch 2's operating and gross profit</strong>.</p>



<p>How is that the case? Because the parts Nintendo uses to manufacture the Nintendo Switch 2 are purchased in U.S. dollars. So when players in Japan purchase a Switch 2 with Japanese Yen, a currency that is currently in a downward trend, Nintendo still ends up losing money.</p>



<p>During the Q&amp;A section, an investor asked Furukawa, "<em>Considering that most procurement costs are in U.S. dollars, do I understand correctly that profitability is declining due to the continuing depreciation of the Yen?</em>" They also asked if Furukawa could explain why Switch 2 sales in Japan are doing as well as they are, and the answer, according to Furukawa, lies with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hardware-related procurement purchases are primarily made in U.S. dollars, so given the current exchange rate environment, the better-than-projected hardware sales in Japan will have a <strong>downward effect on gross profit and operating profit</strong></em>," Furukawa responded. </p>



<p>"<em>The backdrop of hardware sales in Japan trending better than our expectations was the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders during the holiday season, building on the initial momentum of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware</em>. <em>We believe that users in Japan <strong>saw these titles as an opportunity to transition to Nintendo Switch 2</strong> at a relatively higher rate compared to Nintendo Switch owners outside of Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>This interesting tidbit appeared amidst Furukawa having to answer a flurry of questions about the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage</a></strong> that is currently impacting the entire tech industry, and how Nintendo is planning to accommodate it. It's no surprise that investors only really wanted to talk about the memory shortage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/">especially after <strong>Nintendo lost $14 billion</strong> in share value towards the end of last year</a>, directly due to memory shortage fears. </p>



<p>For now, Furukawa doesn't want to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-doesnt-want-to-be-overly-influenced-by-rising-ram-costs-nintendo-switch-2-price-to-remain-stable-for-now/">"<em><strong>overly influenced</strong>" </em></a>by something that could turn out to be a short-term trend, though with recent reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-suppliers-are-taking-zero-chances-on-losing-in-a-dram-contract/">memory suppliers are taking "<em><strong>zero</strong>" </em>chances of being shortchanged</a>, Furukawa and Nintendo may end up having to increase the price of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, that's only one possible outcome, not an inevitability. In the meantime, the Switch 2 is still selling like gangbusters outside of Japan as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-17-million-first-switch-best-selling-console/">as the console sold <strong>17.37 million units</strong> in 2025</a>.</p>
