			<p>It's been twelve years since the Korean debut of Blade &amp; Soul, and now, NC America has launched Blade &amp; Soul NEO, which is a modern remaster of the original game. For those who want to get stuck in and experience Blade &amp; Soul NEO, the game is available on PC for free in North America, South America, and Europe. To access it, you can download it on the PURPLE platform, where you will then be able to dive into a world of intense PvP combat, a dramatic storyline, and a highly detailed character creation tool.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of Blade &amp; Soul NEO today, there is a new launch trailer available, which is just under a minute long, showcasing some of the brand new features of the game, as well as the iconic storyline that you'll be able to dive into as soon as you make your character.</p>

<p>Three days ago, a 20-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgUYFEQLZQI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature showcase</a> was also revealed, so you can get a glimpse into what to expect from Blade &amp; Soul NEO if you're unsure about whether this game is for you. Luckily, the game is completely free to play, so you won't need to purchase anything if you'd rather just dive in and experiment with it.</p>
<p>As a "Thank You" to all of those who participated in the Pre-Registration event, NC America will now be offering the Pre-Registration Package to all players. For those who haven't yet <a href="https://store.plaync.com/wallet/us/coupon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an account</a>, you can do so on the website and use the code "THANKYOU" on your profile to get the rewards.</p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is a modernized reinterpretation of the original Blade &amp; Soul, where gamers will get to explore the wuxia-themed world and go on an expansive journey as a hero to restore honor to their clan, the Hongmoon Clan. There are four playable races to choose from and seven classes that you'll get to try out, all with their own benefits and unique abilities to keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>For those interested, there will be a free and premium Battle Pass available. The Season 1 Battle Pass is 1,500 Divine Gems ($15) and will give you exclusive consumables that can aid in story progression, as well as provide you with quality-of-life benefits as you traverse the world.</p>
<p>As the game advances, there will be several months of free content updates for Blade &amp; Soul NEO, including balance patches, bug fixes, and brand-new features. These updates will begin in March.</p>
