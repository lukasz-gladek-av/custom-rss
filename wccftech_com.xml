Prime Gaming has its own client where you can install the games, but Prime Gaming also gives away games on the Epic Games Store and GOG.com.

By using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/primegaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Luna</a>, you will be able to play games on devices you already own, including your Fire TV, if you want the games on the big screen.

<p>There are also more games available on the Amazon Luna catalog, but these are the games that have been added to the catalog specifically for the month of November. Compared to games given via Prime Gaming, these games are only available while you have an active Prime membership or a Luna+ membership. You can also link your Ubisoft Connect account to Amazon Luna and your GOG account. This will allow you to play games that are supported by Luna on your devices.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix is live now on the popular free-to-play battle royale game. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking example</a> set with Fortnite Season OG, the island has been reset to the Chapter 2 map, albeit with several twists that will unroll throughout the season.</p>
<p>Starting right now, the Agency grounds are now known as The Doggpound, the new headquarters and home base for Snoop Dogg's enterprise. Players who venture there will have the opportunity to fight him and turn him into an ally, as well as obtain his Snoop's Drum Gun Mythic weapon.</p>
<p>In the second week of Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix, Eminem himself will take ownership of the Grotto cave and establish a restaurant called Mom's Spaghetti there. If you head to Mom's Spaghetti and defeat Eminem, you'll gain his support and receive the Mythic RG Minigun - a lyrical, rapid-fire weapon.</p>
<p>In the third week, hip-hop rapper Ice Spice is set to appear on Shark Island, which will temporarily be renamed Ice Island. Ice Spice is turning it into an ominous-looking shopping mall. If you defeat her, you're getting her support and the Ice Spice's Grappler weapon.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale event, which will go live on November 30 at 2 PM Eastern Time, will feature a homage to Juice Wrld. All players who log in between November 30 at 1 AM Eastern Time and December 1 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit.</p>

<p>The biggest news for Fortnite is arguably the imminent addition of a brand new cosmetic item called 'Kicks.' Epic Games explained:</p>
<p><em>The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite originals. Look out for other brands to join the lineup in the future! Kicks will be compatible with over 500 of the most popular Fortnite Outfits to start, with more than 95% of Outfits compatible by Spring of next year. While there are a few Outfits that are particularly challenging to style Kicks for, we’re working hard to make sure that as many Outfits as possible can throw on a fresh pair.</em></p>
<p>The first pair of Nike Air Jordan Kicks will be available from the Shop starting on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
