            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal dispute between Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios against Valve first started in 2021 and has since been granted class-action status. This was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, where they stated that they saw a court document that shows the motion for class certification to be granted. United States District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted the motion. By doing this, it means that the antitrust lawsuit that was started by Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios now has the potential to become a significantly larger dispute.</p>
<p>Wolfire first <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-founder-gabe-newell-ordered-to-ensure-in-court-presence-amid-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit/">filed the lawsuit in April 2021</a>, claiming that Valve's commission is "an extraordinarily high cut," constituting anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit also argues that Valve uses its dominance to "exploit publishers and consumers." However, this claim was actually dismissed in November 2021. Once that happened, the developer decided to reevaluate, update, and adapt their arguments in May 2022. As this happened, VR game developer Dark Catt Studios also filed its own antitrust lawsuit in June 2021. Some of the claims they made were dismissed, but they were allowed to continue the lawsuit based on some of their claims that were found to have validity.</p>
<p>Since the lawsuits were so similar, a court order was then issued in July 2022 to confirm that both cases would be consolidated into one.</p>
<p>The document says that the class action will apply to any developers, publishers, or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale. The class action refers to the 30% cut the firm takes from each purchase. The class action will be referring to the people on or after January 28, 2017.</p>
<p>Valve is not the only one who has been involved in a lawsuit for similar problems as of late. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Sony is also involved in a class action lawsuit</a>, as they removed the ability for retailers like Amazon, GameStop, or Best Buy to directly sell digital codes for PlayStation games. This led to a feeling that Sony was monopolizing the titles, and causing consumers to have to pay higher prices than they could have at an alternative retailer.</p>
<p>In the order, the judge has made the decision to deny Valve's request to exclude the testimony of an expert. This expert is Dr. Steven Schwartz, who has called both studios to argue their case for them. In this case, Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt will both be the class representatives for the action.</p>
<p>At the moment, there's no telling how long this class action will take, as the class action for Sony isn't due to appear in court for a couple of years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-top-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends, you'll find that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from in the game, all of which have different priorities. Top lane may be a little bit daunting, as you are the sole person in the lane and are responsible for everything that happens up there. However, there is a lot of fun to be had and a ton of potential to snowball and end up being the team carry. For those wanting to experiment with the top lane, here are some of the best top laners for beginners.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers</a></p>
<h2>Best Top Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of top laners out there, with more being added all the time. However, some are significantly easier than others to play and can help you get to grips with the functionality of the lane.</p>
<p>One of the easiest top laners to try out is&nbsp;<strong>Nasus.</strong> He's been a mainstay in the game since its release and has one of the easiest kits to use. You just have to make sure that you are executing minions with your Q, and your damage will start to ramp up very fast. You also have the ability to slow your opponents significantly, making a chase much easier, especially if your jungler is ganking you. On top of that, if you are the one being chased, using your slow can also make it much easier for you to get away in sticky situations. Your Ultimate is excellent, as it makes you much bigger with a bigger health bar and makes it much harder to kill you. This is great if you're in a sticky situation or if you find yourself in a large team fight.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Darius</strong> is another typical top laner that you'll see in lane. He can be a massive pain to deal with, which makes it a great idea to learn him early on. Darius' abilities center around bleed damage, which can allow you to get some great early-game kills on opponents, especially if they are relatively squishy. It can be a bit tricky learning the rotation of his moveset, but once you've gotten the hang of it, Darius can make the opponent's life a misery.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Garen</strong> is another mainstay in League of Legends, and was one of the first champions to be released when the game came out. His moveset is very simple and is one of the easiest top laners to learn in League of Legends if you're a beginner. If you manage to get kills early on, you can snowball quickly and become a carry for the team, especially in team fights.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While&nbsp;<strong>Maokai</strong> isn't typically a top laner, he is currently very viable in the top lane thanks to the current meta. He's very versatile and works in both the mid lane and bot lane as a support. Roaming with Maokai is always a great decision and is a great damage sponge. As a result, he makes a great frontline if you're in a team fight, as he can protect the squishier champions, as well as root enemies using his Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are many other great top laners out there in League of Legends, all ranging in difficulty. Have fun experimenting, and good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-with-aerith%E2%80%99s-briana-white.1047540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-with-aeriths-briana-white/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, Square Enix has demonstrated an exceptional talent for casting, discovering outstanding actors who brought new characters to life with remarkable depth. One such actor is Ben Starr, whose performance made Final Fantasy XVI protagonist Clive even more memorable. The same can be said about the Final Fantasy VII Remake cast, who redefined beloved characters with fresh and compelling performances.</p>
<p>Among the talented cast of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Briana White’s portrayal of Aerith Gainsborough stands out as truly exceptional. Bringing the young flower seller from Midgar’s Sector 5 to life was a challenge even for a seasoned performer, let alone a relative newcomer, but Briana delivered two unforgettable performances that earned her a Golden Joystick Award for Best Supporting Performer and a nomination for Best Performance at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As a lifelong fan of Final Fantasy VII since its original release in 1997, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak with Briana about her journey as Aerith, the Remake project, her streaming career, and much more. You can find our chat below. Enjoy!</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I felt the pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your nomination for Best Supporting Actor for this year’s Golden Joystick Awards and Best Performance for The Game Awards! A victory would have been completely deserved because you masterfully brought Aerith to life and made her an even more compelling character. How does it feel to receive such glowing recognition for your first video game voice-acting job?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much. It's completely surreal. When I got the audition, I thought I would never book it. When I booked the audition, I thought I would get recast during recording. Now, after three games, seeing my work get recognized in this way is incredibly special. I'm so grateful for this journey and it has totally changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith is among the most popular Final Fantasy characters ever released. Why do you think she resonates with so many people and continues to be loved even decades after the original game’s release?</strong></p>
<p>As a character, Aerith left a lasting impact on people with the original Final Fantasy VII because of her surprise death early on in the game. I think her story reminded gamers around the world that life is short and fragile, so don't take it for granted. For many people, Aerith’s death helps process what it means to lose someone you love, which is a universal experience. I think that's why her impact is still felt to this day. With Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, we get the opportunity to fall in love with Aerith all over again, entrenched in the memories of the past and always colored by an ephemeral fear that we might lose her again. It's a very complex and beautiful experience.</p>
<p><strong>After being cast to play Aerith in Final Fantasy VII Remake, did you feel the pressure of the expectations fans may have had for playing such a beloved character?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I felt that pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith's role in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is more central in the story than in Final Fantasy VII Remake, and as her importance in the story increased, she became more complex. How did you prepare for the challenge of bringing an even more nuanced version of the character to life? Has your experience in Remake taught you anything that helped you take on this challenge?</strong></p>
<p>Through Final Fantasy VII Remake, I was really overwhelmed with the technical challenges of voice acting for the first time. Keeping my dialogue clean of the tiniest of mouth noises, choosing my character’s diction, learning how to make effort sounds, discovering how to project without blowing out my voice, keeping my breath grounded, and, all the while, maintaining motivation and emotion for the character. For Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, I had the unique challenge of taking on a younger, softer version of Aerith while using the same exact script from the original game. For Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I had all that experience under my belt, so I could really just act. I let Aerith's character shine through like she deserves, focusing entirely on telling her story. I feel incredibly grateful to have had the experience of the prior two games to get to know her and, really, even myself.</p>
<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the culmination of Aerith's role in the story. Did knowing how her story concludes influence your performance in any way?</strong></p>
<p>When recording for the ending of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it was a challenge to let go of any<br>
preconceived notions based on the original game. Knowing that Aerith dies in the original Final Fantasy VII wouldn't help me in the booth. So I really had to let that all go and focus on each line, each moment of telling Aerith’s story. Of course, when recording the end of any game, the emotion is heavy, and the impact of these scenes is felt by us as we are crafting them. It was a very powerful moment in the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>With Aerith being such a well-loved character, how do you balance staying true to expectations while bringing your own interpretation to the role?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of that is decided collaboratively as a team. As a localization, we rely on what we receive from the Japanese team a lot. The writers translate the script, I listen to the legendary Maaya Sakamoto for every sound Aerith makes, and then I give my best versions of what I think that should sound like in English. From there, the director chooses which takes he thinks will fit best or guides additional takes if necessary. So, in order to honor both Maaya’s version and Aerith’s legacy through time and my own heart, it really takes a village.</p>
<p><strong>You are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrFt_rBvaE&amp;list=PLeNs2fU0UP2UY41Oj0w5kzMqA4Gwt4JnY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on Twitch and YouTube. Is this the first time </strong><strong>you are experiencing the full game? And if so, what’s been leaving a strong impression on you?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my stream on Twitch is my first time playing through the game! There are some things I<br>
remember recording and some things I don't, and on top of that, I never get access to any part of the script that doesn't have Aerith involved. I also don't see the finished product all put together. So to play the game for the first time is really special and to share that with my community is even more special.</p>
<p><strong>Are you dreading the moment you will see *that* sequence at the end of the game? I know I did, despite having known about it since I played through the original for the first time back in 1997.</strong></p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team have done such a great job of making the Remake series still feel fresh and new and unknown, so mostly, I'm just happy to be along for the ride! It is surreal for me because I helped make the game, but while playing it, I still get to be just a fan for some parts and enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Fans have been discussing since the release of the original who Cloud is really in love with. Knowing these characters as intimately as very few others, what do you think? Who’s Cloud’s real sweetheart?</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the strengths of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the connection between all of the characters. When it comes to world-saving stakes, all of the main party put their lives on the line for each other. There is no truer love than that. As for romantic love, it completely depends on the player and the scenes they unveil as they play with their preferred companions. That's the fun of it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Voicing Aerith has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, more than in the original, it definitely feels like Aerith still has a thing for Zack, even after his death. What do you think are her real feelings towards Cloud?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think anyone could play Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion and come away with any doubt that Aerith and Zack care for each other. From Aerith’s perspective, Zack disappeared and hasn't contacted anyone in years. Aerith makes it very clear in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth that she cares for Cloud as well for who he is.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a story moment from the original you are really looking forward to seeing in Part 3?</strong></p>
<p>As I haven't played through the original, I look forward to discovering the silly moments that make Final Fantasy so fun. In addition, after all these years, I'm really looking forward to the final confrontation with Sephiroth.</p>
<p><strong>If you weren’t playing Aerith, is there any character in Final Fantasy VII you would have liked to bring to life?</strong></p>
<p>I would have been thrilled to play any character in the game, even an NPC shouting at Cloud to come buy an ether. But if I had to pick someone from the main cast, Tifa is such an amazing character that I would have loved to take that on as an actor- not that I could ever compare to Britt’s incredible work. On the other hand, I bet voicing Scarlet is an absolute blast.</p>
<p><strong>If you could use one word to describe your experience being Aerith in Final Fantasy VII, which would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p>Dream. Because voicing her has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.</p>
<p><strong>You have been running your Strange Rebel Gaming Twitch and YouTube channel way before you played Aerith for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Did the popularity of your playing the role impact your streaming career?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, it did. I was streaming to 90 people before my casting as Aerith was announced. That's still a very solid number as a variety streamer and I am incredibly proud of what I built with Strange Rebel Gaming before Final Fantasy joined my resume. When Final Fantasy VII Remake was released during the COVID-19 global lockdown, I was very suddenly streaming to 8000 people. That was a bit overwhelming for both me and my moderators.</p>
<p>Now it has settled, and I am streaming to about 1000 people, which I feel very lucky to say. My community of Strange Rebels are some of the kindest, smartest, funniest, and most generous people out there. They restore my faith in humanity a bit. Over the past few years, the Strange Rebel Community has raised over $53,000 for charities like World Central Kitchen, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and Gamers Outreach. I am most proud of that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for you after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Any future projects you can talk about?</strong></p>
<p>Nope! I am auditioning and waiting and auditioning and waiting. Such is the industry. But in the<br>
meantime, I continue to stream and make content that I hope brightens people's days, even just a little bit. That makes everything worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Far From Home has announced that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly anticipated Co-Op game mode</a> is coming to Forever Skies, the first-person post-apocalyptic survival game. This Co-Op game mode is set to go live on December 9 and will allow you to team up with friends up to four, working together to find and hoard resources, build your airships, and fight for survival while surrounded by toxic dust. The new game mode will be available to all Forever Skies players on Steam. To showcase the upcoming game mode, you can watch their release trailer for Co-Op to see what you can find yourself getting into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies |  Co-op Update Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGZ7v8N66t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
