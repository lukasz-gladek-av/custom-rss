			<p>The European gaming market didn't have a great year for sales. GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring revealed this tidbit during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-in-review-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GI Microcast show</a>, confirming that sales of new games went down by 29% compared to last year, as registered by GSD data.</p>
<p>2023 was always going to be a tough comparison. Last year saw the release of games like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Diablo IV, Mortal Kombat 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy XVI, just to name a few. 2024 just didn't have the same sheer triple-A power when it came to its schedule. Dring admitted as much in the podcast while also singling out two games that underperformed: Star Wars Outlaws and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>Sales of new games in 2024 versus new games in 2023, and let's remember 2023 was a big year for new games, were down 29%, almost a third, year-on-year. Next year's the return of big blockbuster new games, even from February when you've got that sort of triple threat of Assassin's Creed Shadows and Avowed (I know Av</em><em>owed isn't that big) and Monster Hunter Wilds all in the same window. And there's all the games that were announced during The Game Awards, there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Elden Ring coming out</a>, and there's a Grand Theft Auto, which obviously is the big thing. </em></p>
<p><em>There's a new Nintendo console, and there's gonna be loads and loads and loads of games next year, but I'm alarmed by this data because, despite the fact that there weren't a lot of major titles, the big Star Wars game of the year only got to number 45 in a year where there wasn't a lot of games coming out. </em><em>In terms of the traditional big blockbuster Christmas games, you had Call of Duty, which did well, and you had Dragon Age, which did not. That is disappointing, though, that position. T</em><em>hat was it. Dragon Age&nbsp;had the market to itself and it couldn't find an audience, and that really is scary as we move into the following year.</em></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ranked #14 and #19, respectively, when it comes to the new games European chart. But switching to the full chart that also includes games released in previous years, they drop to #45 and #68. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> is similar in that it ranked in the ninth place among new games but only #34 overall. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, which was the twelfth best-selling new game of 2024 but only ranked #43 in the global chart.</p>
<p>Only five new games performed at least decently this year in Europe: Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO (#13), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> (#12), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> (#6), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (#3). Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 25 dominated European sales in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This year saw a lot of majorly successful games on Steam, with the best sellers being revealed based on total gross revenue earned in 2024. Although these are the top-selling games, the revenue for the titles hasn't been revealed, and they are separated into categories. If you want to see what games are in each category, you can check out the official list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/bestof2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a>. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platinum: 1st-12th</li>
<li>Gold 13th-24th</li>
<li>Silver 25th-50th</li>
<li>Bronze 51st-100th</li>
</ul>
<p>As there are a lot of games, we won't be discussing every single one that has made it onto the top charts. There are also sub-categories into which the games are organized. On the Steam page, you'll see there are categories for Top Sellers, New Releases, Most Played, Steam Deck, Controller, and VR. This allows you to see what statistics they are measured by, which includes top concurrent players as well as top-grossing revenue for the year.</p>
<p>In the platinum category for top-grossing revenue, live-service games like Apex Legends and Counter-Strike 2 continue to be on top, alongside games like PUBG Battlegrounds and Destiny 2. When it comes to premium titles, it's no surprise that award-winning titles like Black Myth: Wukong, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring are on the list. This year saw Black Myth: Wukong win <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">multiple awards</a> at various ceremonies, with Shadow of the Erdtree raking in a couple, too. Despite being released last year, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be majorly successful, and Larian Studios is dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">providing consistent updates</a> and new content for players to dive into.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the New Releases category, titles like Path of Exile II, Heldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and, of course, Black Myth: Wukong are all in the platinum category. When it comes to how they decide which games go into the platinum category, they look at the first two weeks of the game's revenue after its released, and that is the deciding factor as to which game is best-selling and is deserving of being in the platinum category.</p>
<p>When it comes to peak concurrent players, most of the games are live-service titles that have been out for a while. Specifically, the top-played games with over 450,000 peak players are in the category, which consists of games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, and the newly released title Marvel Rivals. However, there are some premium games on there, such as Helldivers 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Elden Ring.</p>
<p>While 2024 has felt like a bit of a quieter year for gaming, there have been some majorly successful releases, with some of them going on to win multiple awards.</p>
<p>What has been your top game of 2024?</p>
