			<p>The latest NACON Connect is over, delivering some big news for fans of RoboCop, Styx, Cthulhu, and more.</p>
<p>Let's start with the man of steel. Following the success of RoboCop: Rogue City, which was the publisher's biggest launch and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2023-solid-transitory-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the vote of our community</a> for Best Shooter Game of 2023, Teyon is back with a standalone expansion titled RoboCop: Rogue City â€“ Unfinished Business. Due to launch this Summer, it will task players to reach the top of Omni Tower, now overrun by elite mercenaries. RoboCop will have access to new weapons, brutal finishing moves, and special missions that will take players through intense flashbacks and offer the chance to play as Alex Murphy (prior to the accident) for the first time in a video game.</p>

<p>The showcase featured another return. The sneaky goblin <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styx</a> will come back in Styx: Blades of Greed, once again developed by Cyanide Studio. The few details shared by NACON point to the game keeping its formula:&nbsp;open-ended environments, a vast range of powers and tools, and<br>
multiple approaches to completing objectives. The mission is simple: stealing Quartz, a rare and magical resource. The game will be out in the Fall of 2025.</p>

<p>Cthulhu aficionados also have plenty of reasons to rejoice today with two new game announcements. Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss is in development at Big Bad Wolf (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-5-demons-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Council</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a>). It will be a first-person thriller/investigative adventure where players are put in the shoes of Noah, an agent of Ancile, a secret division of Interpol devoted to occult cases. Ancile investigates the mysterious disappearance of miners in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, eventually leading him to the labyrinthine prison of R'lyeh, an ancient sunken city where Cthulhu itself is imprisoned. This game will launch next year.</p>

<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, on the other hand, is a first-person cooperative horror game in development at ACE Team (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-from-zenos-ace-team-gets-november-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clash</a>, Zeno Clash) where players take the roles of Conquistadores on an expedition to discover a legendary underground city rumored to hold untold treasures. Being a Cthulhu game, they'll have to question their sanity at all times and stick together to try and make it out alive when the game launches later this year.</p>

<p>NACON Connect also featured extensive new footage of Rogue Factor's action/adventure game Hell Is Us. The video showed investigation mechanics in which players must rely on their powers of observation, deduction, and intuition to progress through the game and uncover the secrets of these mysterious lands. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-to-release-september-4-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is slated to debut on September 4</a>.</p>
