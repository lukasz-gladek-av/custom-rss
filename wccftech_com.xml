			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing PlayStation 5 Pro support alongside some other changes and fixes.</p>
<p>Following the October 31st patch, the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM released earlier this year will be able to take advantage of the increased power and new features of the mid-generation console by Sony launching next week. The patch adds a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option to the Graphics section in the Options menu, and a Balanced option will be found under Graphics Quality in the Graphics section of the Options menu.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Dragon's Dogma 2 latest patch also fixes some quests, Pawn, minimap, and spell issues. You can find all the changes introduced by today's patch by heading over to the game's <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/">official website.</a></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
