			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-is-out-next-week-adding-mods-and-new-cinematics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3 modding scene</a> might not be quite as thriving as that of a Bethesda game like Skyrim, there are still a couple of major projects to follow, such as the Path to Menzoberranzan mod. Modder Lotrich, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PathToMenzoberranzan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the help of over 1,309 Patreon supporters</a>, has established a team of more than 130 contributors.</p>



<p>According to a project update shared this week on the Path to Menzoberranzan Discord channel, the team operates under a centralized structure. There is a group of project directors for each branch of development, and each project director is assisted by leads (coordinators) and seniors, who help oversee project contributors across different departments.</p>



<p>While the full release of the Baldur's Gate 3 mod is still years away, the first playable Alpha is estimated to be available in the first half of 2026. The team said it will include the game's prologue, which should be similar in scope to the Nautiloid of BG3. Over time, more updates will be released to introduce new locations and advance the narrative. The extent of these updates will depend on feedback and the feasibility of implementation. Path to Menzoberranzan reportedly features many interconnected storylines, and the creators want users to experience a satisfying portion of the story with each new update.</p>



<p>As Forgotten Realms experts will have already surmised from the title, the mod adds an entirely new standalone adventure focused on the bright mercantile city of Athkatla and the dark and perilous nature of the Underdark, all the way to the legendary capital of the Drow.</p>



<p>Throughout the story, which spans three acts like Baldur's Gate 3, players will revisit areas from Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn while also exploring entirely new lands. The campaign is set to feature a new protagonist with a new personal quest and up to 8 brand-new companions, each with their own personal agendas and some of whom will be romanceable.</p>



<p>In Act I, players will visit Athkatla, shop at iconic places like the Adventurer Mart, and explore the long-abandoned dungeon once occupied by the malicious mage Jon Irenicus. In Act II, the player will begin their journey to the titular location, Menzoberranzan, and Act III will feature the drow city itself.</p>



<p>The Path to Menzoberranzan modding team also promised the following features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fully voiced companions and world NPCs—no AI-generated voiceovers;</li>



<li>Custom concept art and 3D assets as needed;</li>



<li>Handcrafted visual style for Menzoberranzan, built from scratch;</li>



<li>Multiple side quests on top of the main overarching story;</li>



<li>New items, outfits, NPC models;</li>



<li>Original musical theme.</li>
</ul>



<p>Another large-scale Baldur's Gate 3 mod<span>, '<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-the-grand-theater-sell-your-lute-to-the-devil-gets-first-playable-version/" target="_blank">The Grand Theater - Sell your Lute to the Devil</a>', is currently 25% complete,</span> according to its creators. If you're instead looking for a mod that lets you play against your friends, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-versus-mode-closest-thing-game-master-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Versus mode</a> is the one to get.</p>

			<p>It's no secret that Marvel Games and PlayStation's Insomniac Games have a good relationship. We wouldn't have three <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man games</a> and one upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine game</a> without a strong relationship between both companies, and in a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games">Game Informer</a>, we got a bit more insight into just how good Marvel feels about the relationship.</p>



<p>General manager of Marvel Games, Haluk Mentes, spoke at length about the importance of Marvel Games and the studios it collaborates with being aligned in their approach to making anything with Marvel characters, and making something that is authentically Marvel.</p>



<p>"<em>The challenge is more complex: authenticity doesn't necessarily mean one-to-one fidelity to source or reference material, whether it's comics or animation or movies. It's much deeper in that we allow our collaborating teams to reimagine 'familiar yet original' incarnations of our characters based on their own creative DNA...We absolutely do not want to be derivative. Otherwise, what's the point of working with some of the best talent out there?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There’s a great sense of responsibility at play here: Marvel is an almost 90-year-old creative brand, yet it’s as fresh as ever because during all that time, each new generation grew up with Marvel, ultimately became creators and left their mark, and then passed the torch to the next generation.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We also actively seek collaborators that want to take on the same mantle. As is usually the case, once we complete a project together, they, too, become “Marvel.” Marvel’s Wolverine with our dear friends at Insomniac Games is perhaps the epitome of this philosophy. We have been working together for more than a decade and developed such a shorthand across multiple Marvel’s Spider-Man games that when the time finally came to bring Logan back in spectacular and visceral fashion, it was obvious to everyone on our team that Insomniac was the perfect choice. It was our shared culture and values that brought us together, and we’re so proud to continue collaborating for many years to come.</em>"</p>
