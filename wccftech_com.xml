			<p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of an expanded partnership with AMD to make next-generation devices, AMD CEO Lisa Su also posted her own statement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a brief video message</a>:</p>
<p><em>AMD and Microsoft are advancing a bold, shared vision for the future of gaming one that enables seamless gameplay across any screen, placing gamers at the center of the experience anywhere. We're so excited to be deepening our relationship with Microsoft and build on the over two decades of partnership, innovation, and trust. From the earliest days of the Xbox 360, to the most advanced consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and S, and the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> ROG Xbox Ally handhelds.</em></p>
<p><em>Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimized chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility, so gamers can access their favorite titles across platforms, delivering on a promise to both gamers and developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Together, we are building a vibrant, open ecosystem that delivers the next generation of graphics and immersive gameplay, powered by AI that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering. From console to cloud to handheld, AMD and Microsoft are building the future of immersive gaming. We are so excited to be working with Microsoft to bring all of this tech to gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>The first products born from this deeper partnership to hit the market will be the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch in late October, according to a recent rumor. The next-generation Xbox consoles aren't likely to be released before 2027. Interestingly, both Microsoft president Sarah Bond and AMD's Lisa Su have underlined that the new chips will also power the Xbox cloud offering, which is currently much less attractive than competitors like NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, whose servers are equipped with more powerful hardware. This should make streaming Game Pass titles way more interesting for subscribers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blood-message-is-a-stunning-single-player-action-adventure-game-from-naraka-bladepoint-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, 24 Entertainment (the studio behind the successful free-to-play Battle Royale game <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</a>) and NetEase Games announced Blood Message, a single player story-driven action/adventure game, with a stunning trailer. Zhipeng Hu, Lead Producer and NetEase Executive Vice President, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message. As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game is set during the final years of the Tang dynasty. As a mere messenger who joined the Dunhuang uprising, players must traverse a treacherous 1,000-mile journey back to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang empire. They must cross lethal landscapes, including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia, to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain and overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes — not emperors or generals, but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, a father and son must navigate a crumbling world, torn between their duty to their country and their love for their family. 24 Entertainment reckons that the world has heard enough stories of emperors and generals, which is why Blood Message is different. The studio also described the game as linear and narrative-driven, not to mention anchored in cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Players can look forward to visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics. It will be, according to the developers, a deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity. Throughout Blood Message, players will traverse expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang.</p>

<p>The game is being developed for PC and consoles, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with proprietary technologies crafted by 24 Entertainment. There is no release window yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lies of P Has Sold Over 3 Million Units]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer NEOWIZ has <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Soulslike game Lies of P has surpassed 3 million copies sold globally.</p>
<p>It had been a while since we got a sales update. The only official one was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> in October 2023, when NEOWIZ revealed that the game had sold over one million units in less than one month.</p>
<p>Of course, when interpreting Lies of P sales figures, we also have to consider that the game was available on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service from day one. As such, many more gamers will have actually played it. Furthermore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a rumor</a>, the game might be in development for the Nintendo Switch 2. If that's the case, sales could get even higher.</p>
<p>Lies of P recently launched its Overture DLC, which received the same score (8/10) as the base game in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>. Here's a quote from the article:</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</em></p>
<p>Looking ahead, a Lies of P sequel is all but inevitable considering these sales. NEOWIZ isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, though; we know they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a sci-fi horror game project, and they've also signed publishing deals with several developers, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-studio-will-publish-an-upcoming-noir-western-rpg-from-ex-cdpr-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WolfEye Studios</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-will-publish-the-detective-adventure-game-kill-the-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowlight</a>.</p>
