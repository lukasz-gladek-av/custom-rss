			<p>Today, it was announced by Blizzard Entertainment that BlizzCon, a celebration of all of Blizzard's communities, is making a return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September of 2026. Those who want to attend will be able to do so on Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, 2026. To celebrate the news, a trailer has been released. It's just under 40 seconds long but helps build up a little bit of hype for the event.</p>
<p><iframe title="BlizzCon | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrMT3bgU-fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>BlizzCon has been a major event for Blizzard Entertainment since 2005, where it allows members of the team to connect with the ever-growing and constantly changing community, as well as allowing players of Blizzard games to connect with each other at the event. 2026 will, of course, be bringing back some of the staples that have always popped up at previous BlizzCons, such as the Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, Darkmoon Faire, and hands-on gameplay.</p>
<p>Along the way, there have been many changes to how BlizzCon works, as well as new events to constantly bring something new to the dedicated community, and some in-game rewards for those lucky enough to attend it in person.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2022, there has not been an in-person BlizzCon, with a lot of it being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and people having to self-isolate. There were also plans for<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-delayed-indefinitely-game-announcements-coming/"> BlizzConline</a> during this time, but those plans also fell through, with it only happening in February 2021, despite there being plans for it in 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's finally making a return to an in-person event, where fans and friends can gather at the Anaheim Convention Center to get some sneak peeks at upcoming content across Blizzard's mainstay franchises, such as World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, and Hearthstone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.blizzcon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> is posted on the official BlizzCon website, where more details will be shared in the future about what will be available at the event. The statement also goes on to say:</p>
<p><em>We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure</em>.</p>
<p>While it is far too early to even begin to speculate what could be presented at BlizzCon 2026, it's likely that there will be information about the Worldsoul Saga in World of Warcraft as it gets closer to the reveal of the second expansion, Midnight. It's not been stated as of yet when people can expect the release of the second expansion in the saga, but it's possible we'll see it at BlizzCon next year.</p>
