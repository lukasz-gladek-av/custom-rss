			<p>Senior combat designer at Obsidian Rob Donovan and lead systems designer Kyle Koenig dove into the combat systems and changes to combat and gameplay in<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/"> The Outer Worlds 2</a> in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPlPgane1E">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>They talked a bit about some new changes to player movement, like how you can parkour now in The Outer Worlds 2, meaning that you can grab up onto new areas, slide into cover, and you can even spec your character to be better at things like shooting while sliding.</p>
<p>What they mostly talked about was the design philosophy the team had with combat in The Outer Worlds 2. For example, while you'll have plenty more options regarding how you want to handle a combat encounter, the enemies you'll face have also been designed to try and surprise you, and be more challenging to deal with.</p>
<p>A key aspect of that is the removal of level scaling for The Outer Worlds 2. Donovan described enemies as being classed in "<em>tiers</em>" this time around. So while you'll face a few enemies meant to be a little more difficult for newbies in the game's opening areas, by the time you've explored quite a bit and leveled up, you can return to those opening areas and crush anything in your path.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of thought put into making every path viable in combat, so there's no one playstyle that players feel like they should use, even if it goes against how they want to play the game. That said, Donovan did also state later in the video that the team considers The Outer Worlds 2 to be a "<em>ranged-first</em>" game with&nbsp;"<em>melee in the mix</em>," so players wanting a more melee-focused experience might be let down.</p>
<p>Another interesting point both Donovan and Koenig made was how the team looked at games like Destiny 2 and Call of Duty to try and improve gunplay in The Outer Worlds 2, to ensure that even if you're not creating a character that is going to be the most adept gunslinger, using any gun in your arsenal still feels good.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is currently set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime later this year, with more information coming on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">June 8</a>, after Xbox has its big summer showcase for the year. Hopefully we'll learn the exact release date by then.</p>

			<p>Earlier this month, during NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) Show 2025 in Las Vegas, the 8K Association demonstrated a 'world first' for 8K@120Hz gaming on HDMI 2.1. The spec is notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-2-1-detailed-8k60hz-4k120hz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited to 8K@60Hz</a>, but Display Stream Compression allowed them to overcome that limitation. The PC was entirely powered by AMD hardware and ran Guerrilla's Horizon Forbidden West game, which is known to be well-optimized.</p>
<p>Here's the excerpt from the <a href="https://8kassociation.com/industry-info/nab-2025-buzzes-and-a-world-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official 8K Association website</a>:</p>
<p><em>At one end of the booth, there was a demonstration of real time gaming using an AMD-based gaming PC and a special 65″ TV flown in from Korea by 8K Association member, Samsung, that supported 120fps display. The game was Horizon Forbidden West and the TV was a modified Neo QLED 8K set with</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)</em></li>
<li><em>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</em></li>
<li><em>FreeSync Premium Pro</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The PC was from Maingear and used an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU. The game supports the Steam platform which allows analytics to be shown and confirming the 120Hz operation. The game was rendered at 5K and was then internally upscaled using AMD ML-based FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology.</em></p>
<p><em>The signal was sent to the TV using HDMI 2.1b with DSC support and the impressive smooth visuals attracted a lot of attention from visitors, especially those that were already aware of the game, which is visually very impressive.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NAB Show 2025: 8K Association Talks About 8K 120Hz Gaming Over HDMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5mUeSZJOs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>8K gaming certainly still feels a little overkill, especially when some PC games have performance issues even at far lower resolutions. However, the latest GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD make it more manageable than ever with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and AMD FSR 4 Frame Generation. Actually, Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-16-k-resolution-rtx-5090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown running at playable frame rates even at 16K resolution on the GeForce RTX 5090</a>, and that's without Frame Generation, which is not supported in that game.</p>
<p>With the HDMI 2.2 spec <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-2-2-now-confirmed-to-debut-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025 and its official release scheduled for later this year, 8K displays will likely become more common thanks to the doubled (96 Gbps) bandwidth. At the same time, it may well take a few years - we'll probably get a new generation of GPUs before 8K gaming really becomes widely attainable with both hardware and software.</p>

			<p>Embark Studios, the studio behind the multiplayer shooter hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/">The Finals,</a> is set to have a playtest for its next release, Arc Raiders, which is due out sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Beginning this coming Wednesday, April 30, Embark will host its second playtest for Arc Raiders. The first playtest for the game happened last October and was only open to PC players. This time, it'll be open to players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside PC players, and it will run from Wednesday to next Sunday, May 4.</p>
<p>Embark showed off a new trailer for Arc Raiders today, ahead of the playtest kicking off on Wednesday, showing a bit more gameplay, including some shots of players battling giant robots.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Tech Test 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTRRb7ODhjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arc Raiders is a third-person shooter, rather than another FPS, and is a PvPvE extraction shooter. Back in 2021, it was initially meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">debut game</a> for Embark Studios, before it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">delayed</a> several times, due in part to it changing from its original vision, since it wasn't always meant to be a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Even with the delays and changes to what the game was originally meant to be, Arc Raiders is shaping up to be a game to watch out for. Embark Studios has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it can make a game with legs, even in an overcrowded shooter space, with its success with The Finals.</p>
<p>There's no reason to think it couldn't do the same with Arc Raiders, even after what many would consider to be signs of the game having a troubled development. If you're keen on checking out Arc Raiders, there's still time to sign up and potentially be selected for Wednesday's playtest through the game's <a href="https://arcraiders.com/">official website</a>.</p>
