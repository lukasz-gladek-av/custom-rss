            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed the previous Battlefield 6 leaks for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10 with no early access options.</p>



<p>On PC, the pricing is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: $69.99 / €69.99 / GBP 59.99
<ul>
<li>Phantom Edition: $99.99 / €99.99 / GBP 89.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>On consoles, it is slightly higher for Europeans and British players:</p>



<ul>
<li>$69.99 / €79.99 / GBP 69.99
<ul>
<li>$99.99 / €109.99/ GBP 99.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The Open Beta details are slightly different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a>, though. There will be two beta weekends:</p>



<ul>
<li>Saturday, August 9 - Sunday, August 10</li>



<li>Thursday, August 14 - Sunday, August 17</li>
</ul>



<p>The press release also reveals plenty of details on Battlefield 6. The premise is that in 2027, a high-profile assassination throws the world into chaos. Around the same time, 'major European countries' leave NATO, while the United States and its remaining NATO allies are left to deal with a massive private military corporation called PAX ARMATA.</p>

<p>In the single player campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by Motive</a>, players step into the boots of Dagger 1-3, a squad of Marine Raiders fighting private military companies around the world to stop a global collapse. The developers promise 'jaw-dropping set pieces' and 'explosive action on an unparalleled scale'.</p>



<p>The game's combat system is described as 'kinesthetic', enhancing gunplay and character movement. It offers new tactical options, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drag and Revive - Lets you drag a teammate away from danger while reviving them</li>



<li>Peek and Lean - Lets you peek around corners to spy on the enemies while remaining unexposed to their fire</li>



<li>Combat rolls - A new maneuvering ability to limit fall damage and increase the chance to avoid getting hit</li>



<li>Mounting weapons - When behind cover, players can mount weapons to decrease recoil</li>



<li>Hitch ride - This feature expands how many players can be on vehicles beyond just seats</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers also promise that Battlefield 6 will offer 'reliable recoil patterns' and 'well-defined weapon ranges'. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The class system returns. That was practically a guarantee - even Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it back eventually</a>, although it was too little and too late. The classes are the same four fans have loved throughout the entire franchise: Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Support.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Assault class, unsurprisingly, uses assault rifles and has a faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from the weapons. It also takes less damage and a lower movement speed penalty from a fall. Its signature gadget is an Adrenaline Injector that clears flash and stun effects (and offers resistance against them), boosts sprint speed, reduces damage taken from explosives, and makes the sound of enemy footsteps clearer. Its active ability reveals audible nearby foes, and kills prolong this effect. Assault players can choose from two training options: a Grenadier (quicker reload on grenade launchers, extra grenades, and more resistance against flash effects) or a Frontliner (improved health regeneration, extra adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty to shooting on the move).</li>



<li>The Engineer uses submachine guns, has better hip-fire control, and takes reduced damage from explosives. Its gadget is the Repair Tool, which 'fixes friendly assets and armor' but can also damage enemy assets. Its active ability overloads the Repair Tool to improve its efficiency. The Engineer's training options are the Anti-Armor (who focuses on damaging enemy vehicles with faster loads, extra rockets, and its rockets diminish repair efficiency) and the Combat Engineer (who automatically regenerates the health of vehicles they occupy, can use the Repair Tool longer, and automatically spots mines).</li>



<li>The Recon uses sniper rifles, with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control. It can automatically spot enemies when aiming through an optic sight. Its gadget is the Motion Sensor that tracks any enemy movement in its range. Its active ability calls an UAV to passively spot enemies in a marked position. The Recon's training options are: Sniper (improved auto-spot speed, range, duration, and the sniper shots temporarily prevent healing and headshots make targets unrevivable) and Pathfinder (undetectable by equipment except when sprinting, they also highlight foes for the rest of the squad and can perform quieter takedowns).</li>



<li>Lastly, the Support fights with light machine guns and does not suffer any sprint speed penalty with this weapon. They can drag and revive squadmates faster and also carry a Supply Bag, which heals allies and resupplies both weapon and gadget ammunition. Their active ability is a supply area of effect around them that also temporarily increases their revive speed. The Support's Training Options are: Combat Medic (they function as a health dispensary for squadmates and regenerate health when reviving them) and Fire Support (they have improved weapon control from mounted weapons and can provide ammo to teammates).</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 also brings tactical destruction back. Players can not only use rockets or tanks to blow things off, as even a sledgehammer or some C4 can take down a wall. The developers say that projectiles now leave a realistic impact based on the round and the wall's material, while explosives blow down walls based on their damage potential.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The game will launch with nine maps: Siege of Cairo, Empire State, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, Kundara Valley, and the remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. Multiplayer modes include classics like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, not to mention shooter staples like Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. The developers also added a brand new mode called Escalation where two teams fight to capture strategic control points.</p>



<p>Portal also returns with a robust toolset that has been improved with a spatial editor powered by Godot. A server browser will be a 'highlighted Community option' that is often available in Featured playlists. Furthermore, Portal-made experiences created in Verified Mode will allow for full progression in Battlefield 6. Lastly, the developers reassured fans that the ambitious post-launch support will deliver more maps, modes, weapons, and features on a regular basis. </p>

			<p>Hangar 13 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/523098355357712525?l=english">announced</a> the PC specs for <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country,</a> and unfortunately for anyone with a PC on the lower end of the hardware spectrum, you won't be playing this game at launch if you don't upgrade your hardware or buy a console.</p>



<p>Starting with the features PC players can enjoy if they have the hardware for it, Mafia: The Old Country will feature an uncapped framerate during gameplay, though the framerate will be capped to 30 FPS during cutscenes. Unreal Temporal Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX<em>™</em> Super Resolution 4, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling 4, and Intel Xe Super Sampling 2 will all be supported at launch, including V-Sync and frame generation for those with the hardware for the features. It'll also have HDR and ultrawide monitor support at launch.</p>



<p>And you'll seemingly need all the upscaling help you can get, as it's an extremely demanding game that seems to require more from your CPU than GPU, given the fact that even the minimum CPU requirements ask that you have an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X or Intel Core i7-9700K in your machine to play the game at 1920x1080p, with graphical settings at 'Medium.' As for the minimum GPU requirement, you'll either need an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT or NVIDIA RTX 2070 to have a smooth experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country PC Specs. Image credit: Hangar 13</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you dared to play the game at the 'High' graphical preset at 2560x1440p, then you'd better have an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Intel Core i7-12700K CPU ready to go, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT or NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU.</p>



<p>Finally, playing the game with the graphical settings on 'Epic,' aiming for a 4K resolution, you'll need an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X or Intel Core i7-14700K CPU, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 or NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti.</p>



<p>With all that said, even those with lower-spec hardware might be able to squeeze out some semblance of a good experience by tweaking the graphical settings to fit their build. Here are all the settings you can tweak at launch: </p>



<ul>
<li>Display Selection: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>Screen Mode: Windowed, Borderless Fullscreen</li>



<li>Window Resolution: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>V-Sync: Off, On (supports VRR via G-Sync / FreeSync)</li>



<li>Gameplay Frame Rate (FPS): 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 144, Unlimited</li>



<li>Quality Preset: Low, Medium, High, Epic, Custom</li>



<li>Anti-Aliasing &amp; Upscaling: Unreal TSR, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS</li>



<li>Upscaling Mode: Performance - High, Performance, Balanced, Quality, Quality - High, Native</li>



<li>Sharpness:&nbsp; 0.1 - 1.0 (in increments of .1)</li>



<li>Frame Generation: Off, On (on supported hardware)</li>



<li>Global Illumination: High, Epic</li>



<li>Shadows: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Reflections: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>View Distance: Near, Medium, Far, Epic</li>



<li>Textures: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Foliage: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Effects: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Post Processing: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Motion Blur: Off, On</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, when Mafia: The Old Country launches next week on August 8, 2025, it won't arrive with a slew of other technical issues that impair it from running well on the builds that it should run on without issue. We'll see how things go when it hits PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next week.</p>
