			<p>An image has appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">Reddit</a> that includes a statement explaining that PayPal is no longer processing Steam purchases in currencies other than the following six: Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or United States Dollars.</p>



<p>The image shows an answer from Steam Support as to why using PayPal in the user's current currency (which is presumably not one of the above six) is unavailable. "<em>In early July 2025</em>," the statement reads, "<em>PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future,</em>" the statement continues, "<em>but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this</em>." The statement then concludes by suggesting the user try a different payment method, including adding funds to their Steam wallet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the first official statement from Valve on the issue, though players have been complaining about the problems on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/595154293314559955/">Steam forums since early July</a>, which lines up with the timeline shared by Valve. One user who commented on the forum linked above claims to have made a purchase on Steam through PayPal, not in one of the aforementioned six currencies just three days prior to July 12, 2025. So we at least have some idea as to when this began.</p>



<p>It's unclear as to why PayPal's acquiring banks are blocking any purchases on Valve's platform not in one of six currencies, but the timeline of everything has many speculating that it has something to do with the current issues around <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/">payment processors seemingly putting pressure on Valve to remove certain kinds of games from its platform</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the timing, there's no concrete connection between PayPal's affiliated banks no longer processing purchases on Steam due to the campaign to have certain kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-have-confidence-in-age-rating-systems/">adult and NSFW content removed from videogame platforms like Steam and Itch.io</a>. </p>

			<p>KRAFTON, owner of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, has responded to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders, doubling-down on allegations that co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio, and that their absence had been impacting the development team for Subnautica 2 as far back as July 2023.</p>



<p>Backing up slightly, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, each co-founder of Unknown Worlds and together creators of the original Subnautica, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">sued their former employer, KRAFTON</a>, after KRAFTON fired all three of them and delayed Subnautica 2 from its initial 2025 release window into 2026. There's a whole whack of <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">events that led up to that lawsuit you can check out in a bullet-point list, here.</a></p>



<p>A key element that KRAFTON has pushed since the public dispute between Cleveland, McGuire, Gill, and KRAFTON began is KRAFTON's allegation that the co-founders<em> </em>weren't actually working on Subnautica 2 at all, and in the company's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">response filing published August 12, 2025</a>, KRAFTON tries to drill that point home even further.</p>



<p>KRAFTON claims that once it had successfully acquired Unknown Worlds, Cleveland and McGuire took their earnings from the sale and "<em>quickly lost interest in developing Subnautica 2</em>," the filing reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide game director and technical director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game</em>."</p>



<p>The filing continues to allege that Cleveland in particular had left his videogame development career to pursue filmmaking, another point that KRAFTON has brought up before.</p>



<p>KRAFTON goes on to allege that two months prior to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill claiming the game was ready for an early access launch, the development lead on Subnautica 2 said the first stage of early access for the game would be "<em>about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope</em>," and that the lead joked the game "<em>would be in development for 30 years</em>" at the current pace it was going earlier this year.</p>



<p>To further its point about Cleveland and McGuire leaving their posts, KRAFTON claims the two co-founders declined to return to their roles as game director and technical director, and that Gill had even stated "<em>there's no coming back to a job they didn't have</em>." Following that, KRAFTON includes a statement allegedly from Cleveland, in which Cleveland admits that Subnautica 2's development began with the intention of having a younger generation of development talent at Unknown Worlds take the helm for the sequel, and that he knew that he "<em>wasn't going to be running that team</em>" from the beginning.</p>



<p>All of this will be worked out in the courts over the course of the coming months, potentially even years, and right now the dispute can be boiled down to both sides flinging claims at the other that we can't yet know to be totally true. </p>



<p>Whichever way it goes, it'll be interesting to see how this dispute ends, and which of the claims being flung end up sticking.</p>
