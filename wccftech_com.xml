			<p>Earlier this month, IO Interactive made more than a few brows rise when it shared <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-unveils-partnership-with-nvidia-official-pc-system-requirements/">the minimum and recommended PC specifications</a></strong> for the highly anticipated <strong><em>007 First Light</em></strong>. The <strong>32GB of RAM recommended for 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second gameplay</strong> was particularly concerning, suggesting potential optimization issues that may have made the game run poorly on many system configurations.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">you won't have to empty your wallet to purchase more RAM</strong> during the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">current memory crisis</a></strong> to run 007 First Light decently at 1080p resolution,</p>



<p><em>"We are providing today an update to the PC system requirements for 007 First Light after the community flagged some inconsistencies in an earlier version of the listing,"</em> the developer wrote on the game's <strong><a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official X profile.</a></strong></p>



<p><em>"After a thorough re-examination and additional testing, <strong>the recommended RAM has been corrected from 32GB to 16GB, VRAM values have been updated, and the minimum CPU line has been fixed</strong>. Additional performance targets will be shared closer to launch,"</em> the developer continued, confirming that the updated specs are now reflected across store pages.</p>

			<p>Much has been said about the underwhelming <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> PC performance ever since <strong>CAPCOM</strong> launched the game nearly a year ago.</p>



<p>Mere days after the release, renowned modder <strong>Praydog</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new version of his <strong>REFramework</strong></a> to improve certain stuttering instances caused by the game's anti-tampering technology. In April 2025, a texture decompressor tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tool-improves-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released</a> to minimize the stuttering caused by the real-time in-game decompression process.</p>



<p>The developer also worked to improve the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance. One step was the addition of <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> and <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong> support, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were introduced with <strong>Title Update 2</strong> in late June</a>. However, that wasn't nearly enough, and a few days later, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to cancel</a> a technical lecture it was scheduled to hold at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 (<strong>CEDEC</strong>) event in Japan due to harassment from players.</p>



<p>The recent <strong>Title Update 4</strong> introduced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over a hundred additional performance improvements</a></strong>, which finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to address most of the remaining critical issues</a>. Still, there was at least one big issue left: the game <strong>apparently constantly checks whether you own every piece of released DLC, and for each DLC that you do not own, the performance gets worse</strong>.</p>



<p>Reddit User De Tylmarande, who already spotted a fairly similar oversight in CAPCOM's Dragon's Dogma 2 that the developer later patched, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered this phenomenon</a> through testing two Steam accounts on identical hardware:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Account 1:</strong> Base game only with severe FPS drops (20-25 FPS in hubs)</li>



<li><strong>Account 2:</strong> All DLC installed with smooth performance (80+ FPS)</li>
</ul>



<p>Every variable was controlled (character appearance, location, time of day, graphics settings, drivers). The only difference was DLC ownership, and the issue was consistently replicated. Switching between accounts consistently replicated the issue. De Tylmarande then created a small "mod" that <strong>tricked the game into recognizing all DLC as owned (without actually unlocking anything)</strong>, and the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance <strong>skyrocketed immediately</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MH Wilds DLC Presence Check Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uf5cICpDXX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, it is a bit baffling that a modder had to discover this nearly a full year after a game (and a triple-A one, no less) had launched. De Tylmarande added that <strong>Digital Foundry</strong> had reached out and would conduct their own analysis, so we can likely expect more insights soon. However, the video above already appears convincing enough.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> launched a new digital storefront called '<strong><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cfx Marketplace</a></strong>'. This is a modding store where <strong>FiveM</strong> and <strong>RedM</strong> creators can sell their mods for the modding frameworks created for <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>, respectively. The announcement post lists the creators who have already signed up to be a part of Cfx Marketplace:</p>



<h2 id="h-launch-creators">Launch Creators</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Ambitioneers</li>



<li>Blue's Syn Scripts</li>



<li>BrunX Mods</li>



<li>Codesign</li>



<li>DirkScripts</li>



<li>Electus Scripts</li>

<li>LB Phone</li>



<li>Tiger Scripts</li>



<li>NoPixel</li>



<li>Wasabi Scripts</li>



<li>Pickle Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>It's yet another sign that Rockstar is indeed pushing hard toward user-generated content and perhaps will do that even more in the upcoming <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per an earlier report</a>. As a reminder, the studio acquired <strong>Cfx.re</strong>, the team behind both FiveM and RedM, <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in August 2023</a>.</p>



<p>One of the mods available on the Cfx Marketplace is a server-side version of the stunning graphics overhaul, <strong>NaturalVision</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-natural-vision-enhanced-mod-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we've often featured as it evolved over time</a>. With the <strong><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7217721-naturalvision-fivem-server-graphics-pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaturalVision Graphics Pack</a></strong>, FiveM server owners can get a visual mod that works for everyone on the server, transforming weather, lighting, ambient colors, tonemapping, and more. The pack is priced at $12.19/month.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the Marketplace also includes filters for mods that enhance the single player versions of Grand Theft Auto V or Red Dead Redemption 2. There are no such mods available at the moment, but the mere existence of these filters suggests that Rockstar and the Cfx team believe they will be added over time by creators.</p>



<p>For the record, the most expensive item currently available on the Cfx Marketplace is the <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7221601-mrpd-hospital-mechanic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>MRPD/HOSPITAL/MECHANIC</strong> bundle</a>, which includes full maps for the Mission Row Police Department, a Hospital, and a Mechanic. The bundle is priced at $201.29.</p>
