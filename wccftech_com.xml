			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">announced</a> a new update coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro users who have opted into the PS5 Beta program, meant to make pairing your DualSense controller to multiple devices at a time a "<em>seamless</em>" process. The update, which is being pushed tomorrow for users in the beta program, will let you switch from using your DualSense controller wirelessly on one device to another, without having to re-pair it every time.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Blog post describes a process through which after you've initially paired your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller with your PS5, PC, and mobile device, through a combination of pressing the PS button and one of the face buttons, you can switch between devices.</p>



<p>"<em>With this update, you can now register up to four devices simultaneously, and easily switch between them directly from your controller,</em>" writes Shuzo Kikuchi, vice president of product management at Sony. "<em>For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Once you've properly paired your controller to a device the first time, going through the prescribed button presses in the example chart below should let you switch from one device to another, without skipping a beat. </p>



<p>Note that this chart doesn't mean you'll need to set up device switching in this exact way, it is just an example of how you can have up to four devices paired to one controller and switch between them.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Slot Number</strong></td><td><strong>Button Used</strong></td><td><strong>Player Indicator Lights</strong></td><td><strong>Connected Device</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Slot 1</td><td>PS button and Triangle button</td><td>One light on</td><td>PS5</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 2</td><td>PS button and Circle button</td><td>Two lights on</td><td>PS5 Pro</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 3</td><td>PS button and Cross button</td><td>Three lights on</td><td>Windows PC</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 4</td><td>PS button and Square button</td><td>Four lights on</td><td>iPhone</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The other key element of the blog post announcing this update is a feature that won't be in tomorrow's update but will be in a future one. A power-saving mode is coming down the pipeline, which will reduce the amount of power your console is pulling while playing games that support the feature. </p>



<p>Meaning that if you're playing, say, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and it supports this power saving feature, then with the feature enabled, your PS5/PS5 Pro device will draw less power to run the game. This will result in performance being scaled back, and it also disables features like VR support for games that have a VR mode. The intent of the mode is to reduce the environmental footprint caused by running your PS5/PS5 Pro at full power whenever you're using it.</p>



<p>If you're a player who cares about having a smooth framerate and/or being able to play with graphical features like ray-tracing, then it's doubtful you'll ever use a mode like this. But for games that don't require that much power to run them at a smooth framerate, and ones that don't even have higher-fidelity options in terms of graphics, like most pixel-art games, it's a solid option to reduce the environmental impact, and perhaps even your own electricity bill. </p>



<p>For now though, we're still waiting to see how many games will even support the feature, and the specifics around how it'll work. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Less than a week after we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-series-julian-lefay-is-leaving-the-industry-due-to-terminal-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that original Elder Scrolls creator Julian LeFay had left the industry due to a terminal illness, developer OnceLost Games, the last studio he worked at, <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1947867062216626313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he passed away yesterday evening.</p>



<p>LeFay, born in Denmark, was 59 years old at the time of his passing. He joined Bethesda at just 22, shortly after that company's foundation, and became known for spearheading the creation of the Elder Scrolls franchise. He is credited as a programmer on Arena, a director and designer on Daggerfall, and a designer on the spin-off Battlespire. He also contributed in a minor way to Morrowind as a contractor before leaving Bethesda in 1998.</p>



<p>In 2019, Julian LeFay co-founded OnceLost Games alongside fellow Elder Scrolls creators Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman to create The Wayward Realms. The game's first teaser trailer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/open-world-fantasy-rpg-the-wayward-realms-briefly-showcased-made-by-ex-elder-scrolls-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> in August 2021. The Wayward Realms was deliberately inspired by the second Elder Scrolls game, Daggerfall. LeFay hoped to bring back that game's feeling of a truly massive world in an even better fashion thanks to the advancements made in procedural generation. We talked about that with OnceLost Games in an interview <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published last year</a>.</p>



<p>In their public message, the developers of The Wayward Realms said that LeFay kept working on the game until very recently, and they expressed the desire to fulfill his vision by releasing The Wayward Realms.</p>



<p><em>Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms. Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all.</em></p>



<p><em>We understand that our community will likely have many questions about how Julian's passing will affect The Wayward Realms' development. We want to be transparent with you. This is an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry. However, Julian's vision for The Wayward Realms is deeply embedded in every aspect of our development process. His technical frameworks, design philosophies, and direction have been carefully documented and shared with our team. We are not just continuing his work- we are honoring it by ensuring that his vision becomes the reality he dreamed of.</em></p>



<p><em>We are more committed than ever to bringing The Wayward Realms to life exactly as Julian envisioned it. Our development continues with the same passion, technical excellence, and attention to detail that Julian demanded. Every feature, every system, and every player experience will aim to reflect his dedication to creating "The Grand RPG" that redefines what the genre can be. Ted Peterson, Eric Heberling, and our entire development team remain fully dedicated to this mission. We will continue to share development updates, maintain our transparency with the community, and ensure that The Wayward Realms becomes the groundbreaking experience Julian knew it could be.</em></p>



<p>The Wayward Realms was funded with over $800K <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Kickstarter</a>. You can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1685310/The_Wayward_Realms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Wccftech wishes to express the staff's heartfelt condolences to Julian's family and friends.</p>
