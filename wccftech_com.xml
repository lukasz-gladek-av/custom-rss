			<p>When Bethesda revealed and surprise-dropped The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, it was a cause of concern for at least two other game studios. One was Sandfall Interactive, which was understandably concerned about their debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, being overshadowed by the Oblivion Remaster. The other, as we now know from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-inside-story-of-how-oblivion-remastered-caused-immense-worry-then-sublime-relief-for-the-industrious-devs-behind-mod-megaproject-skyblivion">a new mini-documentary courtesy of Eurogamer</a>, was, even more understandably, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">the Skyblivion mod development team</a>.</p>



<p>And in both cases, the concern quickly faded to relief. In the case of Sandfall Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">the word-of-mouth around both games that week actually helped Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 commercially</a>. For Skyblivion, which is still in the works, it was a different kind of relief, the relief of knowing that Bethesda wasn't doing something that would actually get in their way.</p>

<p>"<em>It was not set in stone whether it was a 'remake' or a 'remaster,' so we were concerned,</em>" said Dee Keyes, former world designer on Skyblivion and member of the development team. "<em>It was a huge relief because we realized, 'Oh, they're doing something completely different.</em>' <em>They're doing a faithful remaster, and we were going for something more remade from the ground up</em>."</p>



<p>Since the release of Oblivion Remastered, Bethesda has shown the Skyblivion team plenty of love and appreciation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">not only giving each of them codes for Oblivion Remastered</a> when it released, but later <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/">inviting the team to Bethesda's headquarters in Rockville</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/">confirmed that it is in the "<em>final stretch</em>" on the mod's development</a>, and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-first-15-minutes-shared-new-video/">shared the first 15 minutes of gameplay</a> that players will get to experience when the mod is finally ready and in their hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, following the accidental source code leak of AMD FSR 4 INT8 files, modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-amd-fsr-4-int8-files-helps-users-turn-on-fsr-4-on-rx-7000-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to get a version of AMD FSR4 working on non-RDNA 4 GPUs</a> (the Radeon RX 9000 Series that launched earlier this year). The regular version of the latest AMD upscaler runs on FP8, that is, the 8-bit Floating-Point format, which is not supported by prior RDNA GPUs. However, this leaked version running on INT8 is compatible with a much wider range of hardware, since support for the 8-bit Integer Fixed-Point format is included in most modern GPUs. </p>



<p>Of course, there's a reason why AMD chose the FP8 format for the public release: it allows for a wider dynamic range than INT8, doing a better job in preserving model accuracy and stability. Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqDWJCW06Ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has now tested this version</a> on several non-RDNA4 hardware to see how well it works in terms of both performance and quality.</p>



<p>First of all, he compared the quality of AMD FSR 4 FP8 and AMD FSR 4 INT8, the first running on RDNA 4 hardware and the leaked version running on RDNA 3 and RDNA 2 hardware. The result is obvious: the INT8 version introduces aliasing and temporal artifacts. These visual issues are even more pronounced on the latest Adrenalin driver (25.9.1), likely due to some bug, so if you're going to try running the INT8 version, reverting to driver 23.9.1 is advisable.</p>



<p>That said, AMD FSR 4 INT8 does still provide superior upscaling quality compared to AMD FSR 3. The problem is that it's also a lot slower. Now, the PlayStation 5 consoles do not support INT8, but the Xbox Series X does, having access to the full RDNA 2 feature set. For a simulation of how Microsoft's console could run this version of the upscaler, Digital Foundry used an RX 6700 GPU running the Horizon Forbidden West benchmark. </p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 INT8 is by far the slowest upscaler compared to AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS, providing only a 28% performance uplift when set in Performance mode compared to 4K native resolution. XeSS Balance mode is 15% faster, while FSR 3 Performance mode is 29% faster. However, in another benchmark scene from Alan Wake 2, DF tested Xbox Series X-like settings at 1440p with FSR 4 set to Performance mode and FSR 2 to Balance mode. In this comparison, FSR 4 Performance mode slightly beats FSR 2 Balance mode in frame rate (by around 4%) and, more importantly, it provides a cleaner image despite reconstructing from a lower base resolution. </p>

<iframe title="Leaked FSR4 INT8 Test: RDNA 3, RDNA 2, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Nvidia + Xbox Series X Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqDWJCW06Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Therefore, it could potentially benefit the Xbox Series X in certain scenarios. However, most multiplatform games are unlikely to take advantage of this since the base PS5 console cannot run AMD FSR 4 INT8. </p>



<p>The video analysis also includes a look at how this version performs on Steam Deck, though that scenario was already tested by other YouTubers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing significant image quality improvements</a> but also a heavy performance cost in games like Cyberpunk 2077. Notably, this might not be the final version of AMD FSR 4 INT8, and Digital Foundry got a teasing statement from AMD on that note:</p>



<p><em>We look forward to more updates to FSR4 this Fall that will continue to improve gamers' experiences.</em></p>



<p>It's not quite a confirmation, but this version of FSR 4 may receive some performance improvements that would make it more viable for RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 hardware. </p>
