			<p>Data mining may have leaked the Nintendo Switch 2's computing power in teraflops. <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3950#post-1544590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Famiboards user Zachy</a>, the undocked or handheld mode will have a GPU clock speed of 561 MHz, translating into 1.71 TFLOPS. In docked mode, the GPU clock speed nearly doubles at 1000 Mhz, translating to around 3.1 TFLOPS.</p>
<p>That's one-fourth of the 12 TFLOPS of the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which launched in 2021. However, the RTX 3060 is a desktop GPU, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A better comparison is Microsoft's Xbox Series S console. It has been said that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and indeed, the leaked TFLOPS data supports that theory since the Series S has 4 TFLOPS of computing power. That's not a big difference, though, and third-party game developers will undoubtedly use their Xbox Series S configurations as starting targets for their ports to the new Nintendo console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra 239 SoC&nbsp;</a>(featuring an eight-core CPU and an Ampere-based GPU with 2048 CUDA cores), does have an advantage over the Xbox Series S: its reported native support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction technology. While the latter may not prove to be very useful as developers wouldn't want to spend the meager GPU power on ray tracing effects, DLSS SR will indeed be invaluable to uplift the performance to acceptable standards.</p>
<p>New leaks and rumors about the new Nintendo console pop up nearly daily at this point. The Japanese game developer and console manufacturer has promised it will unveil the hardware (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to include backward compatibility with existing Switch games, providing immediate access to a very large library) before the end of March, which is when Nintendo's fiscal year ends.</p>
