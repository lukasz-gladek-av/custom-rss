			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available on PC, introducing plenty of new features that are sure to breathe new life into the latest main entry in the series.</p>
<p>The new version of the game includes, as announced a few days back, new features such as new ray tracing settings like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, that push the game's visuals beyond those offered in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times with DirectStorage support and more. Now that the upgrade is out, we have also learned that all settings can go as high as Ultra and that the game features a Scene BVH Quality, thanks to a new screenshot provided by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/gabdeg.8633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gabdeg</a> on the ResetERA forums. Unfortunately, HDR support is nowhere to be found, which is a shame.</p>

<p>It's too early to say if the new ray tracing features included in the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced PC release improve the game's visuals universally, but from the <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick comparison</a> put together by gabdeg, it's clear they do have a significant impact. Another <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparison</a> put together by another ResetERA forums member, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/vic20.61250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vic20</a>, highlights how much ray-traced global illumination makes a difference. Performance also seems to be solid, according to the first few reports, so it definitely looks like Rockstar Games has done a great job improving their highly successful game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available for all PC users as a free upgrade, while the Legacy version will continue to be available to allow those with PC configurations that do not match those for the upgraded version of the game to continue playing normally.

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is all about crafting the best gear to perfect your build and allow you to take on some of the game's strongest monsters and in your quest for power, there will come a time when you will need more than just monster parts to craft the strongest gear. Among these items are the Hunter Symbols, which are awarded to the best hunters after completing certain quests.</p>
<p>The Hunter Symbols in Monster Hunter Wilds come in three different number variants and are awarded after completing quests involving <strong>Tempered Monsters</strong>. These monster variants, which are considerably more powerful than the base ones, will start roaming maps after you defeat them in post-game story quests, starting with the <strong>Main Mission 4.3: Wyvern Spark and Rose Thorns</strong> quest. To get <strong>Hunter Symbol I</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 5-Star Tempered monsters, while to get <strong>Hunter Symbol II</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 6-Star Tempered monsters.</p>

<p>To get <strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong> in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will have to <strong>complete quests involving 7 and 8-Star Tempered monsters</strong>, which are Rey Dau, Jin Dahaad, Uth Duna, Nu Udra,&nbsp; and Gore Magala for 7-Star rank, and Arkveld for 8-Star rank. Before you can actually encounter the Tempered variants of the Apex predators above, however, you will first have to complete the final story mission, <strong>Mission 6-1</strong>, and reach <strong>Hunter Rank 41</strong>. Be sure to gear up before you attempt to fight these Tempered monsters, as they are the current strongest monsters in the game!</p>

			<p>The Suikoden series revival will not stop with the HD remasters of the first two entries in the series launching this week, as revealed during a livestream that aired a few hours ago.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/TIjGwGAJJ4s?si=sIKc_fHQknKkO5CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live broadcast</a>, Konami confirmed that the series will continue with a new mobile game called Suikoden STAR LEAP. Set between the fifth and first entry in the series, the game will feature a story that is part of the canon of the series, beautiful 2D graphics inspired by the first two entries in the series, returning characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa, many of the gameplay features that define the series, such as the ability to recruit 108 characters and more. While it will be a gacha game, it has been confirmed that the 108 Stars of Destiny can all be obtained without pulls, and only legacy characters will be obtainable with the typical gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>While Suikoden STAR LEAP will offer fans of the series the chance to experience a new story set in the series' universe, the aforementioned animated show, on the other hand, is clearly meant to expand the series' reach beyond its existing fanbase. In the works by Konami's animation studio and NBC Universal Entertainment Japan, the animated show will introduce new fans to the deep lore of Suikoden II. Hopefully, it will not shy away from showing some of the original game's most chilling sequences, which all involve one of the game's main villains, the iconic Luca Blight.</p>
<p>The Suikoden Live livestream also featured new information on merchandise, which will mostly be released only in Japan, orchestral performances of the series' iconic music, and more. You can check the full livestream below.</p>

<p>This week is going to be a great one for fans of the series, as the Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remasters: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars finally launch on PCs and consoles worldwide on <a href="https://wccftech.com/suidkoen-i-ii-remaster-release-date/">March 6th</a>. The collection includes the first two entries in the series, complete with plenty of enhancements, including visual improvements and new quality-of-life features.</p>
