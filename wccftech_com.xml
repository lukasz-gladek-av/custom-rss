			<p>The Witcher 4 development team aims to take full advantage of the generational shift since the release of The Witcher 3, and their ambition to deliver a true next-gen experience had to be shown right from the get-go with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> shown during this year's edition of Unreal Fest.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-devs-are-preparing-for-a-generational-shift-after-the-witcher-3-and-theyre-studying-the-rpgs-biggest-city-to-help/">GamesRadar+</a>, Engineering Production Manager Jan Hermanowicz said that the studio is adapting to the generational shift in hardware, engines, and technology since the release of the third entry in the series. The studio wants to take full advantage of this shift to deliver a true next-generation experience.</p>
<p>This ambition had to be shown right away, which led to the showing of the village of Valdrest in The Witcher 4 tech demo. This village featured over 300 NPCs, a huge character density comparable to The Witcher 3's biggest city, Novigrad, which provided clear proof of how serious CDPR is about stepping up from the previous entry in the series. The city players get to explore as Geralt is searching for Ciri actually served as a basis for the creation of Valdrest's NPC density, according to Hermanowicz, as the team spent a lot of time looking at recordings of Novigrad, looking at what was done in the past, what worked and what couldn't be accomplished at the time. As such, the studio is definitely not stepping into upping the ante blindly, but is actually building on what was already done in the past.</p>
<p>Though just a tech demo that may not be entirely representative of the final game, The Witcher 4's first showing was indeed impressive, and not just for how alive the village of Valdrest looked. The tech demo was running on base PlayStation 4 at 60 FPS with ray tracing, and with the studio making the game with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a>, there's no doubt that we won't see a repeat of what happened with Cyberpunk 2077's console launch, although Xbox Series S owners may not be able to enjoy the game as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners, as getting the game to run at 60 FPS on the system will be extremely challenging.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 packs significant CPU and GPU performance improvements over version 5.4 of the engine, boding well for future games powered by the Epic engine.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> on YouTube puts the Paris Tech Demo by Scans Factory running on an RTX 5080 in Unreal Engine 5.6 and Unreal Engine 5.4 at default settings and with hardware Lumen in GPU and CPU limited scenarios side-by-side, highlighting how there are significant performance improvements in the new version of the engine in both scenarios. GPU performance is estimated to be improved by up to 25%, with the new version of the engine utilizing GPU resources better, resulting in a higher power draw as well. CPU performance, on the other hand, sees the biggest improvement in the new version of the engine, up to 35%, with more stable frametimes as well. Even in terms of image quality, Unreal Engine 5.6 brings significant improvements with more accurate Lumen lighting and higher quality Lumen reflections.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 launched earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">this month</a>, right after the annual Unreal Fest opening presentation revealed some of its central features and improvements over the previous version of the engine. Among the improvements are hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, and more. The launch of the new version of the engine accompanied the first public showing of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Wìtcher IV tech demo</a>, which served as a showcase of the features of the new version of the engine.</p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.6 can be found on its official website.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch was on the back foot in terms of hardware power from day one. The game’s big launch title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, felt like it <em>just barely</em> fit within the confines of the system, running at an inconsistent 30fps and a less-than-optimal pixel count. Six years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> pushed the Switch even closer to its limits (and arguably beyond).</p>
<p>Given the struggles the games had on the OG Switch, it feels appropriate that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more technically-adept Switch 2</a> is launching with updated versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which promise sharper visuals, better performance, and more. So, do these upgrades truly transform these Switch-era epics? Or are they less than legendary? Venture forth for my thoughts...</p>
<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The original Switch versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom certainly delivered in terms of style, mood, and sense of scale, but you usually weren’t rewarded for examining anything too closely, with an unflattering combination of soft details and jagged edges affecting many environments and objects.</p>
<p>The new versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom sharpen things up considerably, bumping the resolution to a native 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld mode. That resolution is likely somewhat dynamic, but to my eye, it looked to occupy the higher end of the scale most of the time. Combined with HDR, the resolution bump results in an overall more vibrant, engaging presentation. Individual blades of grass can now be seen and environmental details are no longer lost in a sea of bleary textures and jagged edges. That said, I’d be lying if I said the difference is completely transformational. Underlying assets haven’t really changed, they’re just rendered at a more appealing resolution. The visual update is nice, but I can’t say it completely bowled me over.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>More significant, is the boost in performance. On the OG Switch, you only got a shaky 30fps which could drop as low as 20fps (particularly in TotK) but on Switch 2, you’re looking at a rock-solid 60fps. Even delving into TotK’s most problematic areas, like the Fire Temple, didn’t result in any particularly noticeable hiccups, and I have to say, it felt damn good to finally wander around Kakariko Village without any chug.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the thing that impressed me most about the Switch 2 versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom was something I wasn’t expecting – Zelda Notes. If you download the Switch 2 updates you can now pair with a mobile app that provides the player with on-the-fly guidance and other handy-dandy features. Honestly, I’m not really a big phone guy – I own one, but I don’t do much with it, only downloading the apps I absolutely need. The idea of playing Zelda with my phone on my lap didn’t sound particularly appealing and Nintendo’s history when it comes to these kinds of mobile companion apps wasn’t terribly encouraging. Consider my surprise when I actually found the app quite useful!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The core feature of Zelda Notes is an interactive map, which syncs with your Switch 2, tracks your current coordinates, and allows you to mark the location of pretty much anything you want, whether you’ve found that thing previously or not – landmarks, key items, crafting materials, enemies, whatever. The map even provides GPS-like directions to marked destinations. Of course, discovering things for yourself is part of the fun in Zelda games, but for someone like me who’s already sunk many hours into beating BotW and TotK, but still far from 100 percent completion due to a lack of time and patience for searching out every trinket, Zelda Notes is kind of a godsend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For example, I’ve wanted to acquire the “Depths Armor” set in TotK for some time, as it gives you some immunity to the game’s annoying Gloom, but getting it requires the player to locate a series of difficult-to-find “Bargainer Statues” in the game’s murky underworld. I’d pretty much given up the task, but Zelda Notes allowed me to easily locate the Bargainer Statues using the map and in around 90 minutes I finally had my Depths Armor set, something that previously would have required countless, possibly fruitless, hours searching in-game or through poorly-written online guides.</p>
<p>Zelda Notes also offers other features, including the ability to save and share Autobuild creations and items, “Voice Memories” that provide new insights about the world from Zelda and other characters, and yes, even the limited ability to fix broken weapons! Zelda Notes feels like an promising template for the future, and I’d like to see other Nintendo games, particularly those with lots of secrets, get similar guides.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch24.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Come for the Polish, Stay for the Pro-Tips</strong></h2>
<p>The Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom offer a nice visual spit-shine and performance boost, although I’m not sure what you get is more impressive than some of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVmerPY3obzj00atuU_9x4IiHZhiPYF2w257wTmfUao3XQL78E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates Nintendo is offering</a> for other Switch 1 games. In my opinion, what really justifies the BotW and TotK updates being paid products is Zelda Notes, which is a surprisingly useful and technically-savvy tool. Of course, not everyone will be interested in something like Zelda Notes, but if you’re looking for a bit of guidance, this is an upgrade path worth exploring, adventurer.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates are available now for $10 apiece or for “free” with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>

			<p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of an expanded partnership with AMD to make next-generation devices, AMD CEO Lisa Su also posted her own statement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a brief video message</a>:</p>
<p><em>AMD and Microsoft are advancing a bold, shared vision for the future of gaming one that enables seamless gameplay across any screen, placing gamers at the center of the experience anywhere. We're so excited to be deepening our relationship with Microsoft and build on the over two decades of partnership, innovation, and trust. From the earliest days of the Xbox 360, to the most advanced consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and S, and the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> ROG Xbox Ally handhelds.</em></p>
<p><em>Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimized chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility, so gamers can access their favorite titles across platforms, delivering on a promise to both gamers and developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Together, we are building a vibrant, open ecosystem that delivers the next generation of graphics and immersive gameplay, powered by AI that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering. From console to cloud to handheld, AMD and Microsoft are building the future of immersive gaming. We are so excited to be working with Microsoft to bring all of this tech to gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>The first products born from this deeper partnership to hit the market will be the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch in late October, according to a recent rumor. The next-generation Xbox consoles aren't likely to be released before 2027. Interestingly, both Microsoft president Sarah Bond and AMD's Lisa Su have underlined that the new chips will also power the Xbox cloud offering, which is currently much less attractive than competitors like NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, whose servers are equipped with more powerful hardware. This should make streaming Game Pass titles way more interesting for subscribers.</p>

			<p>Today, 24 Entertainment (the studio behind the successful free-to-play Battle Royale game <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</a>) and NetEase Games announced Blood Message, a single player story-driven action/adventure game, with a stunning trailer. Zhipeng Hu, Lead Producer and NetEase Executive Vice President, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message. As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game is set during the final years of the Tang dynasty. As a mere messenger who joined the Dunhuang uprising, players must traverse a treacherous 1,000-mile journey back to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang empire. They must cross lethal landscapes, including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia, to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain and overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes — not emperors or generals, but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, a father and son must navigate a crumbling world, torn between their duty to their country and their love for their family. 24 Entertainment reckons that the world has heard enough stories of emperors and generals, which is why Blood Message is different. The studio also described the game as linear and narrative-driven, not to mention anchored in cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Players can look forward to visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics. It will be, according to the developers, a deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity. Throughout Blood Message, players will traverse expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang.</p>

<p>The game is being developed for PC and consoles, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with proprietary technologies crafted by 24 Entertainment. There is no release window yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units.1223658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer NEOWIZ has <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Soulslike game Lies of P has surpassed 3 million copies sold globally.</p>
<p>It had been a while since we got a sales update. The only official one was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> in October 2023, when NEOWIZ revealed that the game had sold over one million units in less than one month.</p>
<p>Of course, when interpreting Lies of P sales figures, we also have to consider that the game was available on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service from day one. As such, many more gamers will have actually played it. Furthermore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a rumor</a>, the game might be in development for the Nintendo Switch 2. If that's the case, sales could get even higher.</p>
<p>Lies of P recently launched its Overture DLC, which received the same score (8/10) as the base game in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>. Here's a quote from the article:</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</em></p>
<p>Looking ahead, a Lies of P sequel is all but inevitable considering these sales. NEOWIZ isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, though; we know they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a sci-fi horror game project, and they've also signed publishing deals with several developers, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-studio-will-publish-an-upcoming-noir-western-rpg-from-ex-cdpr-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WolfEye Studios</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-will-publish-the-detective-adventure-game-kill-the-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowlight</a>.</p>
