			<p>This morning, Japanese publisher and developer CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Resident Evil 4 remake has sold over nine million units since its debut in late March 2023. It is no doubt a remarkable result, especially when considering that the game is essentially the same as the 2005 classic from a content standpoint.</p>
<p>The first three million units <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were sold</a>&nbsp;<span>just two days after launch. The fourth million mark&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was passed</a>&nbsp;in early April 2023, while the fifth&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached</a> in late July 2023. CAPCOM provided the next sales update around the game's first anniversary, when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that&nbsp;</span>the Resident Evil 4 remake had sold over seven million copies.</p>
<p>The game was well received overall by critics, too, though our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't quite love it</a> (but still gave it an 8.5 out of 10):</p>
<p><em>Now, I have to say, while the tone of the last few paragraphs has been a bit negative, whether we’re talking about the original or the remake, Resident Evil 4 is still a very good game. I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The Resident Evil 4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>2025 might be a big year for the franchise, at least when it comes to announcements. Resident Evil 9 is expected to be unveiled, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially with a late 2025 launch window</a>, and there are already rumors that the atmosphere will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Resident Evil 4</a> while also having two 'unkillable stalkers' possibly inspired by Resident Evil 3's Nemesis. The playable characters are rumored to be two of the most iconic protagonists in the series: Jill Valentine (Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil 5) and Leon Kennedy (Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K23 Servers Officially Closed Down Today]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today.1074606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For many, this doesn't come as a surprise. WWE 2K23 was removed from all storefronts on November 1, 2024. It's now been taken one step further, with all online functionality for the title being removed. This means that anyone who was hoping to scrap against their friends in some online matches will no longer be able to do so. Instead, you will now have to resort to purchasing the latest game in the franchise, WWE 2K24. This title was only released in March 2024, and with an economic crisis and games being relatively pricey, people have to pick and choose which games they're picking up and when.</p>
<p>For a fair amount of players, WWE 2K23 losing online functionality won't affect them whatsoever. However, for those who haven't had the chance or funds to pick up the latest game in the franchise, it does make the franchise inaccessible. Compared to previous titles, this game didn't even have long in terms of online functionality, as it lasted less than two years before all of the servers were pulled.</p>
<p>Thus far, 2K hasn't given a reason as to why WWE 2K23's servers have closed down, just the broad statement that they were shutting down when announcing that the game was equally being pulled from storefronts in November. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued. This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However, if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.</em></p>
<p>Whether they will announce why this has happened is uncertain, as they commonly shut down servers for their old sports games, such as NBA 2K23 also being delisted from digital storefronts in December, 2024. However, some fans were expecting that 2K would push the date back and give fans more time with WWE 2K23. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>Now, the only game in the WWE franchise that has online functionality is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-launch-roster-vince-mcmahon-brock-lesnar/">WWE 2K24</a>. If you want to purchase this game, the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard edition</a> of the title will set you back around $69.99. There are also many different editions and bundles you can get, which can set you back up to a whopping $139.99, depending on what edition of the game you get. However, the most expensive version of the game does come in a bundle with NBA 2K25 and TopSpin 2K25. These games have recently been on sale for the festive period, but the sale is soon ending, meaning those who want to get their hands on the new wrestling game will have to pay top price for it.</p>
<p>Will you miss WWE 2K23?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/all-infinity-nikki-codes-how-to-redeem-january-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Infinity Nikki is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">latest gacha game</a> to take the world by storm and is the perfect game for those who are fans of dress-up games and enjoy the platforming from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, as those elements feature very heavily in this game. For those who want to get stuck, the game is <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely free to play</a> and is available on PC, iOS, Android, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>For those just getting stuck in it or those who have sunk a fair amount of time into it, there are some codes that you can use to give you access to free rewards. Of course, like any game that has redeemable codes, they will expire after some time. These are the current active codes for January 2025 in Infinity Nikki.</p>
<h2>All Active Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>PEARFECTGUIDES - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>NIKKIXWEBTOON - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>INGIFT1205 - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some additional international codes that you can use. To be able to use them, we recommend copying and pasting them on a PC or mobile.</p>
<ul>
<li>ニキプレゼント1205 - 50 Shiny Bubbles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>おめでとう - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>リリース - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>

<li>インフィニキDISCORD&nbsp;- 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<p>To redeem Infinity Nikki codes, you need to have access to your Pear-Pal. You get this once you have met Dada Florawish Stylist's Guild. This is very early on in the story, so you'll find this area quickly. Once you've done that, there will be a gear icon below the Pear-Pal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gear, and it will open the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Select 'Other'</li>
<li>There will be a Redeem Code box</li>
<li>Click on it and enter your code</li>
<li>Press 'Apply'</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your code has been entered correctly, you will get the rewards from the code. It will give you a notification about the items you've been given for using the code. There may be a message telling you that the code is incorrect or expired. As we said earlier, the codes are time-sensitive, and it's possible that the codes have now expired, and you will no longer be able to get rewards for them. Check out the expired codes below to see if the one you tried to enter is on the list.</p>
<h2>Expired Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NIKKI20241022 -&nbsp;</strong>10,000 Bling, 20 Threads of Purity and 5 Crystals</li>

			<p>2024, what a year. It has seen the utter decimation of thousands of jobs, the failures of countless "Triple-A" games and a few <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Quadruple-A" games</a>, and a general downturn in the games industry. My favourite genres - strategy and simulation - haven't had a great year, with few marquee titles. Even the stalwart of the simulation genre, Football Manager, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was delayed</a> in a move that made 2024 the break from the annual saga that started in 2003 (for the best, in my opinion) - and a number on my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated</a> list did not see a release, with one cancellation.</p>
<p>We can't be talking about games that haven't even come out yet; we need to be talking about Strategy and Simulation games that have been released, so let's dive into Wccftech's Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2024. As always, games that aren't released cannot be used on this list, so there are no early-access titles, nor can remasters.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports &amp; Racing</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Homeworld 3 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy (Real-Time Strategy).&nbsp; <strong>Platform:</strong> PC.</p>
<p>It's most certainly the biggest name on this list. Homeworld 3 is one I first got hands-on with back in 2022. It had a delay, but it finally got a release in 2024, which was successful. While there were a few issues at launch, Homeworld 3 was and is a great game that returns you to the world and gameplay of the classic titles.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in the summary of my review of Homeworld 3:</p>
<p><em>Homeworld 3 marks a successful return to a long-revered series. Bringing back the successful space strategy series, but improving the combat by a large amount with a more tactical approach, Blackbird Interactive has successfully made their mark. With exceptional tactical combat, made all the more important by the fact that everything carries over, and one bad mistake could cripple you much further down the line. The additional War Games mode only enhances this, making for a very engaging title.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation.&nbsp; <strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a game I was very much looking forward to, being on my most anticipated list. When I got hands-on with it in previews, I was even more interested before I finally got to review it upon release. My summary back then was:</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</em></p>
<p>I stick by this. Frostpunk 2 is an excellent game that firmly expanded on the original while keeping what made it great. The move from the single core to creating districts made perfect sense. Expanding the world map elements, creating outposts, and more added a whole new level to the game. This is one I recommend and one I would argue is the best game of the year on this list.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Satisfactory (<a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation. <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Satisfactory is a monster of a game. Launching first into Early Access back when I was still cuddled up in my safety blanket, nestled with a nice bottle of lukewarm milk, the thirty-year-old me never knew that it would take five and a half years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully release</a>, but even before release, it would sell 5.5 million copies.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, and it's well deserved. In a genre that rarely reaches such wide reaches, Satisfactory turned building a factory - albeit one on an alien planet where you also have to survive - into something millions wanted to buy and play and an average daily player base that would make most "AAA" games envious.</p>
<p>There's not much I can say about this game that you don't already know because you play it or you've looked and decided you aren't interested. The level of detail, as complex as it is, is made so easy to get into. The creativity is excellent. The gameplay is enjoyable and addictive. Satisfactory has it all, and its success reflects that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ara-History-Untold-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Ara: History Untold (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based Strategy (4x). <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games has finally produced another game after their debut title. While their first game is mostly remembered for being an early DirectX 12/Asynchronous Compute <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-escalation-updated-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a>, Ara: History Untold, which Xbox Game Studios published, is very much focused on the gameplay experience. It's also turn-based, whereas Ashes was a real-time strategy game. Here's what I had to say about Ara in the review:</p>
<p><em>I must admit, when not writing this review, my brain kept saying, "I like this, but", and I'd decided that I was leaning towards around a score of six and a half, but putting everything on paper and playing more, I was wrong. Ara: History Untold is a genuinely good 4X strategy game, but it has its issues. If you like the genre, you will like this. If you want a 4X with even more added depth, this will tickle your pleasure zones. I fully intend to play it more.</em></p>
<h2>Community Poll</h2>
<p>Now that the shortlist has been announced, you can vote to determine the community's winner for this category!</p>
<div id="democracy-1386" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1386,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Best Strategy/Simulation Game of 2024</strong></p></div>
<h2>Strategy and Simulation Games in 2024, and Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>I think it's been a slow year for Strategy and Simulation games. There have only been a few marquee titles in Homeworld 3 and Frostpunk 2, but nothing that could let 2024 compete with what is still arguably the best year for the genres in recent memory: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-strategy-games-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only human, as we all are, so there are some good-looking strategy and simulation games that we haven't played due to time or any other reason. Some such titles are <a href="https://www.songsofconquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs of Conquest</a>, <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Coaster 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ug1775.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate General: American Revolution</a>, and <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 Manager 2024</a>, to name a few. Still, of the others we have played, here are some noteworthy titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic (<a href="https://www.sovietrepublic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Empires of the Undergrowth (<a href="https://eotugame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option (<a href="https://www.door407.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this has been a slow year, thanks to delays and cancellations, there are positives to look forward to. Games in early access will emerge from it, and new games will be released - likely stalwarts of genres such as Total War and, of course, Football Manager. Roll on the games of 2025!</p>

			<p>New alleged pictures of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controller surfaced online today, providing a new look at the new version of the controller launching together with the system.</p>
<p>The new pictures, which were shared on the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwordfishAgile3472</a>, showcase the controller's side and back, providing a new look at the simple color scheme and at some of the changes from the current controller, such as bigger shoulder buttons and more. While there is no way to know if the pictures showcase the real controller, it looks legit with its attention to detail and the presence of a serial number, which could put the leaker in some serious trouble with Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/">u/SwordfishAgile3472</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>2025 has barely begun, but we still managed to learn plenty of new things regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, even without an official announcement. A few days ago, pictures showcasing the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherboard</a> surfaced online, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">heavily scrutinized</a> in the attempt to determine the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the console. A patent filed by Nintendo earlier this week also seems to confirm the system will indeed support NVIDIA DLSS upscaling, as has been rumored for a good while.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>
