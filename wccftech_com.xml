			<p>To celebrate the 6th anniversary of Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment has released a Dev Diary where players can find out about what to expect for the rest of the year, as well as some major updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">the game</a>. This includes features such as Matchmaking, Anti-Cheat, and Competitive Integrity. If you want to see what's coming in Apex Legends: Takeover, make sure to check out the Dev Diary below, where Game Director Steven Ferreira and Design Director Evan Nikolich will be discussing the update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are some major changes coming with Takeover, including Creator Commissioners. This means that some of the community's favorite Creators will be bringing in unique and curated challenges to Apex Legends with Creator-selected Legendary Weapon Skins and Apex Pack rewards. If you want to participate, you can get these rewards both solo and as a community, giving you plenty of opportunities to get the skins.</p>
<p>For those who have a competitive streak, there will be some major meta changes to give the game a mix-up. This includes Assault Legends getting new perks such as Extra Firepower, Armed and Dangerous, and players now getting extra ammo, grenade slots, and improved weapon handling. For the first time in Apex Legends' history, every single weapon in the game has got a buff this season, meaning some of the favorite weapons used will be more dangerous than ever.</p>
<p>To celebrate six years of Apex Legends, there will also be an anniversary event. In total, there are 36 Anniversary Event items that you can obtain, with every item being Legendary or above. This includes Heirloom Shards and the first-of-its-kind Mythic R-301.</p>
<p>The Mythic R-301 is a Wraith-inspired weapon that has three unlockable tiers with a void-inspired look. Along with its release, there will be new animations for the weapon, including reloads and enemy knock effects.</p>
<p>There were already many ways to get weaponry and gear from around the map, but Apex Legends is now receiving a new feature named Arsenals. These are weapon stations that bring every weapon of a single ammo type and can be seen from the sky. Having these in the games it means that there is a level of planning that players can utilize rather than relying on RNG to get good loot.</p>
<p>For information on the Anti-Cheat changes and Competitive Integrity, there is a news post available on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/dev-update-0225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Apex Legends website</a> where you can find out more about what changes they've made to the system.</p>
<p>The Apex Legends: Takeover trailer will be released tomorrow, where you'll get to see some of the brand-new features in action. After that, you won't have long to wait, as the update will be launching on February 11 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

			<p>Nearly seven years after the original, Kingdom Come Deliverance II has finally landed with much fanfare. The first-person open world roleplaying game by Warhorse Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has earned a perfect score from Wccftech</a> and several other major publications. In our review, Chris Wray summarized his experience playing Kingdom Come Deliverance II with the following words:</p>
<p><em> If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance II. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this. [...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>
<p>The game also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially became a million-seller</a>. On Steam, it <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaked</a> at 167K concurrent users, which is almost double the peak of the original, and there's a solid chance it will get higher during the coming weekend. With this kind of popularity and an active modding community already hard at work, here's an early Kingdom Come Deliverance II mod roundup for PC users.</p>
<p>Warhorse's franchise is known to be quite simulative and realistic, but some players may not necessarily love all the restrictions put in place by the developers. Arguably, the key one is the limited save system. Just like in the first installment, this sequel only lets you save if you sleep in an owned bed or if you use the mythical Saviour Schnapps potion. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlimited Saving II by EddieShoe</a> restores regular quick saving functionality, which can be triggered in-game simply by pressing the traditional F5 key.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/13?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weight Radius XP PTF by zsadik52</a> mixes various convenience tweaks: weight capacity increase to 600, herb picking radius increase, and XP increase. The author provided various options to pick from; the herb picking radius can be increased by 10x or 100x, and the experience gain can be tweaked with five options: 0.5x XP, 1x XP, 2x XP, 4x XP, and 10x XP.</p>
<p>Speaking about gathering herbs, authors HerrTiSo and CryptLoad have released two dedicated mods: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instant Herb Picking II</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First-Person Herb Picking II</a>. As you'd guess from the respective names, the first one removes the third-person animation to make herb picking much quicker, whereas the second mod simply lets the regular animation play out while keeping the first-person view.</p>
<p>Continuing with the convenience theme, modder pavelk has released mods to double <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation gains</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potion duration</a>. He also removed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/61?tab=posts&amp;BH=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food decay</a> (so it doesn't rot in your inventory), the map's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fog of war</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letterboxing in cutscenes</a>.</p>
<p>ryhBread's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stay Clean for Longer</a> ensures that Kingdom Come Deliverance II protagonist Henry doesn't have to wash as often, while <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Jump Stamina</a> removes any stamina costs associated with jumping. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Stamina</a> by MagusTheMagician increases stamina regeneration for both Henry and his horse.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Helmet Vision at 75% opacity</figcaption></figure>
<p>JustAnOrdinaryGuy also released several useful mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Helmet Vision</a>, which either outright removes helmet vision or optionally makes it more bearable. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/83" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Smithing</a> makes it easier to craft weapons by eliminating quality loss and reducing the amount of hammering required, while <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Sharpening</a> expands the ideal angle when sharpening your weapon on a grindstone. Lastly, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/73" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richer Merchants</a> increases the wealth of NPC merchants, ensuring they've got money to purchase the stuff you're selling.</p>
<p>So far, there's not much on the technical front when it comes to Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods, except for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutscene FPS Unlocker</a>. However, that will undoubtedly change over time, and we'll make sure to cover any major graphics or performance mod.</p>
