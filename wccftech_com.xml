			<p>Ahead of tomorrow's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a>,</strong> the rest of the games coming to <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> for January 2026 and heading into February have been revealed, with an additional <strong>10 games</strong> joining the subscription service, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, and <strong>The Talos Principle 2.</strong></p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-games-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws/">games already added from the start of the month</a>, which one user described as a "<em>damn good month</em>," another user on ResetEra called this back-half a "<em>really good batch</em>" of games. In total, subscribers get <strong>17 new games</strong> to check out as part of their Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Premium members only miss out on three of the titles joining the service this month, whereas anyone on the Essential tier is missing out on, well, all of them. </p>



<p>So far, since <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Microsoft raised the prices on Game Pass subscriptions and reorganized it</a></strong> into the three tiers (Ultimate, Premium, and Essential), it's been clear that the bottom 'Essential' tier is really just for those who want to be able to use Cloud services and play games online. If you want access to the Game Pass library of games, you need to be at least at the middle-level Premium tier, and Microsoft makes subscribers aware of this every time a new batch of Game Pass games includes nothing for players on the Essential tier.</p>



<p>On the flip side, while Microsoft is seemingly making players aware that Essential is the worst deal among the Game Pass options, it is also consistently making them aware that just paying for PC Game Pass is the best deal. Of course, this isn't a good option for console players, but if you have the means to just play on your PC, it's easily your best bet as you're still getting everything Ultimate subscribers are getting at a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>But if you're paying for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or even just Game Pass Premium, then beyond the aforementioned titles like Space Marine 2, The Talos Principle 2, and Death Stranding, you also have 2024's indie hit, <strong>Indika</strong>, 2025's excellent action-platformer, <strong>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</strong>, and the physics-driven driving sim, <strong>RoadCraft</strong>, to look forward to this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Xbox Game Pass for the rest of January 2026, when they'll arrive, where you can play them, and what subscription tier you need to be at to access them:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding: Director's Cut - January 21 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>

This time, on <strong>January 31, 2026</strong>, an additional six games are leaving the service, with a couple of notable departures, including Citizen Sleeper 2 and Lonely Mountains Snow Riders.</p>
