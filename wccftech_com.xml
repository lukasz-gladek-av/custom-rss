			<p>Despite the Harry Potter franchise being incredibly dated at this point, it still has a considerable fanbase. As a result, more and more content within the IP continues to be released, with Hogwarts Legacy being one of the latest endeavors of Warner Bros. Not only have there been books, games, and movies, they are now branching out into a TV show, which is due to debut on HBO in 2026. However, it turns out that Warner Bros. has made Hogwarts Legacy a 'huge priority.' It's no surprise that Hogwarts Legacy ended up being the top-selling game of 2023 and has sold over 30 million units as of last month. With the success of Hogwarts Legacy, they've also released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions and a remaster of the Lego Harry Potter games.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's Chief Financial Officer has said that a direct sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is a goal for the development team moving forward. "Obviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road," says WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> at the Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications &amp; Entertainment Conference. Although Hogwarts Legacy was quite successful, that doesn't mean that every game recently released by Warner Bros. has been. The most recent big release for the studio was Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and that did not sell very well at all. It's been considered a "miss" by the company, and it seems that they are pivoting heavily into more Harry Potter content.</p>
<p>While they have released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, it's worth noting that this game is in no way a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy, and is treated as it's own standalone title. However, it's been confirmed by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Haddad</a>, the President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, that they are looking for ways to produce content within the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>"We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that. Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this IP belongs to J.K. Rowling, it's been confirmed that she is not involved with the management of the franchise but is instead receiving updates via her literary agent. It's been stated that the game development team behind Hogwarts Legacy has been working on some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the sequel, with the storylines set to play out in the Harry Potter HBO TV series. Whether this means they are directly linked and are considered a canon event seems a little bit up in the air right now.</p>
<p>Harry Potter doesn't seem to be dying any time soon, with experiences being opened in the Universal Theme Park, new games consistently being in development or released, and many new ways to create content. Hogwarts Legacy is set to get a<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/"> remastered version</a> in the future, adding extra content for players to explore.</p>

			<p>The newest <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/from-the-rift-season-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major update</a> for Apex Legends is out, and is titled From The Rift. In this update, fans will be able to relive the original Apex Games in Launch Royale, where you'll be able to play Lifeline, who is revived with new abilities. Launch Royale takes players back to the original Kings Canyon, where you'll get to experience the game as it initially started, playing with only the original Legends, Weapons, and Loot. With this, it means there are no EVO Armor or Ability Upgrades, and you have to rely on fast reactions and skill to be able to survive in this game mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: From the Rift Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve-pSwKn79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to Lifeline, she is back and better than ever. With this, Lifeline is revived as a "Frontline menace." This sees Lifeline get a new kit, where she can teleport DOC to allies who need healing, as well as the ability to deploy a forcefield that makes healing more effective for the whole squad. With a healer this strong, there will be a lot more chaos than there was previously.</p>
<p>In addition to the Launch Royale being added back to Apex Legends, players will be able to get Rift Relics. This will be noticeable due to the appearance of cosmic portals, which are the signal for a Rift Relic. This comes with some of the most iconic, overpowered weapons in the series, along with Boost Kits, which can make or break the build for the players who manage to get their hands on the Rift Relic. To get the Rift Relic, you just have to destroy it to get the reward. However, if it moves outside of the Ring, you may not be able to get the reward as it becomes unstable.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand-new Universal Melee cosmetic is being added to the game called Raptor's Claw. This is a universal Melee cosmetic that you'll be able to get through the Void Mercenary Store from November 5 through to January 7. Additionally, once you've unlocked this cosmetic, you'll be able to get the Crystal Chamber Death Box, which has five other variants to match the Death Boxes. The Raptor's Claw cosmetic will then be moved to the Mythic Shop after January 7.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-removes-steam-deck-support-due-to-cheating/">massive update</a> for Apex Legends and adds a ton of new content, including new support class perks and better skill displays. This is intended to help balance out the matches better and will update live as each player loads into the game, showing you the ranking of the other players you're up against.</p>
