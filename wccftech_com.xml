			<p>The first batch of Xbox Game Pass games for 2026 <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/">has been revealed</a>, with a strong lineup of seven games joining the service, including Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, and three titles already included in the service at the Ultimate tier now available at the second-rung, Premium tier.</p>



<p>One user on ResetEra called this batch a "<em>damn good month</em>," and it's no surprise considering how many big names are included in the first dump of Game Pass games to start off 2026. It even has at least one day-one release with MIO: Memories in Orbit, a new metroidvania from publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Douze Dixièmes.</p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest additions to the subscription service this month are the aforementioned Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, the new remaster of the original Little Nightmares</a> that was released last year and included in any player's pre-order of Little Nightmares III.</p>



<p>As for what's being made available to Premium tier subscribers, players at the second tier will be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>, and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition without having to jump up to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of what's coming to Game Pass this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Brews &amp; Bastards - January 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
