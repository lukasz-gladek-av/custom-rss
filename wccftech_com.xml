			<p>Earlier today, Gearbox Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> up the official pre-orders for Borderlands 4. Fans of the looter shooter franchise certainly held their breath for a while when Gearbox president Randy Pitchford wouldn't confirm the pricing, and now they can rest a bit easier knowing that the game won't be priced at $80 as some had feared.</p>
<p>Alongside the opening of pre-orders, though, the Texas-based development studio also revealed the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Borderlands 4. They can be read on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> pages, although we've posted them below too for your convenience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p>Considering that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5, these system requirements are fairly tame compared to others we've seen. The game is also said to offer the largest and most seamless map in the franchise, with anything you see in the distance reachable by the players.</p>
<p>Traversal has been improved, too, with moves such as double jumping, gliding, dodging, and grappling available. As with the previous entries, drop-in, drop-out cooperative gameplay is said to be the centerpiece of the game, and cross-play is also supported (although you'll need to sign up for a SHiFT Account to join fellow teammates from other platforms).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to debut on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
