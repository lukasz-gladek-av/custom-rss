			<p>First-person survival horror game Stygian: Outer Gods, which launched in early access this past April, has just received its first major content update in its early access journey titled Souls of the Silent Tide. </p>



<p>The new update was released alongside a new trailer, showcasing the introduction of the House of Mists and some of the new horrors that players will experience in Souls of the Silent Tide.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide will have you carefully treading through the ritual site of head witch Agata, though there's also a secret area that you'll have to explore to find, as developer Misterial Games doesn't want to spoil that surprise.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You'll also meet new characters, and face a few new enemies to defeat, alongside some you're already familiar with that have been given a bit of an updated moveset.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide also includes a new weapon for players to stand against these horrors with, and the update includes the first boss fight that's been added to the game.</p>



<p>If you've not yet checked out Stygian: Outer Gods, this update is a good time to check it out, not just because you'll have what was available at launch, plus this new chunk of content to play through, but because as part of the update's arrival, Misterial Games is discounting Stygian: Outer Gods for a limited time with a 20% discount.</p>



<p>After the sale however, Misterial Games and publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-smoke-and-mirrors-update-july-17/">Fulqrum Publishing</a> confirm that the price of the early access release will actually increase to $24.99 USD / 24.99 EUR / 20.99 GBP. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has arrived at Gamescom 2025 with two significant The Division 2-related announcements. Beginning with what the company is calling a "<em>survival extraction experience</em>," The Division 2: Survivors is due to launch sometime in 2026 and is the latest major part of what's been a long-tail for The Division 2 support.</p>



<p>The other big announcement is the arrival of a mobile game in The Division series, with a new free-to-play MMO called The Division Resurgence. </p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors will bring an updated take on the survival extraction experience to The Division 2</em>," Ubisoft writes in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence">blog post</a>. Development on it is still "<em>in the early stages</em>," and is being led by Magnus Jansén as its creative director, who has been with the series since the first game which launched in 2016.</p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours,"</em> adds executive producer Julian Gerighty, "<em>and we strive for transparency during its development. Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey</em>." Speaking of Gerighty, he's also directing The Division 3, which we've still not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">since it was first announced in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>That's all Ubisoft had to say about Survivors for now, though they did share a few images of concept art. </p>

<p>It also showed a graphic for a roadmap for The Division series, which, you'll notice, doesn't include The Division 3. </p>

<p>Regarding The Division Resurgence, Ubisoft says it will have "<em>the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming."</em> It'll take players into Manhattan, and be set a few months after the events of the first Division game.</p>



<p>Even though it is an exclusive mobile release, which might immediately make fans of The Division who play the games on PC or consoles disinterested, if you're big on the lore and story of the series, you might want to consider checking it out, since "<em>the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time</em>."</p>



<p>That said, you could also just wait to watch a recap on YouTube. But if you are keen to actually play through the story content, you can register for it now, and potentially take part in a closed beta test.</p>

<p>The last major update for The Division 2 was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">Battle for Brooklyn</a> which launched earlier this year. The next major update is the launch of Year 7's season 2, The Pact, which launches in a few weeks from the time of this writing on September 9.</p>

			<p>Publisher A Plus and developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology have announced that Blue Protocol: Star Resonance will arrive on PC, iOS, and Android this coming October 2025. Pre-registration for mobile players also kicks off today, as well as the closed beta test for participants on PC.</p>



<p>If you're looking to play Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on mobile, then you can pre-register for the game on its <a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">official website</a>. If you'd rather check it out on PC, then instead of just waiting for its October launch, you can jump into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/">closed beta test through Steam</a> starting today. If you missed the chance to sign up for the beta test, A Plus has confirmed that it will "<em>continuously release codes depending on the server capacity after the test begins</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Star Resonance marks the return of the MMORPG after the original Blue Protocol release, which first arrived in Japan in 2023, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down a year later,</a> and had its release outside of Japan cancelled. It officially shut down this past January, with the reason for its closure simply being that it was unable to garner enough of a player base to keep going.</p>



<p>If you're happy to see it return and are looking forward to its October launch, beyond the closed beta test, A Plus has confirmed that attendees at the Anime NYC convention will be able to check out a playable demo of the game.</p>
