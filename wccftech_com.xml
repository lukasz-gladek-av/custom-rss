			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 pricing pressure in the United States has eased thanks to the pausing of the tariffs announced last week, and the console will likely be widely available at its announced price when it launches on June 5th.</p>
<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDI2Mzk0NywiZXhwIjoxNzQ0ODY4NzQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVUg2WTRUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZEIyQWKfjdHBpVs7zO7eZStqT-Y5Xj20QhPKsgOroaw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> suggests there should be more than enough units available to meet demand, as per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">company's plans</a>. According to new customs data provided by NBD, Hosiden Corp, one of the three main Nintendo Switch 2 assemblers based in Vietnam, shipped a total of 785,700 units in February, 725,200 of them to the United States in February, more units than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. With the looming threat of the tariffs, Nintendo can focus all the production in Vitenam to the United States, suggesting millions of consoles can be shipped from the country in time for the June launch.</p>
<p>As for how the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 could be impacted by the tariffs after launch, there's more uncertainty. According to Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu, if the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo will probably keep the announced $499.99 price and take a hit on the margins, given how the company will want to have a thriving system that could expand its user base and make its diversification strategy centered on its iconic IPs even more successful. If they are raised to 46%, however, the system's price is expected to increase between $50 and $100.</p>
<p>Considering the latest developments, there's a very good chance Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will finally begin in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">Canada</a> after having been delayed last week in preparation for its June 5th launch. Not every Nintendo fan in the world, however, will be able to get the system on that day, as it has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely in China.</a></p>

			<p>A port of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD on Nintendo Switch 2 is still a possibility, despite the original GameCube release being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/">Nintendo Switch Online library.</a></p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinda Funny Games</a> during last week's press event, which allowed media to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD could still be released on the new system, as all options are on the table. While the port hasn't been confirmed, it has been highlighted how games being available via the Nintendo Switch Online service hasn't prevented other versions of said games from being released on the original Switch, so there's still hope to see the remaster breaking free from the Wii U captivity it has been since its release.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, we have been hearing rumors of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD getting ported to Nintendo Switch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">quite some time</a>, but neither game has ever materialized, leaving fans no other option than playing the Wii U releases. While both games feature plenty of improvements over the original releases, Zelda: Wind Waker HD definitely sports the most significant changes, with plenty of gameplay improvements that make it, together with the enhanced visuals, the definitive way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series to date.</p>
