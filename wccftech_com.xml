			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>

			<p>Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked, is arriving in theatres on November 21, 2025, and there is reportedly a very good Mario-themed reason to go see it. According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">X (formerly Twitter) user My Time to Shine</a>, which has a reputation for publishing scoops within the movie world, the first proper trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be shown at screenings of Wicked: For Good.</p>



<p>"<em>The Mario Galaxy trailer will be attached to Wicked For Good meaning it will release online before November 21st</em>," My Time to Shine writes on their X (formerly Twitter) post.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">This past September</a>, we learned that the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. The Movie would be called 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' and it would be arriving in theatres on April 3, 2026. With a release date set for next Spring, it makes a lot of sense that it would have a new major trailer debut with one of the last major box office debuts left in 2025.</p>



<p>And as My Time to Shine points out, with the trailer making its way to theatres before the end of this month, that means it'll likely appear online within the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When the title and release date were revealed for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, we got a very short teaser trailer that briefly showed the Mushroom Kingdom, following a golden yellow butterfly through the kingdom and into the sky for the title reveal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever trailer we get next will likely provide our first insights into the basic plot that this sequel will follow and reveal a little more about which characters will be involved, both returning and new.</p>

			<p>Many fans of the series feel that Battlefield 6's maps are smaller than the rest of the series, and it seems like they were right, judging from a comparison put together by a member of the community.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bf1/">Battlefield subreddit</a>, user ClaraTheRed shared a couple of comparison images that show all of the series' 87 maps, their total and playable area, their shapes and how they rank in terms of size.</p>



<p>The findings are not in the Battlefield 6 maps' favor at all. The game's largest map, Operation Firestorm, a remade version of Battlefield 3's map, ranks 32nd in terms of playable space. It is also considerably smaller than the original, which ranks at 7th in terms of playable area.</p>



<p>Every other Battlefield 6 map ranks relatively low in the total ranking for playable space. Mirak Valley is the largest of the game's original maps, ranking 35th, while the smallest, Saints Quarter, is also the 2nd smallest map in the entire series. As such, those who felt that the game's maps were small were clearly onto something, even without doing an accurate comparison as the user ClaraTheRed did.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While many of the largest maps in the series were DLC maps released long after each respective game, there's no denying that Battlefield 6's maps do leave something to be desired in terms of playable space, even compared to the launch maps of previous entries in the series. With the community being rather vocal about this matter, it will be interesting to see if the developer will take this feedback into account for future maps, as they have been doing for some other aspects of the game, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://mp1st.com/news/after-community-backlash-devs-remove-battlefield-6s-neon-blue-skin">including the removal of a skin that the community felt didn't fit the setting at all.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>
