			<p>In a Japanese press release <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/897/G089776/20250508027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by 4Gamer</a>, SEGA (the game's publisher in Japan) and Avalanche Software have revealed some technical details of the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced Visuals</em></strong><br>
<em>Experience deeper immersion with significantly upgraded graphics, including NVIDIA DLSS support, improved lighting and shadow animation quality, and anti-aliasing. Experience up to 1440p resolution in TV mode and 1080p and HDR in handheld mode.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Movement</em></strong><br>
<em>Move seamlessly through the open world, including Hogsmeade and its shops, without loading screens.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Flight</em></strong><br>
<em>Thanks to the improved performance of the Nintendo Switch 2, not only is the frame rate higher than the Nintendo Switch version, but the loading times are also shorter. You can fly around the Hogwarts grounds and beyond comfortably.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2</em></strong><br>
<em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2 controller. Enjoy your preferred play style.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution</a>, but developers can choose whether to actually use it or not. It honestly seems like a no-brainer, though, especially for games that have already implemented the feature on the PC version, like Hogwarts Legacy or <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also technically supports ray tracing, but there's no mention of it being implemented in this game, even though the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions (and, of course, the PC version) support it. Indeed, it's highly unlikely that open world games will implement ray tracing in any capacity on the hybrid console, as it would simply be too taxing on the hardware. It could, however, be supported for simpler, smaller games. Anyway, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy will be available at the console's launch (June 5). The game size is 24 GB.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Paradox Interactive unveiled Europa Universalis V, a new installment in the popular grand strategy game. Fans have been waiting for this since Europa Universalis IV launched in 2013. In that regard, they've waited as long as GTA fans.</p>
<p>Europa Universalis V promises more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revamped military system, and greater logistical depth. According to Paradox, it offers the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and Larger Map: Start as a mighty emperor, local chieftain, or warlord in a more detailed and accurate world map with hundreds of playable societies and varied terrain.</li>
<li>Longer Time Scale: Begin in 1337 and guide a nation through centuries of historical change, including the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and other historical ages.</li>
<li>Population-Based System: Rule over detailed populations with cultural, religious, and class dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting, as the developers are touting that populations are represented on the map in detail for the first time in the franchise. This means provinces may be divided by religion or culture. The player's choices will determine how these populations fare under their leadership.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis V doesn't have a release date yet, but you can already add the game to your Steam wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mafia: The Old Country developer Hangar 13 dug into plenty of behind-the-scenes details about making The Old Country during a PAX East panel. The team discussed their approach to making The Old Country, a few more details about the game's narrative, and also revealed a few core members of the cast.</p>
<p>The panel was hosted by Greg Miller from Kinda Funny Games, with Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, game director Alex Cox, and cinematic director Tomas Hrebick representing the development team for <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot we already know about The Old Country, some of which we learned more about during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">gameplay trailer that was revealed ahead of the panel</a>. One aspect fans were happy to hear was that The Old Country would be closer in style to the first two Mafia games in that The Old Country is a more linear experience, and not necessarily an open-world game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - &quot;Family Takes Sacrifice&quot; Developer Presentation | PAX East" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmeirFVVzCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes did however clarify this point, that while the game will have you on a golden path through the story, you're still free to roam the new setting of 1900's Sicily and explore the world that the team has meticulously created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>In terms of the gameplay, Baynes called it "<em>familiar, but better</em>," while Cox elaborated that there are elements to the gameplay and scenarios that are unique to The Old Country due to the new setting for the series, since each previous Mafia game has been set in an American city. Some of the missions and things you'll do in The Old Country however, are purposeful callbacks to activities veterans of the series will recognize that have been re-tooled to fit The Old Country.</p>
<p>Knife dueling, for example, is one of the new additions to gameplay that we get a short look at in the trailer, that will play a significant role in The Old Country's combat. That's not to say you won't be using a gun every now and then, as the trailer also showed a fair bit of gunplay that Cox and the panel likened more to the first Mafia game, than Mafia III, which was a more bombastic experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the narrative, we were introduced to three cast members who are playing three main roles in the story. Enzo Favara, the lead character in The Old Country and the person you play as in the game, is played by Riccardo Frascari. The Don of the Torrisi family, Bernado Torrisi is played by Johnny Santiago, and Torrisi's daughter, Isabella Torrisi is played by Carina Conti.</p>
<p>Speaking of characters, towards the end of the panel, Cox did confirm that there will be as many as four returning characters from previous Mafia games making an appearance in Mafia: The Old Country, though he did not reveal who it would be and how, to avoid spoiling the surprise for players.</p>
<p>One interesting bit about the studio's work to make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible, relates to the cars we see Enzo drive in the game. They're some of the world's earliest vehicles, and Hangar 13 was able to find a collector in the Czech Republic who let the studio photograph, and even drive these cars and record them, to be as accurate as possible with how these old cars would have sounded.</p>
<p>Overall, it's clear that Hangar 13 put in a lot of work to make Mafia: The Old Country as detailed as possible. The game will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming August 8, 2025.</p>
