			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Polish developer Bloober Team (Silent Hill 2 Remake, Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear 2, The Medium, Observer) announced a release window for Cronos: The New Dawn. The new sci-fi IP will debut at some point in the upcoming Fall season on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10011556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p7tflq7ctxn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is already available on all platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, alongside the news, Bloober also presented a new Cronos: The New Dawn trailer, offering a closer look at the terrifying Orphans and revealing intense survival moments inside their nest. The Orphans are twisted monstrosities born from humanity's darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior (they are exceptionally aggressive and relentless), which turns every encounter with them into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent the Orphans from merging. In Cronos: The New Dawn, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. Otherwise, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy.</p>
<p>The new trailer also recounts part of the story of a mysterious predecessor, a traveller ND 3500,&nbsp; and their cryptic travel log. In this game, players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the Polish district of Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p>

<p>Previously, Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the game's combat was inspired by survival horror classics such as Resident Evil and Dead Space. The developers have also been loosely <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by FromSoftware's Dark Souls to make a more challenging game. When it comes to the setting, they were influenced by other media, like the movies 12 Monkeys and The Thing and the TV series Dark.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. The official PC system requirements have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> and don't seem too onerous on paper.</p>
