			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a video message that it aims to release Palworld 1.0 next year. To achieve that goal, they will focus on polishing, which means the rest of 2025 won't feature truly big updates to the early access version. Communications Director and Publishing Manager 'Bucky' explained:</p>



<p><em>We've reached a crossroads and need to decide what comes next. While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about 1.0. Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that it has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year in 2026. And we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game. So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won't be as big as Feybreak was. We hope our players understand that we're taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn't mean there will be no updates. We still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year. We just want to be transparent about where we're headed and the development of Palworld going forward. It is not slowing down or scaling back; quite the opposite. Version 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end.</em></p>



<p>Bucky also said that PocketPair is also doing other things, such as supporting other small developers through a publishing division and even starting to research other game ideas for future projects. Of course, Palworld is still what most of the company is concentrating on, and it couldn't be any different given the incredible success achieved when the game launched in early 2024, breaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record after record</a> for the first few weeks. To this day, PocketPair's survival action monster taming game is third on Steam's all-time concurrent player chart with 2.1 million players. Only Black Myth: Wukong and PUBG have done better. Overall, Palworld has surpassed 32 million players across all platforms earlier this year.</p>



<p>However, the Japanese developer also has to deal with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, which was filed nearly a year ago for alleged patent infringement. PocketPair is fighting the lawsuit in court, but in the meantime, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to introduce some changes to the game</a>.</p>
