			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tone-deaf-hiring-call-ai-slop-microsoft-layoffs/">Xbox</a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/15/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the next batch of games being added to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service, with nine titles entering the service for subscribers for the month of July 2025, including Grounded 2, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Wheel World, RoboCop: Rogue City, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the games added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this month aren't available today, as there are a few games launching directly into the service. The only 'new' game of sorts that players can jump into today with Game Pass, is High on Life, which is returning to the service after it was previously available and removed from the service. </p>



<p>Beginning on July 17, RoboCop: Rogue City and My Friendly Neighborhood are added to the service. For RoboCop, its arrival in Game Pass also lines up with the release of its brand new DLC, Unfinished Business, though the DLC is not available in the Game Pass version that subscribers will have access to. You'll still need to grab the DLC separately if you devour the base game before the month is up.</p>

<p>On July 18, RPG Back to the Dawn enters the service, followed by Abiotic Factor launching into Game Pass on July 22. Then on July 23, Wheel World, a new open-world bicycle game is also launching into the service, followed by yet another day-one launch into Game Pass with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on July 24.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 then launches into early access on Steam and Game Preview on Xbox consoles on July 29, and July's additions are capped off by Farming Simulator 25 joining the service on August 1. Here's the full list of games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the month of July 2025: </p>



<ul>
<li>High on Life - July 15 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>



<li>RoboCop: Rogue City - July 17 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>My Friendly Neighborhood - July 17 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>

<li>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - July 24 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Grounded 2 - July 29 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Farming Simulator 25 - August 1 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this new batch of games entering the service, there are a few games leaving Game Pass as of July 31. It's just three games this time, with Gigantic, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, all leaving the service at the end of the month.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-is-the-mmorpg%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-out-on-october-28.1244214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet is announcing Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, the next expansion coming to the MMORPG after the final update <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for the previous expansion, Janthir Wilds</a>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, ArenaNet <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched to a yearly expansion model</a>. As such, you can expect Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity to launch relatively soon, albeit a couple of months later than Janthir Wilds did in 2024, as Visions of Eternity will be available from October 28. The new expansion is already available for pre-purchase <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/visions-of-eternity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> for $24.99, and includes a bundle of pre-purchase bonus items, including a Tropical Resin Kintsugi weapon set, a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. </p>



<p>The Deluxe Edition, priced at $49.99, comes with the standard edition bundle, plus another batch of exclusive items: a Castoran Tentacled skimmer skin, a set of Fairy’s Call Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Visions of Eternity Ultimate Edition (which costs $74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, Guild Wars 2’s premium in-game store currency.</p>



<p>Guild Wars 2 Game Director Josh Davis said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Visions of Eternity continues our commitment to major yearly content expansions. Over a decade into the game’s life, we’re making improvements and enhancements to game modes and systems, expanding the horizon of Guild Wars 2’s gameplay. This expansion is offering up more elite specializations to further grow the possibilities for player customization and gameplay while becoming more seamlessly accessible across game modes and activities.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new narrative of Visions of Eternity begins with rumors of Castora, a fabled island allegedly rich with magic and ley energy, as told by the seafarers of Tyria. The Tyrian Alliance receives word that the Inquest, the infamous group of evil Asuran technology researchers, has been searching for the island of Castora. Together with allies willing to brave an unknown voyage, the Commander (the title of the player character in Guild Wars 2) sets off to discover the Inquest's goals and stop them before it's too late.</p>



<p>On day one, players will be able to explore two new maps in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, with two more coming throughout 2026 in post-launch updates alongside new Raid Encounters, a new Convergence, new rewards (including new earnable items in the Wizard's Vault), two extensions of the storyline, new legendary gear. </p>



<p>Each profession (the game's term for class) will receive a new Elite specialization, greatly increasing the amount of build options thanks to new traits and utility skills. As with the previous expansions, ArenaNet will open up beta access to the Elite specializations for a week, between August 20 and 27, to anyone with a game account.</p>

<p>The Skimmer aquatic mount will be expanded with three new Mastery lines. The housing-like Homestead system is also being augmented with a new plot on the sunny beaches of Castora and the brand new game-wide Homestead Layout feature, which will allow players to easily and quickly share their customized space with others, allowing a perfect duplicate of a construction (provided that the player has the requisite decorations).</p>



<p>When it comes to new gear, a legendary weapon and a legendary Aquabreather will be available on October 28, with a legendary ring, a legendary accessory, and another legendary weapon to be released in later patches. Of course, there will also be new armor and weapon sets and new Wizards Vault rewards, as mentioned above.</p>



<p>ArenaNet's parent company, NCSoft, may have more or less inadvertently <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertised</a> that the studio is already working on Guild Wars 3, but if that's the case, they still have a big enough team to continue building Guild Wars 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-runescape-dragonwilds/">last week's announcement of the five games</a> that are getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation,<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/marvel-rivals-season-3-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-reflex/"> NVIDIA is back with a few more games</a> that are getting a boost in performance this week, thanks to Multi Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex, with Marvel Rivals, War Thunder, and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business added to the list. </p>



<p>Just in time for the season 3 release in Marvel Rivals, players can enjoy a boost in performance thanks to DLSS 4, with NVIDIA claiming that players can see frame rates multiply by up to 5X, and get latency on their PC reduced by 55% with NVIDIA Reflex enabled. </p>



<p>If you're sporting an RTX 5090, then, according to NVIDIA, you'll be able to run through enemy players in Marvel Rivals at 450 FPS, with all of the game's settings maxed out and playing at 4K. RTX 5080 owners can get up to 330 FPS, RTX 5070 Ti players can get up to 290 FPS, and RTX 5070 players can achieve up to 230 FPS. The more you drop the resolution, the higher your frame rate will go, with even RTX 5060 cards capable of hitting 300 FPS when playing at 1080p. </p>



<p>War Thunder is another game that is adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation in its latest update, which players with RTX 50 series cards can take full advantage of, enabling ray tracing and cranking the settings to get the most detailed image at smooth frame rates. </p>



<p>Lastly, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, the DLC for the 2023 return of the robotic police officer that's due to release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/">just two days at the time of this writing</a>, will launch with the game adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-zenimax-online-developer-has-been-laid-off-following-the-cancellation-of-project-blackbird.1244154/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off following the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">Project Blackbird</a>, a new statement shared online confirmed.</p>



<p>ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project, which came as a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on it, and showing appreciation for the media and players that would have loved to see the game. Unlike what happened at other studios, which saw layoffs following the cancellation of their projects, no ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure, the developers who worked on Project Blackbird still remain at ZeniMax Online with full pay and benefits. Layoffs may still be in the future for some of the members of the union, but as a result of organizing, those impacted will be able to depart the studio with dignity.</p>







<p>As already mentioned, ZeniMax Online Project Blackbird is not the only project that Microsoft confirmed to have cancelled earlier this month. The Perfect Dark reboot announced back in 2020 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">ceased development</a>, and its development studio, The Initiative, has been shut down. Rare's Everwild was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled</a>, while other studios have been considerably downsized, such as Turn 10, the developer of the Forza Motorsport series, which has reportedly become a <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/">Forza Horizon support studio.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Wick Hex Is Being Delisted This Week On All Platforms]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-wick-hex-is-being-delisted-this-week-on-all-platforms.1244109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted this week, publisher Big Fan Games has announced. It'll be entirely removed from sale on all digital platforms as of <strong>July 17, 2025</strong>. If you've already bought the game, you'll be able to continue playing it and redownload it, but if not, you'll miss out on your chance to get the game, seemingly forever. </p>



<p>The news was announced quite suddenly this week, giving players only days to decide whether they wanted to grab it before its gone, or let it pass them by for good. John Wick Hex is critically acclaimed as one of the best games based on a film or TV show in some time, including by Wccftech, who called it "<em>an action choreography masterclass</em>" when <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/">we reviewed it back when it launched in October 2019 on PC</a>. It was out on consoles a year later, in December 2020.</p>



<p>"<em>John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025,</em>" a statement on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675?l=english">Steam page</a> began. "<em>After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Consoles) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront</em>." No reason for the delisting has been given.</p>



<p>With the game being removed in just two days at the time of this writing, that puts its shelf life at less than six years since its release, a short lifetime even for a game based on a licensed series. If anything, it's a wonder why there haven't been more John Wick games, since the release of John Wick Hex was such a critical success. The films have also only grown in success and popularity in the last six years, and with all the collaboration between the video game industry and Hollywood of late, you'd think someone would have been working on making another John Wick game happen.</p>



<p>"<em>When all is said and done, John Wick Hex is an exceptional licensed game, and a wonderful strategic shooter even away from that,</em>" our review reads. "<em>It's the kind of game that's high quality and enjoyable, even if you are clueless about the John Wick movies themselves. The perfect kind of licensed game, that works as well as an introduction to the franchise as it does as an extension of it. Absolutely worth playing</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 5 Is “Fully Greenlit” According To A New Report]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-5-is-%E2%80%9Cfully-greenlit%E2%80%9D-according-to-a-new-report.1244106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Starfield has come and gone, the next major title Bethesda fans are waiting for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. After that, it'll be time for Fallout 5 to finally take center stage in the theatre of Bethesda's development efforts. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/">That's been the plan</a>, according to Bethesda and Todd Howard, who, at this point, will likely finish his career with the release of Fallout 5, considering how long modern video games take to make. According to Windows Central reporter Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s">XB2 podcast</a>, the first major step in making Fallout 5 a reality has been taken, as the game is now "<em>fully greenlit."</em></p>



<p>That said, there's not a lot of clarity as to who is leading the project. According to Corden, a significant number of Bethesda's developers are working on more DLC for Starfield. The remaining staff are full-steam-ahead on The Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout 5 might have been officially added to the docket, but when it enters full production, and who will even be leading the way, isn't entirely clear.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Xbox Game Pass Drama | Mutiple Fallout Games Coming | Xbox Tokyo Game Show - XB2 371" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDr2ZSFIEXk?start=3845&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Howard and his team are the obvious guess, but who knows what Bethesda and Microsoft will look like by the time Fallout 5 is ready to be the full focus of the studio. For now, despite claims that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">Fallout 5 might be moved up the priority list thanks to the success of the TV show</a>, it seems like it'll be a number of years before Fallout 5 is out and on shelves.</p>
