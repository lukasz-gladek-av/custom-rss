			<p>Last week, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired between thirty and forty GTA developers </a>across its offices in Canada and the United Kingdom, triggering accusations by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) that the game studio sought to prevent their attempt to unionize. The IWGB claimed that all those developers were working to that end, and vowed to defend their rights through 'every legal claim possible'.</p>



<p>Initially, Rockstar Games only stated that they had been fired due to a rather generic 'gross misconduct'. Now, though, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received a more detailed statement from a company spokesperson</a>. The GTA and Red Dead Redemption developer claims these employees were 'found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum', in violation of Rockstar's policies. As such, the terminations had nothing to do with union busting, according to the spokesperson.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the IWGB isn't much convinced. Its president, Alex Marshall, replied with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Rockstar is afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</em></p>



<p>Currently, the IWGB <a href="https://x.com/IWGBunion/status/1986081909278212100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is protesting</a> outside Take-Two House, 30 Cleveland Street, London, in solidarity with the fired workers. </p>



<p>There are indeed multiple public forums dedicated to the Grand Theft Auto series, chiefly GTAForums, which is often a source of leaks. However, it doesn't seem like any significant leak was shared there or elsewhere recently. Still, Rockstar Games has taken a deadly serious approach to security following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alleged-gta-6-videos-schreier-its-likely-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big Grand Theft Auto VI leak</a> that occurred on September 18, 2022. A couple of months later, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-reaffirms-that-gta-6-leak-wont-influence-development-or-anything-of-the-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the leak would not affect the development of the game, but Rockstar (and Take-Two) aren't taking any chances now that the finish line is finally in sight.</p>



<p>Originally targeting a Fall 2025 launch window, the most hyped game of all time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now set to launch on May 26, 2026</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X. Of course, a delay could still happen, as shown by Rockstar's track record. Hopefully that won't be needed, especially as it would further delay the PC version (though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CEO of Corsair Gaming</a>, PC gamers might not have to wait as long as with previous franchise entries).</p>

			<p>A few years ago, NetEase Games helped fund several game development studios based in Western countries and Japan. Over the last year, though, many of those were abruptly shut down in the middle of developing those projects that NetEase had expressed interest in the first place.</p>



<p>This includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a> (spearheaded by a Mass Effect writer, who was working with his team on a sci-fi action/adventure game), <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jar of Sparks</a> (founded by former Halo Infinite developers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouka Studios</a> (the only one to actually release their game, Visions of Mana, before being shut down), and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>. The former studio has received an unexpected second wind thanks to a few veterans and directors who decided to invest in retaining the name; the latter now has an expiration date of November 17, although founder Greg Street is still trying to secure funding until the last possible moment. </p>



<p>NetEase must have mandated that November 17 date, as it's the same expiration date that another developer, the Montréal-based Bad Brain Game Studios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicated a few hours ago in a LinkedIn post</a>. Sean Crooks, Studio Head and former Ubisoft developer on Watch Dogs games, is still trying to shop around the game they were working on, The Midnight Riders:</p>



<p><em>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</em></p>



<p>To help showcase their work, they shared a sizzle reel, which makes it look a lot like a proper Stranger Things game. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-brain-game-studios-qa-building-an-open-world-spielberg-ft-king-coming-of-age-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed Sean Crooks in June 2023</a>, he shared his vision for a 'Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King in an open world with a coming-of-age story'. The game was also clearly set in the 1980s.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are other studios whose fate is currently uncertain, such as Jackalyptic Games, which is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a Warhammer-based massively multiplayer online game</a>. Unfortunately, there has been no official update, only rumors that Jack Emmert and his team are also looking for another publisher. Even a high-profile hire such as Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has only been given enough resources to finish his game, and according to reports, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't even want to pay for its marketing anymore</a>.</p>
