			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a paywalled report on what's next for Warner Bros. Games, and the article includes updates on the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>The historic development studio of games like Shogo, No One Lives Forever, The Matrix Online, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the two Middle-earth: Shadow titles announced the game during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2021. Over three years have passed since, though, and we haven't seen anything more than that teaser trailer, nor do we know anything concrete other than the fact it will be an origin story featuring the Nemesis system that Monolith Productions designed for its most recent games.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's sources, that is because the development of the Wonder Woman project has been troubled, leading to its reboot in early 2024 under a new director. The report also alleges that Warner Bros. Games already spent over $100 million on the game, which makes sense as it's been nearly eight years after the launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Despite all this time and resources spent on it, Wonder Woman is nowhere near ready and will still take years to be released, if that can even happen, according to the report.</p>
<p>This doesn't bode well for the publisher, which had to deal with several blunders after the explosive success of Hogwarts Legacy. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flopped</a>, and, as many had assumed, Schreier confirms Rocksteady is returning to its safe haven of making single player Batman games. However, a new game will take years to be developed. Then there's MultiVersus, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shutting down on May 30</a> after its fifth season.</p>
<p>All these problems led to Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad's <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent departure</a>. The publisher is now reportedly facing a 'thin' release schedule in the near future, as most of the next triple-A projects will take time to be crafted. For example, following the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is said to be helping on the Wonder Woman game while also putting together a pitch for a Game of Thrones game.</p>

			<p>A new rumor suggests that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X might be announced very soon. The info was first shared by Rainbow Six Siege leaker<span>fraxiswinning</span>, who <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1887653415683035289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><em>Take everything with a large amount of salt when we talk about ‘Siege X’. Everything is speculative. Nothing is confirmed. </em><em>All we know is ‘Siege X exists’. We’ve been told by sources that it will be revealed at the SI. Things can change. </em></p>
<p><em>Seen some people say Siege X is CODENAMED Siege X. To clarify, It was originally named as ‘Modernized Siege’, traces of it popped up ~5 Months ago. It was renamed to ‘Siege X’ - 4 Months ago. Siege X is the final name.</em></p>
</div>
<p>According to the same source, this will be an engine overhaul and a graphical upgrade for textures and models, making it more of a remaster rather than a full-fledged sequel. Even so, it's been nearly ten years after the launch of Rainbow Six Siege, and a lot of fans have been clamoring for a technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The announcement is expected to happen next week, during the playoffs of the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/competition/468/14920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Invitational 2025 eSports tournament</a>. This is also where the developers will share other info, such as the new operator for Year 10 - Season 1. According to the leaker, the operator is from New Zealand, codenamed Curtain and named Rauora. The leaker also shared the codename for the operator that will be added with Year 10 - Season 3: Heist.&nbsp;Supposedly, Rainbow Six Siege X might launch during Year 10 - Season 2, which should be released in a few months.</p>
<p>As mentioned by the leaker, take the announcement info with a grain of salt, as publisher Ubisoft could always hold back the news until a later time. However, the veracity of the project itself seems to have been indirectly confirmed by Game Designer Justin Loranger-Ahluwalia, who <a href="https://x.com/trichotome/status/1887681661833277838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a long X thread against leaks, asking leakers to 'do something better with their lives' rather than what they've been doing so far.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-%E2%80%93-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions.1103022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II doesn't really want to make things easy for the player, featuring some unique gameplay systems that require full understanding to take advantage of them and some other systems that may feel a little dated, such as a saving system that requires you to use a specific item, Savior Schnapps potions, to save the game at any time while away from Henry's bed. As the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios is all about making choices and living with their consequences, such a saving system makes quite a bit of sense to prevent any sort of save scumming.</p>
<p>For some players, however, having to use items to access a very basic functionality like saving the game anywhere is a big no. Thankfully, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II features some workarounds to this issue that are accessible on both PC and consoles and are, overall, rather convenient.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207125020_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Things are obviously easier on PC, as there's a mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlimited Saving II</a> that allows you to save anytime without using Savior Schnapps potions. Better yet, using this mod doesn't disable Achievements if you're into collecting them, so there's really no reason not to use this mod if you don't like the vanilla game's saving system.</p>
<p>On consoles, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II makes it a little harder to cheat the saving system, but not by much. As you probably already know, the game's main menu features a Save and Quit option that allows you to quit the game at any time without losing progress. This option can easily be abused to actually save at any time, as the game doesn't delete your save file as it gets loaded. The only downside to this is that you will have to go through the loading screen again, but this isn't a major problem on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles, as load times are very fast, and you will only have to wait a few seconds before diving back in. Using this saving method is extremely good for beginners who never played the original game, as it allows them to experiment with the game's many somewhat obscure mechanics without risking losing tons of progress due to the vanilla's hardcore saving system.</p>
