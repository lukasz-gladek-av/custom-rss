			<p>The Last of Us Part I patch 1.1.4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/503940938959159952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released on PC</a> last Friday. It fixes a few issues and adds support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-announced-frame-generation-on-dlss-xess-upscaling-solutions-improved-image-quality-40-game-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 3.1 Super Resolution</a> and Frame Generation. AMD FSR 3.0 was added to the game back in March 2024, and this new patch updates it to the latest version (ahead of the planned <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-support-to-feature-in-all-titles-compatible-with-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 4</a>, which will, however, be exclusive to the new Radeon graphics cards).</p>
<p>As a reminder, FSR 3.1's main improvements are improved temporal stability, which causes less flickering and/or shimmering and fuzziness around moving objects, a reduction in ghosting, and better detail preservation. The big addition, though, is frame generation, which will undoubtedly provide a frame rate boost in The Last of Us Part I.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Super Resolution</em></li>
<li><em>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>[Hometown]&nbsp;Fixed rendering issue that could appear on TVs when using NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR</em></li>
<li><em>[The University]&nbsp;Fixed issue that could occur when interacting with a generator while enemies were still present</em></li>
<li><em>[Bus Depot] Fixed issue where Joel's flashlight would turn on when inspecting certain artifacts despite being in direct sunlight</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Fixed Text to Speech issue where "M" key was not being read when assigned to a function</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Naughty Dog is about to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC</a> in just over two months. Hopefully, the game will include all the features that were added to The Last of Us Part I with patches, such as AMD FSR 3.1. Fans are also hoping for better day-one optimization across the board since that was one of the main criticisms levied against the port made by Iron Galaxy and Nixxes Software. People also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-pc-patch-1-0-1-5-crashes-issues-remain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced a lot of crashes and other issues</a>, like huge shared loading times, early on.</p>

			<p>On Thursday, Amplitude Studios revealed the eagerly awaited ENDLESS Legend 2 at Amplified 25. This is a long-awaited return to an award-winning fantasy strategy series that takes place in the <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/">ENDLESS Universe</a>. This time, players will be taken to a mysterious world called Saiadha, where they'll discover new, unique factions that carry out specific playstyles and a detailed story to go along with it. ENDLESS Legend 2 is set to release in Early Access on PC in early 2025. There isn't a specific date for this just yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="ENDLESSâ„¢ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saiadha is an oceanic world with a constantly changing landscape thanks to tumultuous seasons that cause dramatic tidefalls that cause significant changes to the landscape around you. However, the water will come down as the seasons cycle, and the environment can be explored. The landscape may also provide as an obstacle during this time, thanks to the terrain changes made by the water. This will mean players will have to be strategic in their gameplay in order to contend with the dramatic shifts, as well as uncovering the secrets of this world, and the threats that come along with it.</p>
<p>Players' choices will matter in this game and can lead to detrimental consequences depending on the decisions made. You'll be able to conquer new territories, gain experience, and form long-lasting bonds with allies, as well as points of contention with rivals. When the game launches in Early Access, there will be four unique factions for players to play with, as well as two more being added when the game fully releases.</p>
<p>For those who are eager to get into ENDLESS Legend 2, you can sign up for the Insiders Program, which allows a select group of players to try out ENDLESS Legend 2 before the game officially releases in Early Access. This will allow the players to provide feedback to the developers about what changes need to be made. It's important to note that when you sign up to the Insiders Program, you will be under NDA, and will require a Steam link with Amplifiers, which is the <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/959-endless-legend-2-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community platform</a> that Amplitude Studios uses.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that you'll be accepted for the program, but it does mean that you will be considered for future testing opportunities should they arrive.</p>
<p>Will you be playing ENDLESS Legend 2 when it releases?</p>

			<p>After working on World of Warcraft for 14 years, some of the developers have jumped ship to create their own game with a brand new fantasy setting of their own. This title is Legacy: Steel and Sorcery, a game that was one of the top games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> last year. For those who have already tried it out during Steam Next Fest and enjoyed it, you won't have to wait much longer. The game is set to release in<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Early Access</a> on February 12, 2025.</p>
<p>The title combines class-core multiplayer RPG progression and crafting with MMO PvP to create an Extraction title that stands out from the crowd. It also uses a 3rd person perspective, so you'll be able to see your character in full glory when taking part in the action. The game takes place in a high fantasy world full of ogres, rogues, magicians, and warriors.&nbsp; It's been said that this title has been in development long before the Extraction genre took off, but it will still be able to stand on its own two feet as something unique and enjoyed by those who play it.</p>
<p>Although it's a multiplayer game, you have the option to play solo or play as a group of three and create your own parties, where you will then explore the expansive world of Mithrigarde. While there will be a lot of combat along the way, your main task in Legacy: Steel and Sorcery is to get your hands on forgotten treasures, scavenge for supplies, and get back to base without losing any of it. Of course, it won't be as easy as it sounds, as there are tons of monsters to fight off and other teams to fight off to be able to get back with your treasure.</p>
<p>There will be the classic traits of an MMO PVP game, such as looting, battle, leveling, exploring, and, of course, PvP combat. If this game sounds like something you're interested in, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of the fantasy action you could get into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy: Steel and Sorcery - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TKQaN0YNOE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Founding players will be able to help provide beneficial feedback to the developers and have helped come up with new classes, maps, and game modes that will be added at a later date. This includes a Wizard and Paladin class.</p>
<p>When the game releases in Early Access on February 12, 2025, the game will cost those who want to purchase it a reasonable $24.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Legacy: Steel and Sorcery?</p>

			<p>PC gaming has dominated the mainstream markets over the past decade, as revealed in this <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">new report</a> by Epyllion. Traditionally, video game markets have always favored console platforms in terms of product launches, given that the PC version often comes years after the mainstream release, but despite this disparity, it seems like PC gaming has managed to compete in the gaming segment tremendously. Epyllion's newest report has revealed that PC gaming consumer revenue share has grown by up to 20% in years, while console revenue has "stagnated," showing the interest around both platforms.</p>
<p>The data reveals that while both platforms have seen exponential growth over the years, it seems like PC gaming has seen a stronger momentum, which has certainly been reflected in the revenue figures. Since the last decade, PC gaming has been said to bring in up to 220% higher revenue than the console platform, which is indeed astonishing, considering how the general notion is that consoles have contributed more to the gaming industry in general.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Epyllion</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epyllion claims that the platform's growth over the years is due to its "compounding advantages" over the console platform and a more interactive environment, which means backward compatibility and greater control over the gaming performance of the respective systems. Along with this, the sluggish selling momentum of consoles has also been attributed to the figures, which is why PC gaming has seen accelerated progress over the past few years, especially after 2021.</p>
<p>Whatever platform emerges at the top, it's safe to say that this progress is ultimately healthy for the gaming markets since the revenue figures rising over the years mean we are witnessing sustainable growth. Let us know which platform you prefer, PC or console, and why.</p>
