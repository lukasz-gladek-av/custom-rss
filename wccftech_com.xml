			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios has released Elder Scrolls Online Update 44 on PC and Mac (console users will have to wait until November 13). As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a>, this free update is highlighted by a major overhaul of the Battlegrounds, the game's version of instanced PvP.</p>
<p>If you've played the MMORPG before, you're probably aware that Battlegrounds was a 4v4v4 affair, mimicking the Alliance War between Daggerfall Covenant, Aldmeri Dominion, and Ebonheart Pact on a smaller scale. The three-way fight offered a lot of dynamic and unpredictable situations; however, Battlegrounds remained strictly a casual affair ever since their introduction back in 2017 with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind Chapter</a>. This is all changing with Update 44, which tweaks Battlegrounds to 4v4 and 8v8 formats with players split between two factions.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online developers have designed seven brand new PvP maps, of which four are available in the 8v8 format and three in the 4v4 format. The 8v8 Battlegrounds will feature the full breadth of modes (Capture the Relic, Team Death Match, Domination, Chaos Ball, and Crazy King) as well as power-ups scattered throughout the map to make things more hectic. The 4v4 Battlegrounds are limited to just Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Crazy King. However, they include exclusive features like Rounds, Lives, and Spectator Camera.</p>
<p>Round matches are best of three and last five minutes each round. Some matches have lives, and they are displayed in the top right corner of the player's HUD (Heads-Up Display). Lives are per person, not per team. If you run out of lives, you will not be able to respawn any longer in that match. The Spectator Camera will only work in matches where there are lives, and you can only watch members of your team who are still alive. Moreover, the 4v4 Battlegrounds also have a competitive leaderboard which is based on the medals earned in each match.</p>
<p>Both formats have added Tiebreakers to the scoring system. If a match ends with both teams tied, the match will be decided by medals won and remaining lives for tiebreakers. In the rare case of a 'true tie' on all other metrics, both teams will be considered not winning but also not losing for reward purposes. Lastly, the old 4v4v4 game mode will no longer be available in Elder Scrolls Online for queues, but it may return in the future for limited times during special mini-PvP events.</p>
<p>The oft-neglected Imperial City PvPvE zone has had some improvements in this patch, too. Imperial City keys and key fragments have been converted to Imperial Fragments, and vault treasure chests have become vendors. Furthermore, many of the area's existing vendors have enjoyed upgrades to their wares, including their quality and selection.</p>

<p>Update 44 also adds two new Companions to Elder Scrolls Online: the High Elf outcast Tanlorin and the Khajiit Necromancer Zerith-var, which come with unique passive abilities and questlines. These companions are available for free for ESO Plus members, while everyone else may purchase them with the in-game Crowns. ESO Plus members also get a 10% boost to PvP Alliance Points earned, PvP Skill Line ranks, Alliance rank, and Tel Var Stones gained from killing monsters. The patch also sees new Homes, new Furnishings, new Skill Styles, new Scripts, and a new Grimoire.</p>
<p>Last but not least, HDR is finally supported on PC (provided you have an HDR display) with extensive tweaking options: HDR Mode, HDR Peak Brightness, HDR Scene Brightness, HDR Scene Contrast, HDR UI Brightness, and HDR UI Contrast.

			<p>Even when it was released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was never a powerhouse hardware, but with some overclocking, the system is capable of achieving impressive scores in some benchmark tests and even running the Dolphin GameCube emulator reasonably well.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> conducted another extreme overclocking test on L4T Ubuntu, effectively putting the Tegra X1 chip on steroids. This made the system achieve some impressive scores in tests such as Membench, Cuda95, and Geekbench 6. The fully overclocked system also runs the Dolphin GameCube/Wii emulator surprisingly well, achieving more than playable framerates at 1080p resolution in Mario Kart Wii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Extreme OC Benchmark on L4T Ubuntu - (Geekbench/glmark2/Dolphin)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRogKHSt5ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the past few months, we got a glimpse of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of doing with overclocking, thanks to a few other tests. One of them proved how an overclocked system modded with<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/"> 8GB of RAM</a> is capable of running<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-above-60-fps/"> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at above 60 FPS at native resolution and even at 30 FPS at 1440p</a>. If the rumors circulating online are correct, the console's successor shouldn't have much trouble running current games with good performance and great image quality, at least in its first few years of availability, thanks to 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which should allow developers to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S</a>, and NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-for-december-soulframe-preludes-pre-alpha-access-more.1021176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes treated the audience to a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-182-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double Devstream</a> for Warframe and Soulframe, and those interested heard a lot of big news about the titles. The streams provided a lot of information about the franchise and started with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/">huge reveal</a> of Warframe: 1999, being released in December. A 1999 prequel webcomic will be released in November to get fans excited for the upcoming release. Additionally, Xaku Prime Access will begin on November 13.</p>
<p>Xaku is an amalgamation of three forgotten Warframes and is now converging once again. They previously acted as beneficiaries of the Entrati family and were lost to the void. Now they are emerging as Xaku Prime, and two new Prime weapons will also be released alongside them. A Syandana and Operator suit will also be released along with Xaku on November 13.</p>
<p>The comic has been produced in partnership with community artist Karu, and explores the founding of the Hex Syndicate. Additionally, there will be a playable mini-game in the Hollvanian Mall hub, where you can experience a "90s era run n' gun side-scroller," which was developed with Sumo Digital. You'll also be able to customize the Atomicycle with multiple color schemes and 11 upcoming premium skins to make your mode of transport flashy and exciting on the streets of Hollvania.</p>
<p>Trinity and Nyx will be receiving light reworks to make their gameplay experience more enjoyable, with Trinity's passive ability being replaced with other buffs to her other abilities to help make her meta-viable. This comes ahead of their Protoframe appearance in Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The team behind Soulframe provided an update, stating that the Preludes testing access will open up widely in 2025, which will give players a look into the pre-Alpha state of the game. The Devstream also provided new insight into the game, stating that the Preludes invites are continuing to be sent out, with the team continuing to provide access to players. Each player that gets invited to the playtest will get four additional codes that they can share with friends and family so that they don't have to experience the game on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, additional changes to the combat system was mentioned, as well as the ability to acquire skills via weapon usage, changes to player progression, crafting and visual upgrades to the environments that players will get to explore.</p>
<p>During this devstream, they also honored one of the most prominent figures in the Warframe development team, Mike 'Mynki' Brennan. He was the first Art Director for Warframe, and helped provide great designs to the franchise and made Warframe the iconic IP that it is today. You can read his <a href="https://www.digitalextremes.com/news/remembering-mike-mynki-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full obituary</a> on the Digital Extremes website, where they dedicate Warframe: 1999 to him.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Has Drawn in Most Traffic Ever For a Game Launch in the UK]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't a surprise that people would be excited for the new Call of Duty game, as the franchise has been a mainstay in the gaming industry for years. To celebrate the launch, Activision has put a lot of work into the marketing for the game, and it's claimed by the UK network EE and BT that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has drawn the largest traffic ever for a game launch in the country. If this is true, this is a huge milestone for the franchise and for Activision, but it also doesn't come as much of a surprise, considering how much Activision spent on marketing for this game.</p>
<p>What does come as a surprise is the peak for the number of players flocking to their PC and Consoles wasn't on the day of launch for the game; instead, it was October 21, which is when everyone who pre-ordered it would be able to pre-load the game ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is also a huge game, as it's the first game to be available on Xbox Game Pass as a day-one release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone are also available to those who have Game Pass Ultimate. <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/10/black-ops-6-drives-biggest-ever-uk-gaming-traffic-on-ee-and-bt-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to ISPreview</a>, EE / BT saw a 144% increase in Xbox Live traffic on the broadband network compared to the week before. This is quite a monumental amount of traffic, but it isn't too surprising, as Call of Duty games are known for having huge download sizes. While there were reports that the game would be a whopping 300 GB, it isn't that big, thankfully. However, the game does still come in at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">sizable 102 GB</a> for pre-load,&nbsp; which, for a lot of people, will take a lot of time to install. Because of this, it makes perfect sense that the traffic for the game would increase so heavily on the pre-load day, as no one wants to be waiting around on release day trying to install a game at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any official figures released on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been performing since release, but it has only been a couple of days thus far. It will be interesting to see the metrics for the number of players who come from Game Pass, as it is a significantly cheaper way to access the game than paying for the title outright, something that isn't an option for many gamers.</p>
