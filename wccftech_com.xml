			<p>It's officially February, which means that we're finally within the release month for <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>. The new mainline entry in the long-running horror franchise looks like it could be one of the series' best, if it's able to strike the right balance between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">its <strong>RE2</strong> and <strong>RE7</strong>-inspired sections featuring <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong> and its <strong>RE4</strong>-inspired sections</a> with the iconic <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/">Leon Kennedy</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be arriving on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <strong>February 27, 2026,</strong> and ahead of that release date, developer <strong>Capcom</strong> has shared a new short film to get players in the mood for the new entry, and to further play on one of the new features the game will include, namely the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-more-unpredictable-than-ever/"><strong>zombies will retain</strong> some of their human memories and actions.</a></p>



<p>The three-and-a-half-minute short film titled "<em>Evil Has Always Had a Name</em>" stars Longlegs actor <strong>Maika Monroe</strong>, and as one viewer put it, it is "<em>better than most RE movies</em>." The film follows a mother and daughter living in Raccoon City ahead of the outbreak that RE2 centers on. It ends with a heartbreaking shot of the mother, now a zombie, visiting her daughter's grave with a photo of them in her hands.</p>

<p>She's shot by an unidentified patrol group clearing out zombies in the area, but it's clear that her visit is meant to emulate what we've already seen in trailers for Requiem, with zombies repeatedly carrying out actions they did in their human lives.</p>



<p>It's an emotional short that really sets the mood and tone for Resident Evil Requiem, and serves as a tragic reminder that when you're facing off against zombies in Requiem as either Grace or Leon, they were all people once, with their own lives, families, and loved ones.  If the storytelling in the game is able to carry the same emotional weight this short film does, then we're in for an incredible horror experience when Requiem arrives on February 27.</p>



<p>Even before its official release, Requiem is setting up Capcom for a strong year. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">a strong third-quarter financial report for the company (save for the sales of <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> compared to its predecessor)</a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shares-soar-great-sales-forecast-resident-evil-requiem/">company's shares rose by 10%,</a></strong> with strong forecasting thanks to Resident Evil Requiem's imminent arrival, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> coming up in March 2026.</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">got the chance to check out Requiem during Gamescom 2025</a>, Wccftech's Francecsco De Meo noted that the demo he played "<em>did an excellent job showcasing its survival horror mechanics and how technological advancements will enhance a fairly classic experience</em>." Requiem also made the list for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Wccftech's Most Anticipated Horror Games in 2026</a></strong> and our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-return-of-aaa/">Most Anticipated Games of 2026</a></strong> overall.</p>

			<p>Following a string of successful releases, Bethesda has struggled to deliver the same level of quality it did with <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></a></em>. Although <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong></em> has received <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/"><strong>significant improvements</strong></a> since its launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong><em>Starfield</em></strong></a> has yet to receive the same treatment, as, aside from some minor improvements and additional content, the latest open-world RPG from the studio is essentially still <strong>the same game it was at launch in late 2023.</strong></p>



<p><span>Though it is undeniable that the game feels&nbsp;<strong>a little dated</strong>&nbsp;compared to other modern open-world role-playing games, the Skyrim design lead thinks Starfield would have been&nbsp;<strong>received</strong>&nbsp;much better if it were put out by <strong>another studio</strong>, without the burden of very high expectations</span>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout"><strong>PressBox PR</strong></a>, Skyrim's design lead Bruce Nesmith was asked about the incredibly high expectations many have for <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls 6</strong></a></em> and the inevitable<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/"><strong>Fallout 5</strong></a></em>, and how the "<em>game of expectations"</em> may <strong>impact</strong> the perception of both games.</p>



<p><em>"I am very fond of a phrase called the game of expectations, and I've been trotting the game of expectations out for well over a decade. Bethesda's in the bad position of having expectations being so high they cannot be met,"</em> said Nesmith. "<em>Managing expectations is the number one thing a good marketing department has to do. Let's take a look at Starfield. Let's assume that a new studio had put out Starfield. I suspect it would be talked about like the second coming. But because it was released by Bethesda, the expectations were so much higher that it was seen differently. Starfield is a good game. It's a very good game. It's just not the game that people expected it to be."</em></p>



<p>Although Bethesda lost this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"game of expectations" </em>with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em>, the studio is in a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> better position</strong> for both<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> The Elder Scrolls 6</em> and<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fallout 5</em>, as, according to Nesmith, the high expectations for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Skyrim</em> coming from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion</em> (whose remake proved successful enough on all formats, although <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/around-half-of-oblivion-remastered-players-on-ps5-played-for-less-than-15-hours-nostalgia-is-powerful-but-only-so-much/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nostalgia didn't translate into great player engagement</strong></a>) and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 4</em> were fully met. However, it won't be easy: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Boy, do they have their work cut out for them,"</em> Nesmith said, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">agreeing</strong> with former Bethesda Lead Artist Nate Purkeypile about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>challenges the sixth entry in The Elder Scrolls series will face.</strong></a></p>



<p>While <em>Starfield</em> has not met the high expectations of Bethesda's fans, the game reportedly has <strong>a shot to do so</strong> with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>rumored massive update</strong></a>. Allegedly launching this year when the game will hit PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, this "Cyberpunk 2.0 style" update will <strong>address some of the most common complaints</strong>, such as load screens, improved space flight, and more.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to <strong>make players return</strong> to a game that had a lot of potential that was ultimately squandered by a series of questionable game design choices? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Players in the United States have <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">GameStop</a></strong>, players in Canada have <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/"><strong>EB Games</strong>,</a> and players in the UK have <strong>GAME</strong> as their major gaming-dedicated retailers. Or at least, UK players did have GAME, as the retailer is set to close its last three remaining standalone GAME stores after it made creditors aware it would be entering administration, the UK phrase for declaring bankruptcy.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> reported that GAME had entered administration, a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-has-happened-to-game-the-game">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-retailer-game-is-closing-its-remaining-standalone-stores-after-entering-administration/">VGC</a>) a few days later identified that the last three standalone GAME stores in the UK would be closed, as the company is once again on the brink of collapsing. It'll still operate its website, and players in the UK will still be able to visit locations that operate within larger Frasers Group-owned entities as concession stands, but it will no longer have standalone brick-and-mortar storefronts.</p>



<p>The British gaming retailer was acquired by the Frasers Group back in 2019, and over the years, the company has been cutting down on its services, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">ending trade-ins in January 2024</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-reportedly-dropping-in-store-pre-orders-next-month">ending in-store pre-orders in July 2024</a>. And in between those changes, it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-game-braced-for-redundancies">laid off a "<em>majority</em>" of staff in April 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Ending pre-orders and trade-ins may be unique to GAME, but retailers dedicated to games across the world have suffered store closures and layoffs, including the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">GameStop</a> and EB Games. Plenty of players still buy their titles physically, but most are buying them on the digital storefronts available on their device, whether that's Steam, the PlayStation Store, the Xbox Store or the Nintendo eShop.</p>



<p>The writing has been on the wall for retailers dedicated to gaming for years now, and with GAME set to close its remaining standalone stores, it's the closing of a chapter in the business of video games. Still, back in 2023, the company's managing director, <strong>Nick Arran</strong>, denied that it would be turning away from selling video games to focus instead on selling toys and other physical items.</p>



<p>"<em>Gaming is our core business and we will be last man standing selling physical video games</em>," Arran said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of video games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas. But we need to be realistic. We have a business to run and the expectation is this will decline. So we need to fill that gap</em>."</p>



<p>Three years later, it's tough to see the British retailer as the "<em>last man standing</em>" as a gaming-dedicated store if it doesn't have any stores around. Its concessions will continue, but if the company keeps declining, those may be gone sooner than later as well.</p>
