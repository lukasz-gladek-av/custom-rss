			<p>As excited as we all were to see the new features and specs for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and, of course, the games that Nintendo has in store for it, the price of the console was always going to be the biggest talking point coming out of Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Which it certainly has been, due to just how high the price ended up being. $449.99 USD (or $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>) was not what gamers around the world wanted to read. Unless you happen to live in Japan, however, since Nintendo also revealed it will be selling a cheaper, Japan-only Switch 2 that's region-locked.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">VGC</a>, the 'Japanese-Language System' version of the Switch 2 will be available at <strong>49,980 yen</strong>, which works out closer to&nbsp;<strong>$334 USD.&nbsp;</strong>The version of the Switch 2 that supports multiple languages, which is the one everyone outside of Japan will be buying, will cost <strong>69,980 yen</strong>.</p>
<p>If you plan on going to Japan sometime after June 5, 2025, and have no trouble reading and understanding Japanese, then it's not entirely clear if you could purchase one of these consoles at the cheaper, Japan-only price, and take it back to your home country and continue to enjoy it there.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">reports</a> that the console will only be "<em>linkable to [Nintendo] accounts with their country/region set to Japan,</em>" so, presumably, as long as you meet that requirement (and again, can read and understand Japanese), you could get the Switch 2 for more than $100 less than you would have otherwise paid. Though surely the trip to Japan, or shipping the Japanese-only Switch 2 out of the country to wherever you live, will fill that gap quickly enough.</p>
<p>As to why Nintendo is adopting this two-tiered pricing model for Japan only, Ahmad has a few common-sense theories.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">To discourage reselling of the new system by foreign buyers who leverage the console’s lower price point in the country to resell the title to regions with a higher price – an issue faced by the first Nintendo</span></em> Switch," Ahmad writes.</p>
<p>He also adds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">regarding the tariffs</a> announced by the United States and Donald Trump on Wednesday, that the difference in pricing between Japan and the United States particularly, is "<em>likely a calculated move on Nintendo’s part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions</em>."</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">Japan accounted for nearly 25% of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain</span></em> <em>momentum</em>," he continues.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.</span></em>"</p>
<p>At least Ahmad does end on a more positive note, saying that he does not believe Nintendo will raise the price of the console within the first five years of its lifetime.</p>

			<p>The full Monster Hunter Wilds 1.010.00.00 patch notes have been revealed, confirming the new content and changes coming to the latest entry in the series ahead of the patch's release in a few hours.</p>
<p>Besides highlighting the return of series' classic monster Mizustune, its Tempered variant, and the Zoh Shia high rank hunt, <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.010.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the patch notes</a> revealed some previously unknown balance changes, which include the increase in guild points rewards for investigations, the increase of points required for Wyverian Melding and Meld Decorations functions at the Melding Pot, and Mantles rebalancing, including the previously announced nerfing of the Corrupted Mantle.</p>
<p>Among the changes to weapons, most have been left untouched, except for the Lance, which receives a change that makes it easier to land thrust attack finishers after a focus strike, and the Bow, which sees nerfs to Dragon Piercer and buffs to Power Volley and Thousand Dragons, among other things. Sadly, the patch notes don't reveal any unexpected performance improvements, other than the VRAM usage improvements and upgraded DirectStorage version confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/">last week.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The physical release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> won't require an additional download to run, as the entire game will be included in the cart.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, CD Projekt Red's Vice President of Business Jan Rosner confirmed the game will ship on a 64 GB cart that includes both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, so no additional download will be required to run the game. The game will launch the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide for the price of $69.99, €69.99.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on June 5th. SRP is $69.99/€69.99. The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>— Jan Rosner (@jan_rosner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jan_rosner/status/1907780644131799153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the time, we haven't seen much of Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition running on Nintendo Switch 2 besides the short trailer shown during yesterday's Nintendo Direct, but it seems like a high refresh rate experience is out of the cards, even in docked mode. Earlier today, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed, after a hands-on session, that the game runs at 40 FPS in Performance Mode with the console docked, which is definitely disappointing for those who expected a 60 FPS mode, but not completely unexpected, considering how demanding the game can be.</p>

<p lang="en">Some other Switch 2 observations:<br>
- The "Welcome Tour" app is surprisingly cool (one minigame reminded me of Mario Paint) and it is insane that Nintendo is charging for it<br>
- Metroid looks and feels fantastic<br>
- Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 40fps in performance mode while docked (oof)</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Confirmed to Support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Tracing]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing.1154103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rumors about the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware supporting NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing features have been circulating since 2023, based on the assumption that the underlying chipset would be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, Nintendo did not mention these features at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the Direct</a> or in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent article</a> posted on the official website. After the showcase, the folks at Digital Foundry went through the released footage of Nintendo Switch 2 games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there was no indication of NVIDIA DLSS being featured in those games, casting further doubts on what seemed like a certainty.</p>
<p>Now, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has got Nintendo on the record about the subject</a>. Takuhiro Dohta, senior director at Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Division and one of three people seen in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, revealed:</p>
<p><em>We use DLSS upscaling technology and that's something that we need to use as we develop games. And when it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K. Whether the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, the GPU does support ray tracing. As with DLSS, I believe this provides yet another option for the software developers to use and a tool for them.</em></p>
<p>When IGN tried to obtain further details about the GPU included in the Nintendo Switch 2, Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo's Technology Development Division and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, replied that Nintendo does not like to discuss the finer technical details. However, Sasaki-san added that NVIDIA should share more information&nbsp;at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Based on previously rumored information, the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU should be powered by NVIDIA's Ampere architecture and feature 2048 CUDA Cores, while its 8-core CPU should include 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores. Earlier this year, a leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Switch 2 is capable of 1.71 TFLOPS in handheld mode with a GPU clocked at 561 MHz, while the docked mode (which, as Nintendo has confirmed, is boosted by a fan this time around) can go up to 3.1 TFLOPS thanks to the higher GPU speed of 1000 MHz.</p>
<p>We'll find out if these leaks were correct soon enough.</p>
