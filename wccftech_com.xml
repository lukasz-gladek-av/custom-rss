			<p>A new year means another entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry’s flagship wrestling franchise</a>, and today 2K Games unveiled WWE 2K25. After a few years of relatively conservative updates, it seems like developer Visual Concepts is going all out with WWE 2K25, which adds a new island hub you can explore with up to 50 other players, a Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase mode, and a roster of over 300 Superstars, with no restrictions on who can fight who – yes, intergender wrestling is in. You can check out the first teaser trailer for WWE 2K25, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OTC is ready for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWE2K25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWE2K25</a>! ☝️☝️☝️ <a href="https://t.co/tx4p6Fj9Ks">pic.twitter.com/tx4p6Fj9Ks</a></p>
<p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href="https://twitter.com/WWE/status/1884080756705685505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And here’s a look at the game’s covers and some early screenshots…</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 most standout new feature will likely be The Island, an online hub similar to ones seen in NBA 2K for years, in which you can interact with other players and complete various challenges. Interestingly, The Island will feature its own storyline, in which you vie to impress Roman Reigns that's completely separate from the usual MyRise story mode (which is still in the game). The Island will be exclusive for the current-gen Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game (it seems PC players will have to sit the feature out).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Bloodline Rules Showcase will open things up somewhat, offering three different types of matches – ones that let you relive history, ones that let you change history, and dream matches that never got to occur in real life. Want to know how a historic Bloodline member like Yokozuna might match up against the current roster? Now you can.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K25…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Match Types and Gameplay Improvements:</strong> Intergender wrestling makes its long- awaited debut in the WWE 2K franchise! WWE or player-created Superstars from the men’s and women’s divisions can now compete against each other to set up limitless matchups across all game modes. Additional features include the return of Chain Wrestling, Bloodline Rules Match, Underground Match, and new barricade diving! More details on each new match type will be shared soon.</li>
<li><strong>MyGM Online Multiplayer:</strong> Intrepid GMs can take their show on the road and challenge general managers worldwide in the enhanced MyGM for WWE 2K25, now with online multiplayer for up to four players. Players draft WWE Superstars and Legends to their weekly show’s roster and lead their brand through multiple-week seasons with a bigger selection of General Managers, cross- brand Premium Live Events, and more.</li>
<li><strong>MyRise:</strong> Players guide their Superstar from the women’s or men’s division in a singular, multi-gender MyRise storyline where Bayley, Kevin Owens, and other Superstars infiltrate NXT in an attempt to take control of the entire WWE. Featuring new personality choices that lead to specific storylines, as well as brawl environments, unlockable arenas, characters, useable objects, and more, plus new ally storylines involving Jey Uso, Bianca Belair, Seth Rollins, and other Superstars.</li>
<li><strong>Universe:</strong> WWE 2Ks sandbox mode receives upgrades to give players greater control over their Universe experience, including the long-awaited return of Promos! The new system includes multiple promo types and outcomes with new cutscenes and branching choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like WWE 2K25 is looking to mix up the formula a bit -- following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious but steady improvement</a> over the past few years, we'll see if the gambit pays off. As usual, WWE 2K25 will come in an array of different editions, including the basic standard edition for $70 on both current and last-gen consoles, the $100 Deadman Edition, and the $130 Bloodline Edition. Everyone who pre-orders any edition gets the Wyatt Sicks Pack, which includes characters Uncle Howdy, Dexter Lumis, Nikki Cross, Joe Gacy, and Erick Rowan. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the Deadman and Bloodline Editions of the game…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadman Edition</strong> – “Deadman Edition Bonus Pack” which includes Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Undertaker and Original Undertaker (‘90) Persona Cards and playable Superstars, a useable Urn object, Undertaker ‘95 Mask cosmetic item for The Island, and Brother Love Manager, plus a Season Pass to all five post-launch DLC character packs and 15,000 VC.</li>
<li><strong>The Bloodline Edition</strong> - All bonus content included in the Deadman Edition, the Ringside Pass (Season Pass plus Superstar Mega-Boost), The Rock Nation of Domination Pack, which features a Rock Nation of Domination Persona card and playable Superstar, plus The Bloodline Edition Bonus Pack, which features Mattel Elite Series 114 Jey Uso and Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Roman Reigns Persona cards and playable Superstars. Also Family Above All Hoodie, OTC Shirt, Yeet tank Top and Yeet Sunglasses cosmetic items for The Island, while for Steam only, it includes an additional 32,500 VC. Also included is the WrestleMania 41 Pack which features the WrestleMania 41 Arena, two WrestleMania 41 Main Event Superstars Persona cards and playable Superstars, and a new Superstar Persona Card (TBA), which will all be available Summer 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWE 2K25 hits PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who drop the cash for the Deadman or Bloodline Editions can play a week early on March 7. Look forward to a Wccftech preview and review of WWE 2K25 over the coming weeks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Phantom Blade Zero Will Be Around 20, 30 Hours Long and Feature Four Difficulty Levels]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-30-hours-long/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-will-be-around-20-30-hours-long-and-feature-four-difficulty-levels.1093593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-30-hours-long/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero is looking to be much longer than the typical hack and slash games, judging from information revealed during some recent interviews.</p>
<p>As revealed on <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/9446196938?share=9105&amp;fr=sharewise&amp;see_lz=0&amp;share_from=post&amp;sfc=copy&amp;client_type=2&amp;client_version=12.60.1.2&amp;st=1737962073&amp;is_video=false&amp;unique=D7A94B34CF77EF0E45F70BE4B6253665#/">Chinese forums Tieba</a>, it has been revealed in a recent interview that the game in development by S-Game will require between 20 and 30 hours to complete the main story, with 20 hours of additional side content, which should make the game feel more in line with modern action role-playing games that pure action games that are typically much shorter. The game will also feature a total of four difficulty levels ranging from simple to extremely difficult, so the total play time will likely be higher for those who wish to be challenged or want to play through the game multiple times at different difficulty levels. No matter the difficulty, however, players will not have to completely restart boss battles upon defeat, as they will start again at the second phase if they reach it before being defeated.</p>
<p>Speaking about bosses, these recent interviews have also confirmed how Phantom Blade Zero will feature what sounds like a boss-rush mode where it will be possible to fight main campaign bosses again. This mode will also feature some hidden bosses, so it definitely sounds like the game will feature plenty of content. 30 main weapons and more than 20 secondary weapons will be available in the game, so combat should be pretty varied.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat mechanics, I feel S-Game already has them down well, as I really enjoyed the small slice of Phantom Blade Zero I played during<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/"> Gamescom 2024.</a> If traversal, level design, and encounter design are as good as the combat mechanics, the game has the potential to become one of the best action games ever released.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. You can check out the game's latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/">here</a>.</p>
