			<p><strong>GTA 6</strong> is the game that most of the industry has to deal with, one way or another. Its arguably unprecedented (but well deserved, given that GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time) hype means developers and publishers of all sizes are doing everything they can to steer clear of its launch date, which, however, has already shifted twice, disrupting many plans and <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening the very livelihood of certain companies</a>. It's a topic we covered often and in various nuances, including Goichi Suda's recent quip that his new game, Romeo Is a Dead Man, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'won the game of chicken against GTA 6'</a>.</p>



<p>What we weren't really expecting to cover is Rockstar's game attached to the flailing <strong>MMORPG</strong> genre. And yet, that's what we must do following the statement of an industry veteran. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our fresh, exclusive interview about the state of the MMORPG among Western developers</a>, <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whose career credits include titles like Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Doom (2016), New World, Halo Infinite, and Gotham Knights, revealed to have heard that many of GTA 6's planned features, if confirmed, would place it on a path to evolve into an MMORPG. </p>



<p>Here's the exact response we got from Vogel when we asked him (and other two MMO vets) whether there's still an audience for a big Western-made massively multiplayer online game:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. <strong>If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs</strong>.</em></p>



<p>Now, first of all, he's obviously referring to the online mode. While Rockstar hasn't shared any actual details about the game yet except for the setting and the identity of the protagonists, it's a fair bet that there will be a traditional, narrative-driven single player campaign and a separate online mode, just like with GTA 5.</p>



<p>Secondly, Vogel makes no mystery of the fact that he didn't actually work on the next Grand Theft Auto game, so this is second-hand information and should be treated as a rumor. Does it even make sense as an evolution of GTA Online in GTA 6, though?</p>



<p>We'd argue so. GTA 5 has already made a big step toward an online persistent world compared to GTA 4's more limited, session-based multiplayer, and its success was so massive that it overshadowed everything else at the studio, foregoing any need for story-based DLCs like GTA 4's The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, with new story beats instead deployed to GTA Online.</p>



<p>Moreover, a large hint that this might indeed be the direction Rockstar has taken is the studio's acquisition of <strong>FiveM</strong> maker Cfx.re <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in August 2023</a>. FiveM, a community-driven modification of GTA 5's base multiplayer, introduced MMORPG-like features such as dedicated servers, far higher player count per session, and the ability to roleplay as a specific role, like a paramedic, a police officer, and many more careers. FiveM became so popular that at one point, it surpassed the concurrent player count of regular GTA 5 Online multiplayer on Valve's Steam. It also significantly contributed to making GTA 5 a consistently high ranking category on streaming platforms like Twitch.</p>



<p>The continued popularity of FiveM shows that there is indeed an appetite for a more persistent, roleplay-inspired experience with larger player counts among the GTA community. Of course, it is unlikely that GTA 6's Online mode will be anything like traditional MMORPGs such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft or even ZeniMax's more recent The Elder Scrolls Online. However, it is entirely possible and even likely that it may incorporate some of their features to engage players in a more seamless, persistent, and immersive living world.</p>



<p>It may not be until well into next year before Rockstar Games shares any official details. Meanwhile, though, we'll keep our ears to the ground for more rumors and leaks about next year's most anticipated game. </p>

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Larian Studios' chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio is using GenAI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity</a>, the use of GenAI tech in video game development has roared back to the front of the line in the industry's discourse rolodex. Amidst the GenAI conversation Larian started, it appears that renowned creator Hideo Kojima also offered his perspective on GenAI in a recent interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/style/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-hnk-intl-dst">In an interview with CNN</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109413/kojima-wont-use-ai-to-create-art-thinks-it-could-be-useful-for-responsive-enemy-design/index.html">TweakTown</a> (that actually went live a few days before Bloomberg's interview with Vincke), Kojima, perhaps unsurprisingly, said that he's not exactly interested in using GenAI technology to create anything visual. He doesn't dismiss it entirely, though, as he says he's more interested in how it could be used within the "<em>control systems</em>" of a game than anything else.</p>



<p>"<em>Rather than having AI create visuals or anything like that, I'm more interested in using AI in the control systems</em>," Kojima began. "<em>For example, if you have 100 players, each of them will have their own habits and tendencies, their sense of control, how they move - all of that differs from person to person.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>By having AI compensate for those differences, the gameplay can gain more depth. And in most games, the enemies don't behave very much like real humans. But by using AI, enemy behavior could change based on the player's experience, actions, and patterns. That kind of dynamic response would make much deeper gameplay possible</em>."</p>



<p>The kind of AI Hideo Kojima is discussing here, particularly with enemy behaviors, is the kind that we are more than used to seeing in video games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/alien-isolation-is-way-too-long-because-its-xenomorph-got-way-too-smart-at-the-time-it-didnt-seem-that-long/">Alien: Isolation famously has an incredibly sophisticated enemy AI system built for the Xenomorph</a>, which was a key element of its gameplay that elevates it to being a truly terrifying horror game.</p>



<p>His statement to CNN is also in line <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">with the last time he was asked about GenAI</a>, where he said he'd use it for "<em></em><em>the tedious tasks</em>" while he handled all the actual art.</p>



<p>While some studios, Larian included, are comfortable using GenAI for art and visuals as part of the process, it seems clear that Kojima would much rather have it make the systems and the nitty-gritty elements of development run smoother, so he could focus on what he loves to do, and the thing that actually makes his games iconic.</p>
