			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">announced</a> that it will officially end its PlayStation Stars loyalty program. As of today, the program will not be accepting new members, and those already part of the program will see no new campaigns or rewards added and will no longer be able to earn points after July 23, 2025. Players who choose to leave at any point after today will not be able to rejoin the program and will lose all their points.</p>
<p>"<em>At Sony Interactive, we’re always experimenting with new and exciting ways to bring our community of players together to share the joys of gaming and create lasting memories,</em>" Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise at Sony, began on a PlayStation Blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>That’s why three years ago, we created PlayStation Stars, a loyalty program to celebrate our players. The unique program includes playing games to earn rewards – including our unique Digital Collectibles that pay homage to incredible games and our PlayStation legacy. The program has helped foster a deeper connection with fans around the world.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.</em>"</p>
<p>The loyalty program was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-introduces-playstation-stars-loyalty-program-brings-digital-collectible-rewards-and-loyalty-points/">announced and launched in 2022</a>, and the first reaction from players was that PlayStation Stars potentially began its life as an NFT program, but was pivoted into what we ended up with when PlayStation caught wind of how incredibly unpopular NFTs had become.</p>
<p>What ended up being the best part of the program was the fact that, for a while, it was possible to earn enough points to collect $25 and $5 worth of credit on the PlayStation Store. Players did everything they could to 'game' the system, and Sony took steps to rebalance how points were dolled out to curb those efforts.</p>
<p>Players who still have points they'd like to redeem will be able to do so until November 2, 2026.</p>
