			<p>Now that we're a few days removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a>, EA and its Battlefield Studios have had a chance to look at the results, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">based on the player counts we saw during the beta</a>, are unsurprisingly staggering. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-open-beta-debrief">According to EA</a>, the beta for Battlefield 6 drew in the most players for a beta in the series' history, with 420,127,450 matches played across 92,351,578 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>The beta also contained more content than any previous beta in the series' history, with multiple modes across four maps available for players to check out. 32% of all players deployed with the Assault class, 26% jumped in as Support, 23% as Engineer, and only 19% of players deployed with the Recon class.</p>



<p>Also, those 23% of players who were running Support were able to rack up 7,453,121 kills with defibrillators.</p>

<p>But EA is doing more than just tallying up statistics when looking back on the beta. It's also analyzing how players behaved during it, and taking in feedback given on the state of the game. As a result, a number of tweaks and adjustments are being made to multiple aspects of the game for its coming launch on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Starting with the maps, the collective teams at Battlefield Studios quickly noticed that players were taking advantage of flanking tactics that involved running out of bounds and quickly back into the fight, but behind enemy lines for a few easy kills. If you were one of the players who did this, hopefully you've had your fun, since EA is "<em>actively working on adjustments to prevent unintended access and ensure gameplay stays within the intended boundaries</em>."</p>



<p>Also, if you were concerned that the maps in the beta were too small, EA is reassuring that "<em>more fast-paced maps, larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package.</em>" It continues to say that for all players currently in its Battlefield Labs program, two new multiplayer maps will be tested soon in the lead up to October.</p>



<p>In terms of the weapons, while the beta didn't include the full range of the arsenal that will be available in Battlefield 6 at launch, Battlefield Studios is "<em>making targeted adjustments to deliver a more consistent and rewarding gunplay experience</em>," including tweaking recoil and tap-fire characteristics for all weapons, and the beast that was the M87A1 shotgun is no more, since it will require more than one-shot to get a kill moving forward.</p>



<p>Player movement is also getting reworked, with a reduction in horizontal speed and a greater penalty added for consecutive jumps. Accuracy has also been decreased while jumping and sliding, in order to "<em>make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, EA is taking a pass at player counts, especially in Rush mode, and playlist options, and in each section stresses that "<em>finding the right balance is an ongoing process</em>."</p>



<p>As far as next steps are concerned, the first players to see those will be the ones in the Battlefield Labs program, as EA is introducing "<em>in-game adjustments</em>" for upcoming events. Everyone else will have to wait until Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025 to see what's changed since the beta.</p>
