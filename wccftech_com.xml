			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnl-EMxfYE">Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025</a> event featured several of the games in the studio's portfolio, but it spent more time showing off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> latest free title update than it did anything else.</p>
<p>The second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will be available on <strong>Monday, June 30, 2025</strong>, adding two monsters to the hunt. The long-awaited Lagiacrus, and Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Capcom also revealed a roadmap for more updates coming later this year, with a seasonal event coming in July that'll last from July 23 to August 6, and a Arch-tempered monster, Uth Duna, that gets introduced on July 30 with its own equipment rewards and challenge questline. That'll run until August 20.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>On August 27, a Fender collaboration will arrive, letting players shred in between hunts, which will land just ahead of the third free title update, which is due to arrive sometime in&nbsp;<strong>late September 2025.</strong></p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched at the end of February 2025 and was instantly one of the best-selling games of 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">setting records for Capcom</a>. It's also arguably one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series, if not the best one so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">When Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, he said that Monster Hunter Wilds is "<em>the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series.</em>"</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to jump into Monster Hunter Wilds, but haven't had the chance yet, it's on sale for the first time this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">as part of the Steam Summer Sale 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025 event started off with a deep dive into <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">Pragmata</a>, showing off more of its hacking-shooting-puzzle gameplay and talking a little more in-depth about the story between the android girl Diana and Hugh Williams, an astronaut who ends up on the Moon as part of an investigative team trying to discover why this lunar base has gone silent.</p>
<p>Williams is described as a sometimes sarcastic, though kind man, while Diana is "<em>an android with a heart</em>" and a "<em>curious and enigmatic android</em>."</p>
<p>The combat system works in two parts. First, you'll always need Diana to 'hack' your enemy's armor, otherwise you won't do any damage. Once you've completed the short puzzle of connecting two green nodes on a five-by-five square while passing through as many blue nodes as you can, Hugh is then able to engage in the ranged third-person combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Every encounter in Pragmata is essentially a race at the beginning, with you trying to complete the puzzle before the enemy is able to slowly walk to you and do damage, while you try to finish the puzzle to stun them briefly and gain the upper hand. Once you're dealing with multiple enemies at a time, it's about managing who to take down first and how to keep them from overwhelming you quickly.</p>
<p>Graciously, you do also seem to have a solid maneuverability move set, with thrusters that are helpful in combat and when platforming around the lunar station.</p>
<p>We still don't have a proper release date for Pragmata, as the game is still set to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC,<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/"> sometime in 2026</a>. Capcom did however confirm that players will be able to try the game themselves if they're in attendance at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto got to try out Pragmata at this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/"> Summer Game Fest 2025 event</a>, and though it was just a short demo, Kai was already able to see the potential of the game's combat.</p>
<p>"<em>In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core.</em>"</p>

			<p>Capcom hosted its Spotlight Showcase 2025 event this evening and showcased new gameplay for several of its key upcoming games, including <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/news.html">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, due out next year on February 27, 2026.</p>
<p>Requiem was first revealed at the beginning of this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest 2025's</a> big showcase, with a cutscene that gave us a short look into the game's story, but not a look at gameplay.</p>
<p>While we didn't get a full gameplay deep-dive during the spotlight event, we did get a solid look at gameplay, which was featured between clips of members of the development team talking about different aspects of the game, such as their foundational concept of wanted to create a feeling of "<em>addictive horror</em>" and how challenging the team felt it was to bring players back to Raccoon City, because of how significant the city is in the series history.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom also dug a bit more into Grace Ashcroft, who they described as being more introverted and frightened than series regular Leon Kennedy would be in the same situations, wanting to create a character that would be closer to how the player feels while playing the game, unsure of what will happen around the next corner.</p>
<p>That said, Capcom clarified that she's still an FBI agent and is more than capable with a weapon. First-person gameplay was described as being more for players who want a horror-focused experience, while action-focused players ought to pick third-person.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant comments made by the team came from director Koshi Nakanishi, who explained a bit about why it's important for Capcom to be going back to Raccoon City in this game, and the significance of the game's title.</p>
<p>"<em>This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before. Resident Evil is a series that was born from Umbrella and the Raccoon City zombie outbreak. And we chose the title "Requiem" to mark a milestone in the series."</em></p>
