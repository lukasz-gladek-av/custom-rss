			<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, much like the original NES release and every other remake released over the years, features some very unique gameplay mechanics that have a rather big impact on character progression for every playable character. Among these is the Personality system, which the game uses to assign a personality to a character that determines stat growth on top of a class's natural growth.</p>
<p>You will be acquainted with this Personality system right at the beginning of the adventure. A mysterious voice will ask for your real name and birth date first before submitting you to a personality quiz, which involves a few questions picked at random among 43 possible questions. Depending on how you answer, you will be brought into an imaginary scenario where you will have to deal with one between eight different choices that will end up determining the personality of the Hero.</p>
<p>Given the huge number of possibilities and how the questions are picked out at random, it is difficult to aim for a certain personality. Depending on the questions and the final scenario, the Hero can belong to one of the 32 starting personalities. 13 other personalities are reserved for the companions.&nbsp; 28 of the 45 personalities can be assigned to any character using special items to give players more control over this unique gameplay system.</p>

<p>As for how the best personality in the entirety of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, the one that has the most benefits is the Vamp personality, formerly known as Sexy. This female-exclusive personality has a +70% stat bonus, allowing for great well-rounded characters that can be great at doing several different things and can take better advantage of the Vocation system that allows every character, with the exception of the Hero, to change classes once at Level 20 after having reached Alltrades Abbey a few hours into the adventure. Upon a class change, the level of the character is reset to 1 with all stats halved, but once a character that changed class levels up again, they will be more powerful than they were before the class change.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more specific builds that can take advantage of a class' unique abilities, there are some personalities that work better than others for all character types. For the Hero, who's made to be highly versatile, the Paragon personality works best for a physical attacker, Though Cookie for a tank with high physical defense, Wit for a spellcaster. Paragon and Tough Cookie work great for Warriors, while Lone Wolf, alongside Though Cookie, works great for the Martial Artist who wants to hit hard and fast. Mages, Priests, and Gadabouts that will turn into Sages benefit the most from Genius, although this personality could lead to a durability issue. Wit is a more balanced personality that provides good Wisdom growth without sacrificing durability too much. Thieves work well with Paragon for attack power and Tough Cookie for defense, depending on how you want to use them, although a physical attacker build works slightly better given their high agility growth that allows them to often attack before anyone else. Merchants leave a lot to be desired no matter their personality, so you could go with any and still have to deal with an average class that doesn't do anything particularly well. Learning a variety of different abilities, the new Monster Wrangler class is just as versatile as the Hero class, so the best personality depends on how you want to use the class. Paragon remains the best for a physically oriented build, and Wit for a spellcasting-oriented build.</p>

<p>While wrapping your head around the Personality system in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake can feel complicated at the start of the game, keep in mind that you can complete the adventure at any difficulty level using any party composition and with any personality. The system has been devised to give players almost complete control over their characters' growth and should be considered as a bonus mechanic rather than a fundamental one that has to be fully understood to complete the game. So, if you're not aiming to min-maxing, you can go with any personality or class and still have a great time.</p>
