			<p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida was interviewed by the website <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Developer</a> during the recent Gamescom LATAM event, where he spoke, among other things, about the different approaches that Microsoft and Sony have to gaming subscriptions like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Yoshida, who was president of Sony's Worldwide Studios group for eleven years (2008-2019) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the company in January,</a> called Microsoft's stance 'dangerous' for developers:</p>
<p><em>If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what type of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services. That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe the way Sony approached subscriptions is healthier. You know, not to overpromise and to allow people to spend money to buy the new games. After a couple of years, there won't be many people willing to buy those games at that initial price, so they'll be added to the subscription service, and there'll be more people to try those products in time for the next game in the franchise to come out.</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's unsurprising that he would align more with Sony's policy against adding day-one first-party games to subscriptions. However, it should be noted that Microsoft has stressed on many occasions that they have absolutely no intention of ever removing the customer's ability to purchase games separately from Game Pass. It was always designed as an additive way to engage, not a complete replacement of direct purchases.</p>
<p>Following his departure from Sony, Yoshida also talked about other topics. A few months ago, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> that the man who replaced him as the head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, isn't forcing any of the first-party studios to work on live service games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that he played quite a bit of Ghost of Yōtei before leaving Sony, and it's shaping up to be even better than Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Yōtei is now set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on October 2.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 systems are <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/">starting to appear out in the wild</a>, and one person who was able to get their hands on the system early has taken the liberty of showcasing what the whole setup process looks like when you first turn on your Switch 2, minus all the parts that don't work because the system doesn't have the day one patch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-%E2%80%94-first-setup-menu-walkthrough.1200999/">Russian YouTube channel</a> took the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y49k7XwfE6k&amp;t=4s">publishing a video</a> that goes through the entire setup process for the Nintendo Switch 2, with the volume maxed, so viewers can hear the intro music and everything else that goes on when setting up your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The video was quickly taken down, which is not surprising as Nintendo is likely trying to keep a lid on these leaks with the console's launch only days away. But not before Wccftech, and many others could check out the video and see that much hasn't changed when it comes to the console's home screen.</p>
<p>Even in the system's settings, you won't see many changes regarding the layout and the options available. Some things are new, like the option to bump resolutions on the TV that you connect your Switch 2 device to up to 4K, but much has stayed the same, including the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 only comes with two basic themes for the console: White and Black.</p>
<p>There's always the potential that more will be added, but that's what we thought when the original Switch launched in 2017. Eight years later, we still have two basic themes available.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what else has changed and what else has stayed the same with the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5, 2025, and it can be used with the day one patch downloaded.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Copilot for Gaming in beta testing for mobile devices (iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass.beta&amp;hl=en-US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>). The early preview can be found in the beta version of the Xbox mobile app in select countries:&nbsp;Albania, Algeria Moldova, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In Microsoft's words, Copilot for Gaming aims to be the 'ultimate sidekick' for gamers. Users can access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen without distractions from the core gameplay experience. The AI knows which game they're playing and understands their Xbox activity, so it can answer questions about games players are interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the player's account, play history, and achievements.</p>
<p>Example prompts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Hey Copilot, can you remind me what materials I need to craft a sword in Minecraft?”</em></li>
<li><em>“(While playing South of Midnight): I’m stuck on Rougarou right now. Can you give me some tips on how to beat this boss?'”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m looking for a new RPG. Can you recommend something that has recently been released on Xbox?”</em></li>
<li><em>“‘Hey Copilot, what’s the rarest achievement you can get in Avowed?’”</em></li>
<li><em>“I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?”</em></li>
<li><em>“When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature will be improved over time, just as you'd expect in this case, with better personalization, proactive tips, and more. Testers can leave feedback under “More Options” in the app's top left corner, or simply by rating the answers with thumbs up or down.</p>
