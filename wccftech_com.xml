			<p>As usual following <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Nintendo quarterly report</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa and 'Fellow' Shigeru Miyamoto (the man behind Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong, and other Nintendo classics) <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered a series of questions fielded in Japanese by investors</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about the company's growing efforts in film and visual media, Shuntaro Furukawa said that movies are 'very well-suited' to Nintendo games. </p>



<p><em>Following the success of "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," I feel that film and visual media are a form of entertainment very well-suited to our games, and we can make unique proposals in this area as Nintendo. As stated in the earlier presentation, this is a field we aim to actively pursue. Through movies and videos, we want to increase our fanbase, spark renewed interest in our games, and build multigenerational support for Nintendo.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, movies are about story and characters, and the Big N has never really managed to shine as much as Sony in these areas. That said, despite his lack of depth, Mario is still arguably the most popular game character, which paid dividends for <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023's record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Its follow-up, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, is slated to air in theaters <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on April 3, 2026</a>, but the most interesting test will be the upcoming Legend of Zelda live action film, starring Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. While still very popular among gamers, the franchise lacks the same level of mainstream recognition as Mario, and how well it can capture an audience remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Miyamoto-san had a much longer response to the same question, pointing out that this is a 'logical next step' for the game developer, and the new internal movie division is focused on experimentation.</p>



<p><em>Nintendo, as an entertainment company, has created a variety of games, IP, and characters. Thinking about entertainment experiences we can maintain long-term, film production became a logical next step. We used to focus on interactivity, but now aim to extend into more passive experiences like film. Film requires people. But we don’t want Nintendo to become a company that just balloons in headcount. Our strategy was to find partners worldwide for joint projects. Content that resonates globally can be made anywhere and speak to anyone—we are investing accordingly. Today, we talk directly and equally with diverse international production teams and creators, and Nintendo’s own developers are involved as well. On the business side, film operates under established structures. If productions are handled well, they generate profit.</em></p>



<p><em>Nintendo Pictures is less about making movies like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," and more about experimenting with new challenges—making short films, running our own research, and tackling less commercially clear areas. Our short film "Close to you" featuring Pikmin is an example. If these pieces become valuable assets for Nintendo’s content library, we will have succeeded.</em></p>



<p>Earlier today, the Japanese game studio and console manufacturer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed its goal to invest in studio acquisitions</a>.</p>

			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-and-events-confirmed.1344916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>
