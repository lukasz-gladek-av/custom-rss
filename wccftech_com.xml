			<p>This morning, some earth-shattering rumors are coming from the Land of the Rising Sun. Reuters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports&nbsp;</a>that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware owner Kadokawa Corporation. Two sources said a deal could be closed in the coming weeks. The mere rumor was enough to send Kadokawa's stock up nearly 23% today.</p>
<p>Like most big Japanese corporations, Kadokawa is really old. It was actually founded only a few months after the end of the Second World War. Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. The most recent version of the corporation was borne out of the October 2014 merger with Dwango.</p>
<p>The group as a whole has several branches for publishing books, manga, films, anime, and much more. Of course, for Sony's PlayStation, the fact that Kadokawa owns nearly 70% of FromSoftware, the studio behind Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring, is clearly a big deal. Moreover, if you've been reading Wccftech, this might not surprise you that much.</p>
<p>Sony already <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> a capital alliance with Kadokawa in February 2021. In August 2022, they even <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> directly in FromSoftware, acquiring around 14% of the shares (Tencent also purchased 16% of the shares at the same time). Shortly following the latter announcement, Hermen Hulst (then head of PlayStation Studios, now CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group) <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-head-teases-new-pc-gaas-investments-possible-transmedia-collaboration-with-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at possible collaborations with FromSoftware not only on games but also on adaptations through the PlayStation Productions division.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this July, and renowned author G.R.R. Martin, who famously contributed to the worldbuilding and lore behind Elden Ring, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> in a not-so-subtle fashion that a feature film or a TV series adaptation might be on the way. Again, it wouldn't be out of character for Sony, which is pushing a lot of its big franchises (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, while the Horizon Netflix TV series was halted due to the showrunner's issues) to be adapted for cinema or television.</p>
<p>Fans of FromSoftware's games are really only interested in knowing how this potential acquisition might affect them, though. Would Sony remove the studio's upcoming games from Xbox and possibly stagger their PC releases? It seems unlikely. Much of the studio's success was built on the multiplatform availability of most of its games, and besides, Sony has already shown with Bungie that they're willing to let a newly purchased studio keep making games for other platforms, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for the GOTY category at The Game Awards 2024 and has a solid chance of winning again.</p>

			<p>Video game publisher tinyBuild has teamed up with indie developer Fire &amp; Frost Studios to reveal their upcoming title Of Ash and Steel, an immersive third-person RPG which is inspired by old-school exploration and storytelling. This title is set to release in 2025 on PC via Steam. Of Ash and Steel draws inspiration from classic fantasy RPGs, offering a nostalgic experience that captures the old-school spirit of adventure, combining it with modern graphics and designs with expansive character progression and dynamic combat.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel takes you to the Kingdom of the Seven, where you work on honing your combat skills and creating alliances with those you find on your journey to survive in a harsh land. You start off as a lowly adventurer, but have a lot of potential to become a great hero that people won't be forgetting any time soon. Compared to a lot of RPGs, Of Ash and Steel doesn't plan to hold your hand, as there are no quest markers that tell you where to go. Instead, the exploration is entirely up to you, and you have to rely on your instincts and curiosity to take you to where you need to go. Of course, along the way, you will find plenty of secrets, treasures, and side quests, which will provide you with a lot of content.</p>

<p>To celebrate the announcement of the upcoming RPG, a five-minute trailer has been released on the tinyBuild YouTube channel, which showcases the graphics, some of the characters you'll meet along the way, and most importantly, the world in which you'll be thrown.</p>
<p>As you explore the Kingdom of the Seven, you'll get to experience an immersive atmosphere with a dynamic weather system, a suited soundtrack, and lots of rewards for those who choose to explore the vast wilderness ahead of them. If you're looking for the medieval RPG experience, the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with when the game is set to release in 2025.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is the first game to be released by Fire &amp; Frost Studios, an indie studio that describes itself as "a small studio by choice... of enthusiasts with burning hearts and cool heads."</p>
<p>When it comes to teaming up with publishers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-acquires-banner-saga-versus-evil-and-qa-testing-firm-red-cerberus/">tinyBuild is one of the most well-known publishers</a> in the indie world, as they are responsible for releasing games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and SpeedRunners, with some of their most recent games being Kingmakers and SAND.</p>
