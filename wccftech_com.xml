			<p>The game in development by the Like a Dragon series developer previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Project Century</a> will be called Stranger Than Heaven, a new trailer confirmed.</p>
<p>The game's new trailer, which was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase and that can be watched below, provided a new look at the game's 1943 setting, which seems to suggest the game will cover two different time periods, as the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz3vtzcacbM">reveal trailer</a> was set in 1915, the main character and some of the gameplay features, which look like an evolution of the those seen in the Like a Dragon series. Sadly, a release window hasn't been provided, so it may be a while until we see more of this very promising project.</p>

<p>The Stranger Than Heaven developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is becoming more and more one of the most prolific game development studios, releasing great games consistently. Only this year, the studio launched Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, a spin-off entry in the series starring fan-favorite character Goro Majima. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's review.</p>
<p>Stranger Than Heaven launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. Platforms have yet to be determined as well.</p>
