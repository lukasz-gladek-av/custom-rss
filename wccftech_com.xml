			<p>A new The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC hotfix was released today, introducing a very welcome new feature and some stability improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.0 hotfix doesn't address many of the issues found in the newly released port of the second entry in the series, but it introduces definite improvements with the addition of an upscale sharpness slider that provides players improved control over sharpening. The game definitely was over-sharpened at launch, so this new feature is extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the upscale sharpness slider, the new The Last of Us Part II Remastered hotfix brings mouse input changes to improve detection of subtle aiming movements and fixes a couple of crashes happening in very specific scenarios. The full patch notes for the hotfix can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2531310/view/526465274493273361?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the PC port released last week by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">report</a>. For more information on what the Remastered version brings over the original PlayStation 4 release, you can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>

			<p>With tomorrow's update, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added to Embark's free-to-play shooter game The Finals, which recently saw the beginning of Season 6 and the arrival of Team Deathmatch as a permanent mode for Quickplay. The game already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-f2p-fps-from-embark-supports-nvidia-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the addition of Multi Frame Generation will boost frame rates even further for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This will be especially useful for those who play with RTXGI enabled.</p>
<p>An update is also adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. Like The Finals, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the new patch unlocks even higher frame rates for RTX 50 owners.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched last week on PC. Despite NVIDIA originally claiming it would include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, it didn't really make it to the final game, as we explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our report</a>. In today's DLSS update, NVIDIA did not refer to that at all, mentioning only Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. They did say the NVIDIA app now supports overriding Super Resolution from the old CNN model to the new transformer model.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new game due to launch on Steam Early Access this Friday will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827230/Wild_Assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Assault</a>, a third-person class-based PvP multiplayer shooter game developed by Combat Cat. In this title, players will select from several anthropomorphic heroes featuring unique abilities based on the original animal that inspired them.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, the Unreal Engine 5 powered game runs 5X faster on average when activating DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, can reach up to 415 frames per second at 4K with all settings maxed out and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
