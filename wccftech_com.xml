			<p>After a few years of silence and over five years since its original reveal, CAPCOM's Pragmata was shown in action today with a brand new trailer, which also confirmed its release window.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdDVyBtYrUI">The new trailer</a>, captured on PlayStation 5 Pro and shown during today's State of Play presentation, provided a new look at the gameplay, which seems to seamlessly combine traversal challenges, puzzles,&nbsp;and intense third-person shooter combat. The trailer also provided a new look at the mysterious powers Diana will be able to use during the adventure to help players overcome the many challenges ahead of them. At the end of the trailer, it's also confirmed that Pragmata will finally launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Pragmata was announced back in 2020, and the long silence made many suspect the game's development had ceased at some point. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/">2023</a>, CAPCOM confirmed that the game was still in the works, but a release date couldn't be confirmed as the developer needed more time to make the best game they could. Now that the release window has been set, it won't take much longer to learn more about the game.</p>
<p>Pragmata launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X , and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>MindsEye isn't out today; it's out in less than a week on June 10, 2025. But, as has always happened since the dawn of any physical media release, some stores have sold physical copies of the game to customers <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930246058543612186">ahead of the release date</a>.</p>
<p>Which means that MindsEye is already out there, and those lucky enough to get their hands on it, like X user <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930233857762103726">MrHazel88</a>, will be able to see what Build a Rocket Boy has been cooking this whole time, and post about what he sees, likely share some gameplay, unencumbered by any embargo agreements or NDA's. They claim they'll only post about <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930246377193251217">how the game runs and avoid spoilers</a>, but they're <a href="https://x.com/gflaxko/status/1930323742363648213">not the only ones who seem to have an early copy</a>.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy is aware that physical copies have been sold early and <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1930332247225225473">has released a statement warning players that copies are already out there.</a> The studio asked players not to post any narrative spoilers, and also pointed out that the game will be without its day-one patch, almost like it was warning them about what they'd be playing sans that patch.</p>
<p>"<em>We want to highlight that a major update for physical copies will be coming at release, bringing key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-positive previews</a> and the news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two of Build a Rocket Boy's chief executives left the studio</a> a week before MindsEye is due to launch, there's an odd air around the game. Copies getting out early, ahead of how Build a Rocket Boy intended them to be experienced, is the latest odd and unfortunate event in the game's journey.</p>
<p>We'll hear and see more about it in just a couple of days with <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-has-announced-its-first-ioi-showcase-for-this-friday-will-feature-007-first-light-mindseye-and-hitman/">Friday's IOI Showcase</a>, and a few days after that, it'll be out, so who knows how it'll register with players once it is properly out the door, day-one patch installed. It could be the next-best game of 2025, for all we know at this point. Or not.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for being part of this journey with us, truly. We can't wait for you to experience MindsEye at launch and explore the main campaign and game creation system we've crafted for you, which delivers an endless stream of engaging new content monthly,</em>" the studio wrote at the end of its statement.</p>
