			<p>Developer Oxide Games and publisher Stardock Entertainment have announced Ashes of the Singularity II, a sequel to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-7900x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-appears-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-benchmark/">2016 original</a> that is set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The news came along with an announcement trailer that showed off a cinematic look at the game, but unfortunately did not show off any gameplay. Ashes of the Singularity II continues the story of the first game, with humanity coming together to fight back against a highly sophisticated AI that has overrun most of the Earth.</p>

<p>"<em>Ten years ago, we set a new, literal benchmark for RTS games with massive battles and groundbreaking technology,</em>" says Stardock Entertainment's chief executive officer, Brad Wardell, in a press release. "<em>With Ashes of the Singularity II, we're raising the bar even higher, delivering strategic gameplay depth that RTS fans have always dreamed of.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Obviously, in the first game the number one request was to have a human faction</em>," Wardell continued. "<em>Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines. We're really excited to bring the humans into the war and watch how they fare against the massive mechanical armies of the Substrate and the PHC.</em>"</p>

			<p>Developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver have announced that upcoming sci-fi action FPS Metal Eden has a new release date, and will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>Metal Eden was initially set to arrive earlier this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">May 6, 2025</a>, with a demo even being made available a little less than a month ahead of that May release date. A little more than a week after the demo went live, however, the game was delayed, with a new release window set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">sometime during summer 2025</a>. </p>



<p>According to Reikon Games, the delay was meant to give the studio time to respond to feedback it had received from players who checked out the demo, as it said at the time that it "<em>saw some clear areas where we can improve</em>."</p>



<p>Now, it seems like Reikon is confident that it has fixed many of the issues players were noting with the demo, and that Metal Eden is ready for prime-time in less than a month from the time of this writing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I checked out the Metal Eden demo as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">June's Steam Next Fest</a>, and at a time where there are hundreds of demos made available for players to try, recommended it as one of the demos to play before the Next Fest has ended due to the fast-paced action that reminded me of Ghostrunner but with more of a ranged-combat focus compared to Ghostrunner's melee combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Guitar Hero and DJ Hero developers, and the creators of the new line of <a href="https://crkd.gg/">CRKD</a> guitars have come together to form <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/">RedOctane Games</a>, a new rhythm game-focused studio that has just entered full production of its debut title, which is set to be revealed later in 2025.</p>



<p>If the RedOctane name sounds familiar to you, that's because RedOctane Inc. was the studio who teamed up with Harmonix to create and publish the first Guitar Hero game back in 2005. It also worked on Guitar Hero II with Harmonix before it was acquired by <a href="https://archive.ph/20120905022821/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-paid-100-mln-redoctane">Activision in 2006</a>, and then under the Activision banner, made Guitar Hero III and Guitar Hero World Tour alongside Neversoft. However, like many other studios under Activision, RedOctane Inc. was caught up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-12-activision-shuts-down-redoctane-underground-development.html">in a round of layoffs in 2010</a>, with the whole studio being shut down and laid off.</p>



<p>Now, RedOctane Inc. is reborn in the form of RedOctane Games, headed up by Simon Ebejer, who worked on the Guitar Hero series since Guitar Hero III as part of Neversoft, and most recently worked on Diablo IV as the vice president of operations on the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Brothers Charles Huang and Kai Huang, who originally founded RedOctane Inc. in 1999, are still part of the RedOctane journey, and confirmed to be members of RedOctane Games' special advisory board.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond Ebejer and the Huang brothers, a press release for the announcement states that the studio is made up of veteran talent who worked on the games that RedOctane was known for nearly two decades ago, and "<em>proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today's rhythm gaming space</em>." And while the team's first title is set to be revealed later this year, the studio is currently working on "<em>a range of innovative rhythm-based experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay, they're about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other,</em>" Ebejer said in the press release. "<em>RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions</em>."</p>



<p>The press release also continues to say that RedOctane Games "<em>is ready to deliver the next evolution in rhythm gaming</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This game wonâ€™t be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband. This is something new," </em>a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1">blog post</a> on the studio's website from Lee Guinchard reads. "<em>A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what RedOctane Games has in the works. Rhythm games are still a significant part of the video game industry, even if they're not taking over living rooms with multiple plastic instruments anymore. Hopefully, we're not waiting too much longer into the rest of 2025 to see what RedOctane Games' debut title is.</p>
