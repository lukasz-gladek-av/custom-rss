			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves debuted a new trailer for the upcoming action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. While the trailer is only two and a half minutes long, it's really just an appetizer for a 45-minute live stream set for June 21 at 12 PM Pacific Time on the DawnwalkerGame Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dawnwalkergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">channel</a>. The event will show around 15 minutes of new gameplay content&nbsp;alongside an extended developer commentary.</p>
<p>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, Game Director and Co-Founder of Rebel Wolves, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s been a pleasure to finally show you more of the game, and I want to thank our community for the incredible support. Back in January, when we first revealed the game, we promised to shed more light on the gameplay this summer—and that moment has finally arrived. We’d like to invite you to join us on June 21 for our Gameplay Reveal Event. You’ll learn more about the abilities Coen gains as he becomes the Dawnwalker – a mysterious being balancing the line between the world of day and the realm of night.</em></p>

<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is the first instalment in Rebel Wolves' original dark fantasy series. Fourteenth-century Europe is engulfed in chaos: bloody wars are tearing the continent apart and the Black Death is claiming a deadly toll. Seizing this moment of weakness, a clique of powerful vampires emerges.</p>
<p>You'll play as Coen, a young man who has become a Dawnwalker: a being that is no longer fully human, yet not quite a vampire. You have just 30 days and nights to save Coen’s family or exact bloody revenge on his sire, regardless of the consequences or the cost to Coen of his thirst for blood. The game will ask the most critical question: is it worth sacrificing your humanity for the ones you love?</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but maybe Rebel Wolves will provide it in a couple of weeks.</p>
