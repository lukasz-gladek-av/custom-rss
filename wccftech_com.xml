			<p>Last Friday saw the release of the newest dungeon in Destiny 2, titled Sundered Doctrine. In this dungeon, Savath√ªn guides the Guardians through a Pyramid ship filled with Dread. Alongside the release of this dungeon, an official Dungeon Race will take place, where fireteams will be competing against each other to complete the activity with Contest Mode enabled. The first verified team that finishes the dungeon will receive a customized trophy. Those who complete Contest Mode within the first 48 hours will receive a special emblem and Exotic Weapon. Once the Contest Mode has been completed by a fireteam, Normal Mode will then unlock.</p>
<p>This content launched alongside Heresy, the new episodic content in Destiny 2 which followed on from<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/"> Revenant</a> and Echoes.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the teams that competed, you can watch it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/evanf1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiktok</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For anyone who completes the dungeon by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Rewards</a> offer that will allow you to purchase the Sundered Doctrine assortment, which includes a work shirt, dungeon bracelet, and pin. Additionally, those who complete the Delver Title by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the Bungie Rewards offer to purchase the Sundered Doctrine Title Pin. Above is a picture of some of the gear that you can purchase should you complete the dungeon in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>Along with the Sundered Doctrine dungeon being launched in Destiny 2, Destiny 2: Heresy launched, which takes Guardians back to Oryx's flagship named the Dreadnaught. Along with this comes new weapons, gear, and subclass Aspects. There will also be new artifact mods to collect and help you become more powerful in-game.</p>
<p>For those who like group content, The Nether debuts as a three-player activity that you can participate in, where players are able to harness the power of the Taken and utilize it to disrupt Anchors and stop the Taken invasion. This event is inspired by the events of Shattered Realm and The Coil.</p>
<p>The Nether event will also feature randomized encounters to keep the content fresh, as well as unique challenges to undertake and opportunities to make your build even stronger by harnessing the strength of powerful boons.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Heresy, a trailer is available now that shows off some of the content you can expect, as well as the story elements&nbsp;that will feature in this new update of Destiny 2.</p>

			<p>One of the newer features added to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iteration</a> of Sid Meier's Civilization is the inclusion of Crisis Events. This also includes Crisis Policies, which are held on the same page as the Social Policies that you can choose for your empire. If you're getting stuck in Civilization 7 and aren't sure what the Crisis Events have in store for you, this guide will explain everything you need to know about Crisis Policies and the Crisis Events themselves in Civilization 7.</p>
<p>For more Civilization 7, check out our other guides.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">How to Disperse an Independent Power</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-raise-settlement-cap-in-civilization-7/">How To Raise Settlement Cap&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are Crisis Policies?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>For every unique Crisis Event in Civilization 7 comes a unique set of Crisis Policies that you will have to choose between. While some of them may seem like they could be beneficial, a lot of the time, the negative effects of the Policies will be very obvious during your playthrough. The Crisis Policies exist to try and help mitigate the dangers of the ongoing crisis rather than help to resolve it entirely. There will be some difficult choices you'll have to make, and as the Crisis evolves, you'll have to choose more Crisis Policies.</p>
<h2>What are Crisis Events in Civilization 7?</h2>
<p>Crisis Events happen through the Antiquity and Exploration Age typically, where you can have anything from a nonstop invasion to the Plague ravaging your empire and nearby cities. Unfortunately, you&nbsp;<strong>cannot stop</strong> these events from happening. They are guaranteed to happen, but it may just take a while for them to happen. Below are the events that could happen in the Antiquity Age and Exploration Age, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Revolts</strong> - The rising unhappiness of your population has reached an all-time high. Your settlements go into open revolt, and they want to tear you down.</p>
<p><strong>Invasion</strong> - Independent Powers will begin to overwhelm your lands and assault your troops and cities. You'll need a strong military for this one.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The plague is self-explanatory but can be incredibly difficult to handle during this age, as there are minimal medical breakthroughs at this point.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Exploration Age there are two different events that can happen in the Exploration Age, but the Plague can also happen here, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wars of Religion</strong> - Nations begin to spread their religions, but this leads to conflict between different religions that believe in their own tenets. You can choose whether or not you think tolerance of other beliefs can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution</strong> - The Bourgeoisie and the middle class begin to rise up and ask for a change in power, which shocks the noble people. You have the option to dampen their revolution efforts or lead a Revolutionary Government.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The Plague can also happen in the Exploration Age. There are more ways to handle it, such as having Medical staff available during this time, but it is significantly more dangerous and more contagious.</p>
<p>While you can't prevent the Crisis Events from happening, if you were to start a new Civilization 7 game, you can <strong>choose to toggle them off</strong>, so you don't have to deal with them in a new playthrough.</p>
