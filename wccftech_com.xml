			<p>The biggest news of the week is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>Ubisoft</strong> undergoing a <strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>" as a company</a>, shaking up its portfolio by cancelling six projects, including the <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying <strong>seven other projects</strong>, and <strong>spinning up four new IPs</strong>; and that's just what we know happened to its portfolio. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><strong>The whole structure of the company</strong> was shifted around to boot</a>, but through all of this mess, one long-running project survived: <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong>.</p>



<p>A game that was said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/">"<em>years away from release</em>"</a> after it had already been in production for <strong>14 years at the time of that report</strong> (which itself is now <strong>four years old</strong>) is still worth burning money on, according to Ubisoft. In fact, the company still believes that the game has something to offer that makes it a "<em>unique proposition</em>" when compared to other modern fantasy games.</p>



<p>"<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on open world adventures</em>," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-long-in-the-works-beyond-good-and-evil-2-a-unique-proposition-in-the-open-world-adventure-market-studio-says">Eurogamer</a>, before continuing to say that fans of fantasy games are "<em>underserved</em>," and that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a "<em>unique proposition</em>" for players.</p>



<p>We've known about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 being in development at Ubisoft since <strong>2008</strong>, when it was first publicly revealed. Since then, the last time <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/">we saw an official trailer for it was at <strong>E3 2017</strong></a>. And while Ubisoft deemed the six to seven years spent on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake were ultimately unsalvageable, the <strong>nearly 18 years it has spent on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> clearly aren't in the minds of Ubisoft leadership. They were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-still-hiring-beyond-good-and-evil-2/">even hiring people for the project <strong>as recently as last November</strong></a>.</p>



<p>(<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">This is the same leadership that led the company to lose <strong>95% of its value in the last eight years.)</strong></a></p>



<p>Ultimately, who knows if this game will ever come out. If it does, and it's a hit, that's great for Ubisoft and for the people who will have likely been waiting a full <strong>20 years</strong> for it to release. But it's more likely that no matter the quality of the final release, no game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 included, can live up to the expectations of a 20-year development period. If anything, you might find more people expecting the worst after it remained gestating for that long.</p>



<p>The fact that people are still working on it, and that there are still players waiting on it, is a testament to the mark left by the first game, which you can thankfully still go and play, and will be able to play for many more years now that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/">remaster of <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong> is available</a>. But with every passing year, the idea of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 releasing as a 'masterpiece of a video game worth the two-decade wait' is a pitch that becomes less and less convincing.</p>



<p>And that's all without mentioning the real kicker in all of this: by the time it comes out (if that day ever arrives), will anyone actually care? Which is to say, it's always a gamble when trying to bring back something old and make today's consumers who didn't grow up with it care about that thing.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development long enough to go to college, and it wouldn't be a surprise if today's generation of young players, who are more interested in playing 'forever games' like <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/"><strong>Roblox, Fortnite,</strong> <strong>Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, couldn't care less about a game from over a decade ago they've only heard of in passing, if they've heard of it at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Nintendo </strong>has officially announced the first <strong>Nintendo Direct</strong> event for 2026, and it's kicking off the year by showcasing what could be its best-selling product: <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">the billion-dollar box-office hit</a> is due to hit theatres this coming <strong>April 3, 2026,</strong> and we're going to get another look at it this coming <strong>Sunday, January 25,</strong> when Nintendo debuts the second <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</strong> at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was first made through the <strong>Nintendo Today!</strong> app, before hitting all of Nintendo's official social media channels. As per usual, the news also came with an obligatory notice telling fans to "<em>Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation</em>." </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This will be our third look at the film, going back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">its initial teaser in <strong>September 2025</strong></a> and its first dedicated direct back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-shows-new-trailer-brie-larson-benny-safdie/">November 2025</a></strong>. In the last direct, we got a look at two characters joining the film franchise: Rosalina, who will be played by <strong>Brie Larson</strong>, and Bowser Jr., who will be played by <strong>Benny Safdie</strong>.</p>



<p>For Sunday's direct, while nothing is necessarily guaranteed, we will almost certainly get a look a <strong>Yoshi</strong> and the actor behind the green dinosaur. In the run-up to the last direct, just two days before it officially premiered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/"><strong>a collaboration with Pilsbury</strong> spoiled our first look at Yoshi's design for the film</a>, and spoiled the confirmation of Bowser Jr. as one of the new characters being introduced.</p>



<p>We've known that Yoshi was going to be involved in this sequel since the first movie came out, thanks to a cliffhanger tease at the end of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, so seeing the character as part of a promotional collaboration wasn't the biggest surprise, but we've yet to see him in motion in the film. Now that we're nearly a full month into 2026, and the film's April premiere date is fast approaching, it feels like this Sunday will be when we get to see the green dinosaur in action in the film for the first time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Craft Comes From Artists, Not Software”: Fortnite Dev Fires Back at Director Who Blames Unreal Engine for Lacking Hollywood CGI]]></title>

			<p>The first three <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> movies were some of the best-looking films of their time, with top-tier visual effects work that remains impressive to this day. For <strong>Gore Verbinski,</strong> the director of all three of those initial films, the visual effects in those three films are still so impressive that it stands above today's Hollywood blockbusters, but according to Verbinski, that's more to do with the tools VFX artists are using now, namely the game engine powering <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> and countless other modern games: <strong>Epic Games'</strong> own <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/">Unreal Engine</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In an interview on <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">ButWhyTho.net</a>, Verbinski laid out his beef with Unreal Engine, claiming that the rise in filmmakers using it for modern VFX is making modern films look worse than they did over 20 years ago. For Verbinski, it's all to do with how Unreal Engine handles light, giving modern films a "<em>gaming aesthetic</em>" that he believes pushes them into an "<em>uncanny valley</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape</em>," Verbinski begins when asked about what, in his mind, qualifies for VFX to be "<em>done right</em>" and how VFX work has changed in the last two decades. "<em>So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think that's why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you've got this different aesthetic. It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint. I just don't think it takes light in the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface scattering, and how light hits the skin and reflects in the same way. So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>That's the first part of Verbinski's answer, and it's overall not the spiciest of takes, but its likely what he said next that got a heated reply from <strong>Pat Tubach</strong>, the VFX supervisor at Epic Games, who it so happens worked in Hollywood VFX for years on several blockbuster movies, from The Mummy, to Jurassic Park 3, to the Avengers, and, as luck would have it, all three of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies, before working at the Fortnite company.</p>



<p>"<em>And then just what's become acceptable from an executive standpoint, where they think no one will care that the ships in the ocean look like they're not on water. In the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat...<strong>I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards."</strong></em></p>



<p>Suggesting that Unreal is a step backwards from Maya in such a strong way is likely what emboldened Tubach to hit back at Verbinski, who gave this statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-hits-back-at-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-who-blamed-unreal-engine-for-bad-cgi-in-modern-movies">IGN</a>:</p>



<p>"<em>It's inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI. It's true that there are a lot more people making computer graphics than ever before, and with that scale comes a range of successes and failures - but <strong>aesthetic and craft comes from artists, not software.</strong>"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases, final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like Pirates of the Caribbean 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done - and I should know - <strong>I was one of them!</strong>"</em></p>



<p>Unreal Engine is not without its faults, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/">but the improvements Epic has put into it over time</a> have genuinely made it look better than ever, and made games look better than ever (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">even if it doesn't always help a game's performance</a>). Verbinski isn't wrong to point out that people don't necessarily want their movies to look like Fortnite, but neither is Tubach when he points to the fact that you can only get so far by blaming the tool an artist uses.</p>
