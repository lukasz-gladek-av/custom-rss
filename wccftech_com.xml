			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that a new Lord of the Rings game is in development, and that a deal regarding the game's funding, which Insider-Gaming alleges will partially come from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), and potentially even the new game, could be revealed next week.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming's report doesn't include details about the new game, save for a claim that this new title is "<em>a third-person action game that is designed, in a way, to 'compete with Hogwarts Legacy.'"</em></p>



<p>Beyond the ADIO's involvement, Embracer Group, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/">purchased the rights to the major fantasy franchise and the right to develop new videogames for it in 2022</a>, are also, as expected, involved. The other studio mentioned in the report is a studio called <a href="https://www.getrevenge.ch/">Revenge</a>.</p>



<p>The last time we got a third-person action game set within the world of The Lord of the Rings was the Middle-Earth series from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. and the now shuttered Monolith Productions</a>. It's the series that fans remember for introducing the infamous Nemesis System, though, thanks to WB having a copyright hold on the mechanic, we can bet it probably won't be included in whatever this new title is.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's exciting to know that there is at least talks of a new action game coming from the world of The Lord of the Rings. The classic PlayStation 2-era titles from EA based on Peter Jackson's films, still hold up in the eyes of many players who were around at the time, and even though we only got two of them, the Middle-Earth games from Monolith Productions are memorable for more than just a single groundbreaking game mechanic.</p>



<p>It would also be nice to see a solid Lord of the Rings game appear on the scene again, since the last two games based on the franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollums-failure-causes-daedalic-to-shut-down-studio-shift-to-publishing-only/">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-the-shire/">Tales of the Shire</a>, didn't exactly hit their mark. </p>

			<p>Over this past weekend, during Tokyo Game Show 2025, Gearbox and 2K unveiled the first of two new vault hunters that'll be joining Borderlands 4 as part of the game's first paid story DLC set to release sometime during Q1 2026.</p>



<p>The new hunter's name is C4SH, a former casino bot turned vault hunter whose skills and abilities will be "<em>distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance</em>," <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/c4sh-vault-hunter-teaser/">according to Gearbox in a blog post</a> on the Borderlands 4 website.</p>

<p>We don't exactly know what that means for now, but Gearbox has said that we'll learn more about who C4SH is and his abilities as we get closer to the release of the first story DLC pack, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. A short teaser trailer released alongside the reveal of C4SH gives us a visual of the character and his kit, but doesn't go into detail on them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you purchased the Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 4 or the Vault Hunter Pack for the game, then you won't have to make an additional purchase when C4SH and the Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned story pack go live. If you just bought the base game, then you'll have to grab this paid DLC separately.</p>



<p>It's all well and good to see what Gearbox is working on bringing to Borderlands 4, particularly for players who've already blown through the game's main story campaign in the last two weeks since it was released and are looking for more to do. But it would be easier to be more excited about it if it weren't for the fact that players are still experiencing major technical issues with the game.</p>



<p>Gearbox is updating the game as quickly as it can, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-update-adds-fov-slider-consoles-stability-improvements-more/">adding technical fixes and (in some cases) adding features that really should have been in the game at launch</a>, but it'll likely be a while before all of its major issues have been mopped up.</p>



<p>It can also only be seen as humorous that the teaser trailer for C4SH includes a mention of the Nintendo Switch 2 version, which, on top of Borderlands 4's other issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">was indefinitely delayed last week</a> after initially scheduled to release on October 3.</p>



<p>A new Vault Hunter on the scene is nice. A game without major frame rate issues that didn't crash all the time would be better.</p>
