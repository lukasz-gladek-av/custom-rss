			<p>Fans of the dragon-themed platform series owned by <strong>Activision</strong> are getting an early Holiday present this year with the leaked news that a <strong>Spyro 4</strong> game is in development. The information was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQsIoR2rXk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Canadian Guy Eh', who noticed that a former <strong>Toys for Bob</strong> developer included on his LinkedIn resume that he worked on 'Spyro' for nearly two years up until March 2024.</p>



<p>Given the timeline, this cannot possibly be related to the <strong>Reignited Trilogy</strong>, which was first released on November 13, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-confirmed-for-pc-switch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted on PC and Nintendo Switch</a> on September 3, 2019. Chances are, then, this is the next project in development at Toys for Bob.</p>



<p>Some readers may recall that the studio, based in Novato, California, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-developer-suffers-layoffs-will-work-on-call-of-duty-warzone-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assigned to assist with Call of Duty Warzone</a> for a period of time in 2021. Toys for Bob later launched <strong>Crash Team Rumble</strong>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-rumble-is-all-about-taking-platforming-into-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4v4 team-based multiplayer game</a>, in June 2023. The game wasn't received well, though, and by March 2024, the studio had decided to separate from Activision (and therefore from its new owner, Microsoft), <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-goes-indie-but-will-still-likely-partner-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regaining its independence</a>. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bobs-first-independent-game-will-still-be-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, their first independent project is still expected to be made in partnership with Microsoft and, therefore, based on one of its IPs, of which Spyro is certainly one they're familiar with.</p>



<p>A Spyro 4 rumor actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-4-teased-in-crash-4-its-about-time-art-book-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first circulated five years ago</a>, when it was discovered that the official art book of the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></strong> (also developed by Toys for Bob) included new concept art related to the cute purple dragon.</p>



<p>While we wait for an official announcement, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/spyro-reignited-trilogy-classics-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Reignited Trilogy</a> is currently available at a 65% discount on PC (Steam) and Xbox, whereas PlayStation users can only buy it at full price ($39.99) right now via the PlayStation Store. Spyro Reignited Trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can also be found on the Game Pass subscription</a> service at the Premium and Ultimate tiers.</p>
