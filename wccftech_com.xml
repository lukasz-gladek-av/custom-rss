			<p>Today, PocketPair has unveiled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>, a Palworld spin-off dedicated to farming. In the game, each Pal uses its special abilities to help support your farm: those skilled at sowing will plant seeds, those skilled at watering will water the crops daily, and those skilled at harvesting will help with the harvest or assist with crafting.</p>



<p>Palworld: Palfarm is set on an island, home to many unique Pals and residents. Players can gradually deepen their relationships with the Pals and the island's people through daily conversations, working together, and occasionally giving gifts. The Pals might even play matchmaker for you with someone you're interested in. Your bond with a Pal or resident can even grow into a special relationship.</p>



<p>The game will also include some combat. There aren't just nice Pals to help you with the farm; some nasty ones raid farms or lurk underground waiting to pounce on unsuspecting farmers. Defeating them will provide resources to develop the farm further. There is even a marketplace on the island, run by residents and Pals, where players can buy and sell crops and crafted goods. Players may find rare items there. According to rumors, a forbidden black market is also hidden on the island's far side. There, players can trade all sorts of things, including guns and suspicious fertilizer. Finally, Palworld: Palfarm also supports online co-op multiplayer, allowing multiple people to work on the same farm.</p>



<p>The game doesn't have a release window yet. However, the Steam page already lists the very basic minimum requirements for the PC version:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 or later (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong> i5-3570K 3.4 GHz 4 Core</li>



<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>GPU:</strong> GeForce GTX 1050 (2GB)</li>



<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11</li>



<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 40 GB available space</li>



<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Palworld: Palfarm wasn't today's only announcement from PocketPair. The Japanese studio also <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1970293300939628571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a collaboration with ULTRAKILL, the retro FPS from Arsi Patala. Gear and weapons from the cult-hit ULTRAKILL will land on Palworld soon.</p>



<p>As a reminder, the developer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that its massively successful debut game will launch out of early access next year.</p>

			<p>During his studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10th anniversary event</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, Hideo Kojima shared updates on upcoming projects, starting with OD, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survived Microsoft's most recent cancellations</a>. </p>



<p>The horror game published by Xbox Game Studios received a brand new trailer featuring Sophia Lillis, who we've long known will play one of the characters alongside Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer. It does feel quite spooky, that's for sure, though it tells us close to nothing about how it'll actually play. A couple of months ago, Kojima just <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mused</a> that OD will probably be the type of game that some players love with a passion and others hate right away. We'll have to wait some more time to understand exactly what he means.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The tenth anniversary livestream then went on to reveal the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> new animation film project, Death Stranding Mosquito. It will be produced by ABC ANIMATION, featuring a screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband, Prisoners, The Red Road, Papillon, and Raised by Wolves). Death Stranding Mosquito will be directed by Hiroshi Miyamoto. Obviously, this is a separate project from the live action Death Stranding film, which will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written and directed by Michael Sarnoski</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Kojima shared a few details about PHYSINT, the new tactical espionage action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made in partnership with Sony</a>. First of all, a key art was shared, presumably teasing a protagonist who looks a lot like Eddie Redmayne (despite previous rumors that the game would feature Robert Pattinson). That remains unconfirmed, but we did get confirmation of three actors: Charlee Fraser (Anyone But You, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Ma Dong-seok (also known as Don Lee, previously featured in Train to Busan, Eternals, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla Minus One). </p>

<p>Kojima revealed that the recent SAG-AFTRA strike affected the project's development, delaying the casting process. That said, news on the main character's identity will come soon. Additionally, it was confirmed that 3Lateral, the team behind the MetaHuman technology (<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-3lateral-agog-labs-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Epic Games in 2019</a>), is developing new technology to capture Minami Hamabe's likeness accurately. As a reminder, PHYSINT is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the conceptual phase</a> and may therefore be five to six years away.</p>
