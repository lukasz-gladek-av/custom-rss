<p>There are less than two months between the publication of this article and the release of Dying Light: The Beast. This game started as the second DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. However, it slowly evolved into a standalone game that Polish developer Techland is now referring to as essentially Dying Light 3 in all but name.</p>



<p>Why did the studio change its mind about this project being a DLC for DL2? Well, Franchise Director Tymon Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in an interview with Wccftech</a> that Techland suffered a narrative leak in 2023, with hackers getting their hands on the DLC's plot. That and a desire to bring back the original game's protagonist spurred the team toward an entirely new direction. Interestingly, in another, more recent interview with Wccftech, Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> the desire to make games more quickly, starting with this one, which only took about three and a half years compared to the seven years or so that were necessary for the first two games.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on Friday, August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be released later in 2025 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, too, as Techland hasn't abandoned the old console generation yet. In the aforementioned interview, Tymon Smektala also <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to see the game on Nintendo Switch 2, too, but there's no confirmation yet.</p>



<p>The game is already available for pre-order in two different editions. The Standard Edition is priced at $59.99, while the Deluxe Edition costs $10 more and includes the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official Soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper Pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods Tourist Map</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Bundle</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>



<li>Roadhog</li>
</ul>



<p>Any pre-order will also receive the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li>



<li>Harran Combat Knife (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>The Follower Crossbow (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory Pistol (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, anyone who purchased Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition at launch will receive Dying Light: The Beast for free, owing to the fact that the game was originally planned as the second story-driven DLC for Stay Human.</p>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Just like its predecessors, Dying Light: The Beast is an open world action survival horror game played exclusively in first-person view. The setting is Castor Woods, a rural region that was once popular among tourists before the zombie apocalypse. Techland has confirmed to Wccftech that Castor Woods is definitely geographically closer to Villador (the setting of Dying Light 2) than Harran (that of the first installment), with both taking inspiration from European countries. However, the returning protagonist is Kyle Crane, once again voiced by Roger Craig Smith. </p>



<p>After the events of the first game and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Following</a>, Crane was taken prisoner and has been for thirteen years the unwilling subject of experimentation with the zombie virus at the behest of Marius 'The Baron' Fischer. After finally escaping captivity, Crane's main goal is to get revenge on The Baron. To that end, Techland said they took inspiration from the South Korean movie Oldboy, where the main character similarly escapes from long captivity and then sets out on his vengeance mission. Chronologically, the events of Dying Light: The Beast take place right after Dying Light 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>In many ways, the developers are seeking a return to the first game's more hardcore survival feel, which most fans prefer to Dying Light 2. One example is save zones, which take after the basic design of the original title with some additional features such as barricading. </p>



<p>In combat, players will be able to take advantage of Crane's new beast-like powers. The franchise always put a strong emphasis on melee combat, and with his enhanced strength, the protagonist can crush skulls, rip heads off, and tear enemies in half. However, firearms are in the game from the start, unlike with Dying Light 2, where they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-roadmap-shows-the-game-is-getting-firearms-weapon-repairs-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added with a patch</a> after launch. Similarly, parkour will still be a big part of the game, although the more rural setting of Castor Woods will make jumping from building to building less common. On the other hand, vehicles (specifically, a 4x4) return from Dying Light: The Following, allowing players to feel the joy of crushing zombie hordes under their wheels.</p>



<p>In keeping with series tradition, players will find it easier to explore Castor Woods during the day, while the most dangerous breeds of infected come out at night, where everything is much harder. Co-operative gameplay for up to four players is also available in this new installment, and shared progression has been confirmed so that player groups can experience the whole adventure together.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is powered by the latest iteration of Techland's proprietary C-Engine. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, improvements have been made in rendering weather effects, materials, lighting, shadows, and more. PC system requirements haven't been shared yet, so we will update this article once they are made public. However, the fact that the game will eventually be available on old-gen consoles makes it likely that the specs won't be too demanding.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">laid off</a> around 9K employees in the latest round of cuts, affecting 4% of the company's total workforce. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Seattle Times</a>, this is all part of the company's mandate to trim and make room for increased spending in AI infrastructure. </p>



<p>The report says it's not quite like one game developer from Halo Studios reckoned last week when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Microsoft was doing its damnedest to replace personnel with AI agents. However, Microsoft is indeed cutting costs as much as possible to accommodate its planned expenditures of over $80 billion in this area, a $25 billion increase over the previous year. These investments are seen as more necessary than ever by Microsoft, with Open AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-as-openai-starts-eating-palantirs-lunch-and-grows-increasingly-territorial-with-microsoft/">showing its fangs lately in what has become a complicated partnership</a>.</p>



<p>However, the cuts are weighing heavily on the company's reputation in other areas, such as gaming. Microsoft spent dozens of billions on gaming acquisitions, such as Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, to expand its Game Pass subscription service library. Still, the user base didn't grow nearly as much as hoped, and analysts are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that Xbox might have bet on the wrong horse, since subscriptions do not hold the same appeal for gamers as they do for music or TV/film fans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the industry's reaction to these latest layoffs was more scathing than ever before. Fourteen months after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, which had released a successful and critically acclaimed game (Hi-Fi Rush), Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled</a> a promising online looter shooter from ZeniMax Online Studios, the makers of The Elder Scrolls Online, one of the gaming division's top performers. Former developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">railed against </a>the decision, saying that the project was finally heading in a great direction, and there have been rumors that even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a blast while playing a vertical slice of Project Blackbird</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The only logical conclusion is that the executive did not wish to cancel the game himself, but may have received a mandate from above. Finishing Project Blackbird would have cost quite a bit, as it was just about to ramp up to production with an estimated late 2028 launch window, and Microsoft had other priorities - chiefly, bolstering its AI infrastructure. For gamers and developers alike, though, it's a shame.</p>
