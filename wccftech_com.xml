			<p>The <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">VR</a> <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">Games Showcase</a> is an event usually reserved for announcing new games or updates on current VR games. It's one of the few digital showcases in a year that VR enthusiasts should pay attention to in order to find out what's on the docket for VR games on PCVR, Meta Quest, and a few PlayStation VR2 games as well. Today's show however, included its very first mod, as a VR mod for popular shooter Ready or Not was revealed.</p>



<p>Ready or Not is a new tactical first-person shooter from VOID Interactive that initially launched on PC in December 2023. In less than two years following that launch, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">sold 9 million copies on PC</a>, a milestone reached a little less than three months before it arrived on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, where it went on to sell another <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-hits-2-million-copies-sold-console/">2 million copies</a> just two weeks after its July 15, 2025, arrival on consoles.</p>



<p>It's unusual, to say the least, for a mod announcement to be part of a showcase like the VR Games Showcase, which also noted that this VR mod was the first time the presentation had featured a mod, but given the current popularity of Ready or Not, the mod's inclusion does make sense.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mod is being made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualRealityOasis">Virtual Reality Oasis YouTuber Mike Cussell</a>, who is also a co-founder of a VR influencer marketing and game testing company, <a href="https://www.xrgamelabs.com/">XR Game Labs</a>. Cussell isn't alone in the project however, as he's developing it with modder KITT to bring the tactical gameplay of Ready or Not to life in VR.</p>



<p>When the mod is ready, it'll be available to everyone who owns the base game for free, and according to Cussell, it'll be ready "<em>soon</em>," though no actual release date or release window was confirmed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also currently no indication that Cussell and KITT could work with VOID Interactive to help bring the game to VR for PlayStation players, though if the mod proves popular with PC players, it could potentially be something VOID Interactive looks into for the future. Until then, PlayStation VR2 owners are better off buying that adaptor to plug their headset into their PC and hope for the best when the mod arrives.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-mod-%E2%80%98versus-mode%E2%80%99-is-the-closest-thing-there-is-to-a-game-master-mode.1268265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a better game than Larian's previous title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, in almost every regard, with one notable exception: the former game's lack of a Game Master mode. Divinity: Original Sin 2, on the other hand, allowed Game Masters (or Dungeon Masters, as they are usually called in tabletop RPGs) to recreate the atmosphere of a pen-and-paper game, crafting brand new adventures and quests where other players, the so-called 'party of heroes', were ultimately at their whims.</p>



<p>It was the closest thing gamers could find to a videogame version of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons session. It would stand to reason that Baldur's Gate 3, a game made on the D&amp;D license, would get that as well, but it did not. Larian Studios CEO and Game Director Swen Vincke explained a few years ago that it would have taken way too much time and effort, and given that Baldur's Gate 3 ended up being a gargantuan game (even larger than Divinity: Original Sin 2), the mode simply never materialized.</p>



<p>However, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get proper modding tools about a year ago</a>, and now modder 786r786 has uploaded a 'Versus Mode' mod on both <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17984?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/versus-mode4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod.io</a>. While not nearly as extensive as the Game Master mode in Larian's previous game, it does allow the host of an online session to gain control of monsters:</p>



<p><em>When an enemy's turn starts, the game gives control to the host player allowing players to fight against each other by controlling enemies. Make sure to click the blue enemy portraits at the start of their turn to actually control them.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This mod is intended to be used in multiplayer with two or more players.</strong> To use this mod correctly, have the host player spectate the other players until they enter combat at which point the host will be able to control the enemies on their turn.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this Versus Mode can be expanded in the future to allow something even closer to the aforementioned Game Master mode featured in Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

			<p>Following several <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-productions-launches-closed-beta-for-single-player-survival-roguelike-prologue-go-wayback/">closed betas</a>, PUBG Productions' new hardcore survival game, Prologue: Go Wayback! is available for players to check out now in open beta form, with its early access launch still set for sometime later in 2025, according to the studio.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! - Open Beta Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hU9eG0-Ep8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>"<em>After running playtests with our Discord community over the last 6 months, and receiving some fantastic feedback, we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions,"</em> writes Brendan Greene, also known as PlayerUnknown, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>We have a great survival experience, with millions of maps for players to explore in the Open Beta, and over the coming months leading up to our Early Access launch, we plan to add more features to further customize your preferred way to play</em>."</p>



<p>So while this is not the full release of Prologue: Go Wayback!, it will be the biggest look at the game for players so far, who will now have more than enough time to spend wandering the wilderness in this survival title.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more about Prologue: Go Wayback!,<a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/"> check out our interview with PlayerUnknown </a>earlier this year, and hear how Greene describes this title as the first step in a three-game project.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ninja Gaiden 4 to Last 15-20 Hours, Plus Challenge Missions and Optional ‘Purgatory’ Battles]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours-plus-challenge-missions-and-optional-%E2%80%98purgatory%E2%80%99-battles.1268187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-1-hour-new-gameplay-team-ninja-explains-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of fresh new gameplay footage</a>, Team Ninja has now also shared an estimate of how long Ninja Gaiden 4 is going to be when it releases later this year. <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Australian website Next Play</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama said that the first playthrough should take most players between fifteen and twenty hours, but then there are also the Challenge Missions to consider.</p>



<p><em>Your first playthrough, you can expect about 15 to 20 hours. But, like I mentioned before, after you beat the game once, you unlock Master Ninja difficulty and then, of course, outside of the story mode, there’s also the challenge missions and also chapter challenge as well … so there’s going to be a robust amount of content for players to sink their teeth into after they complete their first playthrough.</em></p>



<p>Regarding these Challenge Missions, Hirayama-san added:</p>



<p><em>In the full release, there’ll be missions outside of just boss fights. So you have to fight in groups of enemies under special conditions that differ from what you experienced in the story mode.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 also offers some optional battles hidden within the game 'Purgatory', and you can even wager before entering these fights. Hirayama explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s kind of an evolution of the Tests of Valor that were in previous Ninja Gaiden games. The idea of having players choose the level of risk for that reward, that was something we included to kind of stoke the flames of challenge.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, with Xbox Game Studios publishing the title. It will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Just like all the games published by Xbox Game Studios, it will also be available for PC and Xbox Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[European Gamers Spend More on Microtransactions than North Americans, says Newzoo, but they’re also More Likely to Buy Something on Sale]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/newzoo-tebex-european-gamers-spend-more-on-microtransactions-north-american/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/european-gamers-spend-more-on-microtransactions-than-north-americans-says-newzoo-but-they%E2%80%99re-also-more-likely-to-buy-something-on-sale.1268127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm for videogame industry sales has collaborated with <a href="https://www.tebex.io/">Tebex</a>, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game purchases to publish a report that dives into player spending in North America and Europe. </p>



<p>The <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em> report has more than a few interesting revelations about player spending in North America and Europe, like how players in those two regions are the minority of the world's gamers but <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">drive nearly half of all spending in the videogame industry</a>.</p>



<p>But the videogame industry is not what it was 20 years ago, where spending trends would be mostly based on players buying individual games. Microtransactions are the name of today's game in the modern videogame landscape, and there are some interesting differences between North American players spending on microtransactions versus European players.</p>



<p>At a top-level look, players in Europe spend on microtransactions than players in North America, with sports games being the top genre in Europe, while shooters are the top genre in North America. "<em>Microtransactions make up nearly half of PC and one-third of console gam revenues in Europe</em>," according to Newzoo and Tebex.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>In both North America and in Europe, however, consoles are the only platforms where premium game purchases still account for over 50% of player spending. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But when it comes to why players are spending their hard-earned cash, the reason for hitting the 'buy now' button is very different for players in North America and players in Europe. 28% of European players, according to Newzoo and Tebex, will choose to spend their money in the videogame industry if something is on sale or at what they deem to be a 'good price.' Whereas North American players top reason for buying anything is so that it gives them access to extra or exclusive playable content.</p>



<p>Buying something because it's on sale is the fifth of the top-five reasons listed for North America.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as what microtransactions players are buying in North America and Europe, however, those lists are much closer. Four out of the top five categories of in-game microtransaction purchases are the same between North American and European players, with players in both regions prioritizing expansions, power-ups, in-game currencies, and in-game subscriptions.</p>



<p>Loot boxes or gacha, as they're listed by Newzoo and Tebex, are at the bottom of the list for both North America and Europe, but that feels at least slightly misleading, since it seemingly means loot boxes purchased directly with real money, rather than a player buying an in-game currency to then spend on loot boxes.</p>



<p>For all the new statistics and bits of information shared in Newzoo and Tebex's report, one element that isn't news to anyone is, to the chagrin of some players, microtransactions and virtual currencies are not going anywhere, anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>Virtual currencies and microtransactions are no longer just revenue streams</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>They're becoming strategic levers for retention and differentiation</em>."</p>
