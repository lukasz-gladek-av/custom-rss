			<p>Guerilla Games and NCSoft finally announced the Horizon-based MMORPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">we've been hearing about for years</a> today with the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">Horizon Steel Frontiers,</a> which is coming to PC and mobile sometime within the next couple of years. But that's not the only multiplayer Horizon game that Guerilla has on the go.</p>



<p>While previous rumors about an upcoming Horizon multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">seem to have been focused on the coming MMORPG</a>, Guerilla's next major release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, is a separate multiplayer game that the company is working on.</p>



<p>"<em>Just to clear up some confusion I've seen</em>," Schreier writes in a post on Bluesky, "<em>the newly announced NCSoft Horizon MMO is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that's in development at Guerilla Games. That one is Guerilla's next big project</em>."</p>







<p>Unlike Steel Frontiers, which is coming to PC and mobile, and not PS5, this new multiplayer title from Guerilla will likely not be skipping Sony's console, though it will still likely be a multi-platform release to at least PC players.</p>



<p>Now that Steel Frontiers has had its official reveal, hopefully this other project that the studio is working on isn't too far behind. Guerilla's studio director Jan-Bart van Beek made it clear a couple of short years ago that the team is continuing with the Horizon franchise for a long while, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-developer-has-16-plans-for-the-franchise-highlights-challenges-in-creating-the-multiplayer-game/">that they have scores of ideas on where to take it, new multiplayer games being just one of those avenues</a>. </p>

			<p><strong>Update 13/11/2025:</strong> A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">Insider-Gaming</a> includes an internal email from the chief financial officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, who claims that the stoppage of trading was done "<em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>."</p>



<p>Here's the full email, per Insider-Gaming: </p>



<p>"<em>Hello everyone</em>,</p>



<p><em>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</em></p>



<p><em>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</em></p>



<div><p><em>Thanks for your understanding.</em></p><p><em>Fred</em>"</p></div>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Suddenly, and just 15 minutes before the financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year were meant to go live, Ubisoft not only <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/FR0000054470-XPAR#CompanyPressRelease-12847243">delayed the release of its results but also halted the trading of its shares and bonds</a> ahead of the market opening tomorrow on November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>There's been no comment from Ubisoft explaining the delay or why it stopped trading its shares and bonds, but such a sudden stoppage and delay don't exactly indicate that everything is smooth sailing at the company. What it does indicate is that there's likely something major going on within the company right now, potentially something as major as an acquisition.</p>



<p><em>Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days</em>," the company said in a statement. "<em>Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</em>"</p>

<p>It's no secret that Ubisoft has had a turbulent few years. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">several instances</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">layoffs at the company</a>, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">had a few </a>of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/">big titles in recent years</a> result in <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">big commercial misses</a>, with its one saving grace <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">being the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p>



<p>The new subsidiary that it opened alongside Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">officially called Vantage Studios,</a> is seemingly a result of its commercial woes, since it included a major investment from Tencent, and, specifically for the company's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, allowed the Guillemot family to retain control of the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">and held off calls for the company to go private</a>.</p>



<p>But those calls might not have been held off for long, since this sudden delay could very well be due to Ubisoft getting set to announce that it has been acquired, either by Tencent or by another large entity. We know that there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">discussions about a Ubisoft buyout</a> following the struggles it has had recently, and now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA has begun that process with the Saudi Arabia PIF and the Consortium</a> of private equity investors, it could have been that Ubisoft shareholders used EA's purchase as fuel to campaign for Ubisoft to be acquired.</p>



<p>For now, this is all just speculation, but the sudden nature of the results release being delayed and the stoppage of trading, on top of everything else that has been going on with Ubisoft in the last few years, point to a major shift in the company due to be announced within the coming days. Or it could be nothing, we'll see.</p>
