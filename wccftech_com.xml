			<p>Xbox announced that Embark Studios' team-based multiplayer shooter THE FINALS is now available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/26/game-pass-free-to-play-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass Ultimate</a> and PC Game Pass. Just eight days ago, season 6 of THE FINALS began, where there are now even more ways to compete with each other, as well as an updated arsenal to provide more variety in gameplay.</p>
<p>Team Deathmatch has now become a permanent Quickplay mode for Season 6. There are now six arenas that you can play in. By jumping into Quick Play, you can fight off against other players to try and get yourself on the leaderboard and earn progression rewards. Similar to the World Tour, you will now earn points regardless of how the match turns out, allowing you to progress through the season a little bit faster to get rewards. Of course, winning a match does reward you with more points.</p>
<p>With the RISING STARS Battle Pass, there are 106 rewards to collect that are inspired by the Golden Age of sports entertainment. This includes outfits, emotes, and more. For those with the Premium Battle Pass, you'll be able to earn 1575 Multibucks, which will allow you to afford the next season's pass and some extra cosmetics if you like.</p>
<p>There is also a free track available, where you can unlock 26 rewards, including Multibucks and outfits, to show off your flair in the game.</p>
<p>For those who are planning on playing THE FINALS through Game Pass, there will be specific benefits that you will receive for playing through Game Pass. This includes the Stryker Grid Set, sponsored by Ivada, which will give you a full outfit, three weapon skins, a charm, and a 25% boost to Match XP. When you claim your prize, you will also be given 500 Multibucks.</p>
<p>As there is a new season taking place, there are now three new weapons to experiment with, including a brand-new Minigun.</p>
<p>This season also sees three Sponsors, named OSPUZE, ALFA ACTA and ENIGMO, respectively. They all have their own benefits, which is explained on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for THE FINALS, where you can make your decision as to who you want to compete for.</p>
<p>As with every season, there are major <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/">quality-of-life changes</a> that have been implemented, including a bunch of improvements and revamps to make THE FINALS a smoother experience overall. This includes an overhaul to The Store and a new coat of paint for the Las Vegas Stadium.</p>
<p>There is much more included in this season of THE FINALS, which can all be found on the game's official website, where the patch notes break down everything you need to know.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft is forming with Tencent a new subsidiary based on its three most popular franchises,<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/"> as rumored in the past few months.</a></p>
<p>The new subsidiary, in which Tencent is investing 1.16 billion euros for a 25% minority stake, is based on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six brands and will include the development teams of all three series based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia as well as the back-catalog and any new games currently under development or to be developed. In regard to its relationship with Ubisoft, the new subsidiary will be granted by the publisher a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable license in respect of the intellectual property and similar proprietary rights owned or licensable by Ubisoft in relation to the three brands in exchange for a royalty.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the creation of the new subsidiary, saying: <em>“With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</em></p>
<p>Martin Lau, President of Tencent, also commented on the new subsidiary formed with Ubisoft, saying: <em>"We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with </em><em>Ubisoft through this investment, which reflects our continued confidence in Ubisoft’s creative vision and exceptional talent to drive sustained success in the industry. We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</em></p>
