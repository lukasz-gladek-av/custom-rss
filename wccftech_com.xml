			<p>Following <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">its release earlier this year</a></strong>, the Nintendo Switch 2 has received multiple system updates that introduced new features to the system, improved backward compatibility with select original Switch titles, enhanced the system's stability for a better user experience and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-fixes-frustrating-bluetooth-issue-and-more/"><strong>fixed some critical issues</strong></a>. Today, the Japanese company started the December system update cycle with a new update that also launched for the original Switch.</p>



<p>The 21.1.0 system update for both systems is a minor system update that introduces <em>"<strong><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473#current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience,"</a></strong> </em>so all those expecting a major new feature, such as Home Menu themes, will be disappointed. The new update will be automatically downloaded and installed by both systems when connected online.</p>



<p>While the new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is still being examined by datamining experts such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OatmealDome</strong></a> to reveal all undocumented changes, Nintendo itself has confirmed that the new update fixes an issue that caused video playback in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to malfunction, a change not listed in the official update notes. We will update this post if any further undocumented change is discovered in the coming days.</p>

			<p>Even before <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem was formally announced earlier this year</strong></a>, it was widely rumored that Leon Kennedy, the protagonist of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, would have been one of the protagonists of the ninth entry in the series. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">With the development team never confirming whether the character was in or not</a></strong> following the game's official announcement, however, it seemed like the rumors were wrong, but today it has been finally confirmed that the character will indeed be in the game in some capacity.</p>



<p>Leon in Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed today via a PlayStation Store leak, which shows a new cover art for the game featuring both Grace and the beloved classic series character. The new cover art has been confirmed to be on the PlayStation Store by multiple users, so it's most likely real.</p>

<p>As the PlayStation Store has a nasty habit at leaking information about games a few days before the official announcements, there's little doubt at this point that the first footage of Leon in Resident Evil Requiem will be shown during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>, which will take place on December 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-will-combat-work-in-resident-evil-requiem">How will Combat Work in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/"><strong>first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage</strong></a> surfaced online, showing Grace fighting enemies with a battle system that is reminiscent of that of the fourth entry in the series. As the character is likely not going to be a combat expert like a battle-hardened veteran like Leon, there's a very good chance the two characters will have access to different combat skills that should make the experience deeper, more engaging, and, most of all, more varied.</p>



<p>Although the confirmation that Leon Kennedy will be in Resident Evil Requiem is very welcome news for fans of the series (and one that will make them look even closer at the reveal trailer, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">said to have the first hints of the character being in the game</strong></a>), I expected the new entry in the series to be an excellent survival horror game, nonetheless. I had the chance to try it out earlier this year during Gamescom ahead of its launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2, and<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> I was thoroughly impressed by its great atmosphere and the ability to switch between first and third-person camera</strong>.</a></p>
