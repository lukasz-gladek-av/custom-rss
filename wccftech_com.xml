			<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 is now available, introducing many improvements that will aid developers in creating high-fidelity open worlds running at 60 frames per second on current generation hardware.</p>
<p>The new features of the latest version of the engine have been revealed during this year's edition of State of Unreal, and summarized in a video which showcases hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, revamped Tween Tools and redesigned Curve editor, procedural physics via the new Physics Control rig, MetaHuman creation tools now being embedded in the engine with brand-new features, simplified user interface and more, and smoother and more efficient GPU spawning at runtime.</p>

<p>A first in-game look at some of the Unreal Engine 5.6 features summarized in the video above was provided earlier today with the first-ever <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV gameplay</a>. While the footage may be a little lacking in terms of action, it does an excellent job showcasing some of the new technology CD Projekt Red is developing together with Epic that will make the game one of the most immersive open-world RPGs ever, such as Nanite Foliage, which allows the developer to create dense foliage without having a major impact on performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tales-of-kenzera-developer-announces-new-horror-game-dead-take-coming-to-pc-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Surgent Studios, the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/">Tales of Kenzera: ZAU</a>, has announced its next project, a horror game called Dead Take.</p>
<p>Instead of working with EA again with Dead Take being another EA Originals project, Dead Take will be published by Pocketpair Publishing, and is due to arrive on just PC for now, sometime in 2025. It's unclear if there are plans to bring the game to consoles sometime later on.</p>
<p>The story of Dead Take sees you put into the shoes of an actor who begins to get "<em>uneasy</em>" per the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam page</a> when they can't get their friend on the phone. Dead Take seems to be all about the entertainment industry, going behind the "<em>glittering facade to expose its darkest secrets,</em>" according to a press release.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEAD TAKE | Teaser | Surgent Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1dJASFBl3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, the teaser trailer and everything we've seen about Dead Take so far doesn't give us a lot to go on, but that's by design, according to chief executive officer and studio founder Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"<em>We're being secretive for a reason</em>," Salim said in a press release. "<em>The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'.</em>"</p>
<p>As a debut project for a new indie team, Tales of Kenzera: ZAU showed that Surgent Studios is a talented team that's capable of telling emotionally resonant stories in games. It's exciting to see them take on a horror project, and hopefully, Salim is right when he says it won't be too long before we get the chance to play it ourselves.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-showcased-state-of-unreal/">The Witcher IV trailer</a> was shared today, alongside impressive gameplay footage running on base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which was shown at the beginning of this year's State of Unreal presentation and can be watched below, is the first in-engine look at the next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red and sets the stage for the first impressive gameplay showcase which the development studio used to show some of the new technology that will power the game setting out to be the most ambitious entry in the series, and one that will bring open-world RPGs to the next generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - Cinematic Trailer | State of Unreal 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_aRhNcHryA?start=115&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The gameplay showcase features Ciri as she travels to a village in Kovir together with her horse Kelpie, allowing the developers to show multi-character motion matching for Ciri and Kelpie, machine learning deformation to realistic render the horse's muscle with limited impact on performance, as well as Nanite Foliage, which solved the issue of needing dense foliage without impacting performance and allowed the developers to surpass the LOD tricks that have been used so far. Once Ciri reaches the village, it becomes clear how immersive The Witcher IV's world will be, as everything will be massively responsive, and there will sometimes be chain reactions between different elements. At the end of the showcase, we also got the first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir. The gameplay showcase can be checked out below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersPrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamersPrey</a>.</p>

<p>The Witcher IV will not launch until 2027 at the earliest. A precise release window has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[40 Minute+ PlayStation State Of Play Announced For Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow.1205529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has announced a new State of Play event for tomorrow, June 4, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT / 11pm CEST, that will be more than 40 minutes long and feature "<em>news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe</em>."</p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">PlayStation Blog</a>, as these kinds of events always are now, with nothing more than the short description quoted above to give a very opaque, general idea as to what players will see at the show.</p>
<p>It's the first big game-announcements-focused show of the week ahead of the big Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off show, which technically makes it the real kick-off event of this announcements-driven week that we're about to have.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as what we'll see, the news of this showcase makes the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9 reveal rumors</a> feel all the more possible, as we've previously seen major Resident Evil games, like Resident Evil Village, get their reveal during a PlayStation event.&nbsp;Another game to look out for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, which is still without a release date, but is due to get a release date soon after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/"> gameplay trailer we saw earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Also, it's a State of Play event, which doesn't always feature first-party PlayStation games, but it wouldn't be too outlandish to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">Ghost of Yotei</a> once more, or even just the news that a specialized Ghost of Yotei event is coming ahead of that game's launch in October. We'll have to see what tomorrow holds.</p>
