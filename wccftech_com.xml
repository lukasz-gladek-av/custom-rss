            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was practically a given following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the mass layoffs at Amazon Game Studios</a>, but we now have confirmation that New World, the MMORPG developed by the team based in Irvine, California, is effectively on life support.</p>



<p>Amazon has clarified that Season 10: Nighthaven, which launched earlier this month, will be the last content update because further development 'is not sustainable'. The servers are, however, guaranteed to remain up throughout December 31, 2026 at the least. Complete closure of the servers will likely follow shortly after that date, although Amazon said it will notify players at least six months before that happens.</p>



<p>For now, the game and its in-game currency remain purchasable on all platforms, and New World also remains playable on PlayStation 5 for PlayStation Plus subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers. Again, when that changes, Amazon will send a notice.</p>



<p>The MMORPG was the first big project financed by Amazon as part of its gaming initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-reveals-breakaway-new-world-crucible-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was originally revealed at TwitchCon 2016</a> alongside the MOBA Breakway and the third-person shooter game Crucible, which however were canceled before or shortly after their launch.</p>



<p>New World, on the other hand, kept going, albeit with a few delays. The original vision was for a sandbox-style PvP focused MMORPG, but the team pivoted to a more traditional PvE game with dungeons and story missions while still retained some PvP elements from the previous design.</p>



<p>As someone who followed the game throughout its entire development and then spent a couple of hundred hours playing it, I can say that this confusing design was among the game's biggest failures. While a lot of people were hyped for its release in September 2021 as the first Western-made AAA MMORPG to launch since 2014's The Elder Scrolls Online, leading to a strong debut that <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even Jeff Bezos praising the team</a>, it became immediately clear that there wasn't nearly enough PvE content to keep PvE players interested. On the other hand, the PvP limitations (optional flagging, no looting, etc.) that were introduced to cater to those PvE players ensured that even the PvP niche was not satisfied.</p>



<p>The game could only keep me and my guild interested for two months before boredom inevitably set in. Overall, players left in droves. To their credit, the developers started working on more PvE content, as evidenced by the following updates, the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year's Aeternum rebrand and console launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, it was simply not enough to turn the tide. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final attempt with Season 10: Nighthaven</a> actually caught the interest of MMO fans, allowing the game to rebound and bringing back long server queues, but it was probably too little, too late at that point, as Amazon had already decided to close down the project.</p>



<p>So far, Amazon has not clarified what will happen to The Lord of the Rings MMO project, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revived two years ago</a>. It is most likely dead, too, but we have asked for an official statement on the matter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Remedy Entertainment published <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Q3 2025 financial report</a>. As expected, it's not great news for the Finnish studio. Tero Virtala, the company's CEO for nine years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">stepped do</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">n earlier this month</a> after Remedy told investors that the game FBC: Firebreak had effectively failed.</p>



<p>This past quarter, just as the studio celebrated the thirty years since its foundation, the financial highlights were indeed very negative:</p>



<ul>
<li>Revenue decreased by -32.0% to € 12.2 (17.9) million.</li>



<li>EBITDA was € 0.7 (6.6) million.</li>



<li>Operating profit (EBIT) was € -16.4 (2.4) million, and the operating profit margin was -135.1% (13.4%) of revenue.</li>



<li>Cash flow from operations was € 11.3 (8.0) million.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, interim CEO Markus Mäki reassured investors (and fans) that the remaining projects are on track, and the studio is still confident in its ability to achieve 'significant commercial success' by 2030.</p>



<p><em>Despite challenges with FBC: Firebreak, our other in-development projects are progressing according to plan. The majority of our effort goes into working with our established franchises – Control and Alan Wake – which we continue to invest in and expand into other media as part of our long-term strategy. In addition, we’re focused on the Max Payne 1&amp;2 remake with Rockstar Games. While carefully balancing our product risk, we also need to retain the ability to create new experiences for our audiences, as we have for the past 30 years. We aren’t satisfied with our recent financial performance, but we remain confident in our ability to create great video games that resonate with players and which are commercially successful, leading us back to profitability.</em></p>



<p>Remedy has set for itself the following financial targets:</p>



<ul>
<li>To reach a revenue two times higher than last year's by 2027 and then maintain continued growth beyond this milestone.</li>



<li>To achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 30% by 2027 and keep it afterward. </li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control 2</a> and the Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes are still in full production, and there's also a new project in the proof of concept phase. Given that the studio is focused on growing its two franchises, Control and Alan Wake, which are part of the same 'Remedy Connected Universe', the new project is likely also set in one of them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-%E2%80%93-achieve-s-rank-easily-in-all-missions-with-this-trick.1337902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With its many accessibility options, Ninja Gaiden 4 is one of the most approachable entries in the series, allowing players to experience its high-speed action without letting the high challenge level get in the way of enjoyment.</p>



<p> Those who want to truly appreciate the game, however, will wish to master many of its intricacies, put their skills to the test, and attempt to achieve an S rank for completing each of the story chapters.</p>



<p>Here are some tips to help you understand the mission scoring system and what you should always strive to do to achieve such a high rank.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: Tips and strategies tested in S rank mission completions at Normal and Hard difficulty over a total of 40+ hours in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-achieve-a-guaranteed-s-rank-in-ninja-gaiden-4">How To Achieve A Guaranteed S Rank in Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Your total completion rank for any mission in Ninja Gaiden, whether in Story Mode or Chapter Select mode, is decided by the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">total Karma score</strong>. Once it exceeds certain thresholds, the rank increases, up to the Master Ninja S Rank. This score depends on the obtained Technique Points, the total number of kills, Clear Time, and the Items Used and Deaths multipliers. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">These two multipliers are key to achieving a guaranteed S rank in all missions, regardless of difficulty.</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Imperfect-Run-S-Rank-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>A No Item Run of any Mission makes it possible to achieve S rank even if you don't take down every enemy in a mission</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, completing any Mission without using any item and without dying grants <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a 1.2x multiplier</strong> for your Karma score, which ensures even a lower Technique, Kills, and Clear Time score can surpass the threshold to achieve the highest rank, as you can see in my imperfect Mission 03 Normal Mode run above. Dying even once, however, will reduce your total Karma score with a negative multiplier, making it impossible to achieve S rank, so it should be avoided at all costs in S rank runs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">While achieving a No Item, No Death run of any Mission can be a challenge even at Normal difficulty, you can abuse the game's checkpoint system to avoid repeating runs from the beginning. Whenever your health gets into Critical Condition, as signaled by the visual noise on screen, open the menu and pick the Restart from Checkpoint option before you are defeated. This will bring warp you back to the nearest Terminal or Muramasa statue, with no penalty whatsoever. This is a classic PlatinumGames trick that works great in Ninja Gaiden 4</em> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">as well.</em></strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: The above trick has yet to be tested in Master Ninja mode, as its very high difficulty makes it challenging to even just complete a mission, let alone go for an S rank. Considering how this trick worked in almost every other action game developed by PlatinumGames at the highest difficulty, it should work just as well at Master Ninja mode. The guide will be updated with the confirmation once thorough testing has been conducted</strong></em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Romero Says He’s Talking with Many Companies to Finish the Game That Was Being Funded by Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-romero-talking-companies-finish-game-funded-by-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-romero-says-he%E2%80%99s-talking-with-many-companies-to-finish-the-game-that-was-being-funded-by-microsoft.1337854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>John Romero might not be a name that youngsters recognize, but he was a legend of the early days of the first-person shooter genre, co-founding id Software and making videogames like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Hexen, and Quake, to name a few. </p>



<p>Nowadays, he makes smaller titles at Romero Games. The studio's most recent title was the Mafia-themed turn-based strategy game Empire of Sin, launched in late 2020 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/empire-of-sin-disorganized-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a mixed reception</a>. More recently, John Romero and his fellow developers signed a deal with Microsoft for their next project, but that deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went awry along with the latest Xbox layoffs</a>. The development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not shut down</a>, though, and Romero himself <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/john-romero-we-were-about-midway-through-our-game-1624993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has provided an update to Gamereactor</a> in an interview conducted at San Diego Comic Con Malaga. The game was halfway done, and many publishers are interested in helping with funding.</p>



<p><em>We're still figuring out what we're going to do with our big game. We own the intellectual property, we own the code, we own everything about the game. So, we have a lot of companies that are interested and still working with us on it, because when you develop a game for years and you put in, say, $50 million into a game, if you move and start working with somebody else, they get $50 million for free. So lots of people want to continue working on something, and even if that doesn't happen, you have $50 million worth of assets that you can use to make another thing. So no matter what, you are shortcutting the end of your game, right? To be able to get your game done faster, you already have a lot there already. We were about midway through our game.</em></p>



<p>Here's hoping that John Romero can find a solid publisher to bring the game through the finish line. We've already had more than enough game cancellations for this year, at least as far as I'm concerned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-we%E2%80%99re-now-the-largest-gaming-publisher-and-want-to-be-everywhere-the-real-competitor-is-tiktok.1337845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d8dA8GtE8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a live interview on TBPN</a> (Technology Business Programming Network) discussing various topics, including the company's updated multiplatform strategy on the gaming front.</p>



<p>Nadella pointed out that following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the largest gaming publisher in terms of revenue. The goal, then, is to be everywhere the consumer is, just like with Office. The Microsoft CEO then interestingly referred to TikTok, or, to be more accurate, short-form video as a whole, as the true competitor of gaming.</p>



<p><em>Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business. And of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it. So to us, the way we're thinking about gaming is - first of all, now we're the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore, we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office.</em> <em>We're going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the PC, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>



<p><em>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward. So, I'm very looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly, the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well, because after all, the gaming's competition is not other gaming. Gaming's competition is short form video.</em></p>



<p>The Microsoft CEO clearly refers to the fact that every entertainment bit competes for the user's attention on any given day. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the New York Times</a>, following the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> and all future Halo titles would also launch on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Game Studios president Matt Booty shared a similar comment, mentioning that everything from movies to TikTok constitutes competition nowadays.</p>



<p>During the TBPN interview, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella made another statement that might irk some people in the industry. On one hand, he stressed the need to continuously innovate to keep consumers' attention; on the other, he said that to do that, it is necessary to have 'good margins'.</p>



<p><em>If we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model, right? Best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund.</em></p>



<p>However, it is a tone-deaf statement following the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> that have hit Microsoft as a whole and the gaming divisions specifically in the past couple of years. Meanwhile, Nadella's own pay grew 22% year-over-year and reached the astounding sum of $96.5 million.</p>
