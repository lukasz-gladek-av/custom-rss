			<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-2k-mafia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the whole Mafia franchise is coming to GeForce NOW. This includes the classic titles, the remakes and remasters, and even the upcoming Mafia: The Old Country game, which will be available on the cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at launch on August 8</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Survival Machine (New release on Steam, May 7)</em></li>
<li><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Spirit of the North 2 (New release on Steam, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II (Classic) (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia III: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Towerborne (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On this GeForce NOW list, our David Carcasole has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> Revenge of the Savage Planet, which he found funny, beautiful, and yet tedious:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</em></p>
<p><em>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</em></p>

			<p>A DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5 fan-made remake is in development, and it's looking great with some advanced visual features in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The fan-made remake of the third main entry in the series by id Software is being worked on by Fran√ßois Montagud, who shared a look at the latest version of the remake in a new video. The new version of the remake, which is sadly not available for download publicly, features reworked visual and gameplay aspects to enhance the game's atmosphere and tension. These reworked features include improved dynamic lighting and FX, more reactive AI behaviors, updated shooting system with better visual feedback, reworked sound effects, and more. While far from perfect, it's undeniable how this tech demo gets a lot of things right, and some of its elements are downright impressive, such as the smoke behavior with the dead enemy at the 2:20 mark.</p>

<p>While the DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5. remake cannot be played right now, fans of the id Software series will soon be able to enjoy a new entry in the series with DOOM: The Dark Ages, which is launching next week on PC and consoles. The next entry in the series promises to be another excellent action-packed first-person shooter, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/"> hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</em></p>
