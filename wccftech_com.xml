			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> system software update is set to go live in a few hours, introducing features that beta testers have been able to try out for a few months.</p>



<p>As confirmed today, the next big system software update will roll out tomorrow, September 17. Once the update is live, the system will download it automatically. If not, the download and installation process can be started manually by going into the Settings menu, then picking System, System Software, System Software Update, and Settings.</p>



<p>The biggest additions of the upcoming new PlayStation 5 system software update are Power Saver mode and a new DualSense pairing option that allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices. Power Saver mode, which can be enabled via the Settings, System, Power Saving, and Use Power Saver menu options, will be further supported down the line with updates to already available games such as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Demon's Souls, while the soon-to-be-released Ghost of Yotei will support it at launch. This rather interesting reveal seems to support the idea that this new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver profile is targeting the specifications of the rumored PlayStation handheld system</a> that is supposedly releasing alongside the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>While Power Saver mode is an option that few are likely to use for the time being, the new PlayStation 5 system software update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-beta-program-ps5-pro-dualsense-pairing-update/">DualSense pairing option</a> is surely going to see wider usage, especially for those who use the controller on PC. Once the update is live, it will be possible to register up to four devices simultaneously and switch between them directly from the controller.</p>



<p>More information on the next PlayStation 5 system software update rolling out tomorrow can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the second half of September 2025, and following up from the first half, it's even more strong indie titles with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor among the over a dozen games being added, starting today.</p>



<p>Hades re-enters the subscription service just ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-launches-on-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-month/">Hades II launching into 1.0 on September 25</a>, giving players a chance to dive back into the first game before the first sequel that developer Supergiant has ever made hits its full release.</p>



<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the Deep Rock Galactic spin-off auto-shooter from Funday Games that's published by Ghost Ship's publishing arm. Like Hades II, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/">Survivor is launching out of early access</a> this month, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>



<p>Other notable titles coming for the rest of the month include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Frostpunk 2, Visions of Mana, and Sworn. There's also a game preview for Endless Legends II that'll be available on PC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of the month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Roadcraft - September 16 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>For the King II - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Overthrown (Game Preview) - September 17 - Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - September 17 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Frostpunk 2 - September 18 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Wobbly Life - September 18 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Hades - September 19 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (Game Preview) - September 22 - PC</li>



<li>Sworn - September 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Peppa Pig: World Adventures - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Visions of Mana - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - September 30 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>
</ul>



<p>And, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This time, it's a swell of Ninja Gaiden titles, with Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge all leaving the service, alongside Terra Invicta. They'll all be gone as of September 30, 2025.</p>

			<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics took players back in time to an era of fighting games that plenty of fans longed to see come back. At least more than a million of them, as Capcom confirms that the arcade collection has officially surpassed one million copies sold, nearly a year to the day after its launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's great to see a collection that does a great job of bringing these older fighting classics back into the spotlight hit this sales milestone, especially for everyone hoping that this will be the start of Capcom releasing a new entry into the series with a proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 4.</p>



<p>There's been no official word as to whether it'll happen, but more than a million copies is not something to scoff at, and while it's not a MARVEL vs. CAPCOM game, Capcom has surely been paying attention to the attention that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Arc System Works' Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> has been getting.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for the sake of MARVEL vs. CAPCOM fans, Capcom sees that there's room enough for both games.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">Wccftech reviewed the fighting collection last year</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em>"</p>
