<p>Though not a new Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest game, the first two Octopath Traveler games established the series as an important one for JRPG fans to pay attention to. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">Octopath Traveler</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, could easily be considered two of the best JRPGs to be released in the last decade. Now, Square Enix has continued the series with a prequel for the third installment, with Octopath Traveler 0. Here's everything we know about the turn-based prequel.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">first announced back in July 2025</a>. Its reveal trailer was included as part of Nintendo's Partner Showcase Direct in July, and its release date of December 4, 2025, was announced alongside its initial reveal. Revealing the project and announcing the release date all in one, approximately five months ahead of said release date, was a clear sign from the jump that this game was nearly finished and would not miss its release date from delays, which is exactly what happened.</p>



<p>A prologue demo was also released on November 11, which allows you to play the opening three hours of the game, with your progress carrying over into the full version, should you decide to purchase it after playing the demo. </p>



<p>The standard edition of the game costs $49.99, with the deluxe edition listed at $59.99. Pre-ordering either edition gets you the Travel Provisions downloadable content, which is essentially a bundle of in-game items that you start the game with to give you a leg-up without having to grind for them in the story. The Travel Provisions for pre-ordering either the standard or deluxe edition are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing Grape (M) x5</li>



<li>Inspiriting Plum (M) x5</li>



<li>Revitalizing Jam x2</li>



<li>Icewind Mastery</li>
</ul>



<p>If you pre-order the deluxe edition, not only do you get the items listed above, but you also get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Three Action Skills: Triple Strike Mastery, SP Saver Mastery, Extra JP Mastery</li>



<li>8 Types of Nuts (M): Fortifying Nut (M), Magic Nut (M), Tough Nut (M), Resistant Nut (M), Light Nut (M), Critical Nut (M), Sharp Nut (M), Slippery Nut (M)</li>



<li>Festive Town Decorations: Table with roasted chicken, Festive Arch, Large Festive Arch, Festive Flag, Grand Vase</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, the deluxe edition also gets you a digital art book. There's also a massive collector's edition that is <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/octopath-traveler-0">available exclusively from the Square Enix store</a> for $229.99, which includes everything listed above, along with, per the Square Enix store listing, "<em>a physical replica of the in-game key item, the Ring of the Flamebringer; an original-design deck of playing cards; a set of three 8-sided metal dice; a game mat for multiplayer fun; a specially edited art booklet; and an arrangement music CD, available here ahead of its market-wide release.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like the first two Octopath Traveler games before it, Octopath Traveler 0 is a turn-based JRPG presented in an HD-2D visual style, which blends 2D sprites with 3D environments. It's pixel-art based, and fans of the first two games would have no issue recognizing a screenshot from the game as an Octopath Traveler title.</p>



<p>Set within the fictional continent of Orsterra, unlike the first two games, which feature eight protagonists with their own individual stories, Octopath Traveler 0 focuses on a single protagonist created by the player. After customizing your appearance, voice, Job, and other unique aspects of your character, the journey begins in your hometown of Wishvale, which is tragically burned down by Hermania the witch, Tytos the hero, and Auguste the playwright at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p>It's then up to you to restore Wishvale and take revenge on the three villains who brought your home to ashes.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The tactical turn-based battles will be familiar to players, though there are a few significant changes like evolving from four characters in a battle to eight, giving you more opportunity to mix and match the jobs, action skills, and abilities at your disposal when in a fight. The game also introduces Ultimate Techniques, which you'll learn as the story progresses and allows you to deliver a powerful blow to your enemies in battles, particularly if you wait until your available Ultimate Technique is powered up to its level three maximum.</p>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 also features a new branch of gameplay with the restoration of Wishvale. You'll get to manage elements of Wishvale's rebuild by establishing different facilities and customizing them. Rebuilding Wishvale and upgrading the town's facilities also unlocks key features to the gameplay and provides a mix of things to do in between your adventuring.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As an HD-2D game with a pixel-art design, Octopath Traveler 0 is by no means a demanding game for any platform.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications from the game's Steam page:</p>



<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong></p>
