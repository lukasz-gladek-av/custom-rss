			<p>Today, Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1917959352243098073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Apex Legends: Prodigy season will begin on Tuesday, May 6, delivering a new playable hero called Sparrow.</p>
<p>His real name is Enea Davide Guarino. According to the lore prepared by the developers, he was born into the most respected bounty hunter clan in the Outlands, renowned for their unparalleled archery skills and dogmatic moral code. Guarino, a young and irreverent rogue, quickly became the black sheep of his clan. After a particularly reckless decision, it became clear they would never see eye to eye, and his family shunned Enea.</p>
<p>Despite this, Sparrow is determined to figure out how to have it allâ€”a life on his own terms and his family's acceptance. The child prodigy hopes to regain his family's respect by participating in the Apex Games. For the first two weeks of the Apex Legends: Prodigy season, Sparrow will be temporarily unlocked for all players. Players will have the opportunity to add Sparrow to their permanent pantheon of Legends by completing challenges that will test their skills with Legends, weapons, and damage.</p>
<p>Sparrow's passive is Double Jump. Players can jump twice as high by pressing the button a second time while in the air. Moreover, when climbing a wall and hitting a double jump, they'll launch right up to the top of that wall. His tactical ability is a Tracker Dart that reveals all enemies passing through the area. Lastly, his Ultimate is Stinger Bolt. This ability lets Sparrow wreak havoc on multiple targets simultaneously with a large arrow that creates a damaging energy field. Anyone caught in the open and within line of sight is affected. More information about Sparrow will be released in a dedicated blog scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>

<p>Apex Legends: Prodigy also sees the return of the Bocek Compound Bow, which can be loaded with Frag Grenades and energized to create Explosive Arrows. Arena matches also return, albeit with some differences. Firstly, they are shorter, as the first team to win three rounds will be crowned champion. Throughout the season, weapons in the store will be banned for some time after being selected by a player, and a discount will kick off in certain rounds to tempt players away from their preferred weapons. Finally, Health items will be available at the beginning of the round. Later in the season, a new 1v1 Arena variant called Duels will make its debut.</p>
<p>Ranked mode is getting tweaked, too. The player's starting Rank Tier and Division will now be based on their (hidden) skill value from past seasons, and the Bronze reset rule for those who missed a season has been removed. The season also introduces Ranked Challenges and Ranked Ladders, giving players more stuff to chase. More details will be shared in the patch notes.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi teams at Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were just hit by significant layoffs</a>. This also caused the cancellation of two early projects at the incubation stage, one of which would have been a Titanfall extraction shooter.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-predictions-for-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-half-life-to-return-major-ubisoft-changes/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first revealed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">six years ago</a> now, in 2019, two years after the original Hollow Knight came out and set a new standard for 2D Metroidvanias. Since then, players have been keenly waiting for any news about the coming sequel, and when we'd finally get the chance to play it.</p>
<p>If you're incredibly keen, you might get your first chance to play it this coming September 18, 2025, because a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a> has confirmed that it will be playable by then. As part of an exhibit inside a museum in Australia, that is.</p>
<p>Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture, ACMI, is hosting a game-focused exhibit in September called Game Worlds, which will include a playable build of Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>The hope now, is that this news means that it'll be playable outside of an Australian museum by then. Surely it wouldn't be available in this museum's exhibit, and not already be out everywhere in the world, right?</p>
<p>It would be a strange situation if that ended up being the case, but it feels very unlikely. We know that developer Team Cherry is targeting a 2025 launch, so then the museum exhibit's September 18 date means we should be looking at a release date for Silksong arriving at least a little before that.</p>
<p>It could arrive in August, or perhaps the exhibit will be part of Silksong's launch. Team Cherry is based in Southern Australia, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if the studio wanted to put its home on the map a little more with the launch of one of the world's most anticipated indie games.</p>
<p>If a summer release date is what we have to look forward to, then that means we could be looking at a Summer Game Fest release date reveal. Not that Silksong needs a larger event around it to bring eyes to any news about the game, but it would fit the kind of big reveals Geoff Keighley strives to include in his annual showcases.</p>
