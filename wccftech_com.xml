			<p>When Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 would be launching on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">October 3, 2025</a>, before delivering the news, he started to act as if he was about to deliver bad news, that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game wasn't going to make it out before the end of 2025. He then happily and excitedly announced that it would be arriving on October 3.</p>



<p>Well, so much for that. This evening, Gearbox took to the <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">official Borderlands X (formerly Twitter) account</a> to announce that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 has been delayed. It will no longer be released on October 3. In fact, we don't know when it will be released, because Gearbox didn't provide a new release date or release window, and we'll just have to wait for an update when Gearbox has "<em>fully adjusted</em>" its plans.</p>



<p>On top of that, in line with Nintendo's eShop policy, all digital pre-orders of the game are being cancelled, so you'll have to pre-order it again whenever a new date is announced. You can go ahead and cancel your pre-order yourself, or it will happen automatically this Friday, September 26, 2025. If you have a physical pre-order, you'll have to deal with the retailer you got it from to figure out your next steps there.</p>



<p>"<em>Greetings, Vault Hunters,</em>" the studio began in its statement. "<em>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we've fully adjusted our plans</em>."</p>

<p>It's unfortunate news for Borderlands fans who were hoping to play Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, if it had kept its original release date, but it's not exactly surprising considering the myriad of technical issues the game has faced on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it makes it out before the end of this year, which would make Pitchford's joke from his video in July still applicable. Though between all the fixes Gearbox is trying to implement on the versions of the game that's already out in players' hands, it can't help but feel unlikely that the Switch 2 version will be pushed to the back of the priority line, and we won't see it arrive until 2026.</p>
