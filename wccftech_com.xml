			<p>Developed by Funday Games and published by Ghost Ship Games, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the rougelike auto-shooter spin-off of first-person co-op mining shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deep-rock-galactic-a-dwarf-is-always-a-dwarf-even-in-space/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>. The top-down adventure launched in early access on Steam in February 2024, and Ghost Ship Games announced today it'll launch out of early access later this year.</p>
<p>Announced during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor will hit its 1.0 launch on <strong>September 17, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>It'll be available on PC through Steam at launch, though hopefully, once it hits 1.0, we'll hear something about when it'll be moving to consoles.</p>
<p>Over 1 million players have already dived into Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor since its release a little more than a year ago, and in that time, Funday Games has released multiple new biomes and characters for players to try out, with more sure to come when its 1.0 release arrives.</p>
<p>Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, which has a co-op focus, Survivor is a single-player game that challenges players to take down waves of hordes of aliens. At the same time, you search for anything and everything shiny and valuable.</p>
<p>Funday Games promises that the 1.0 update will be "<em>the biggest update we've ever made</em>," though the exact details of the update remain unclear. Fans are hoping that it will include the anticipated endless mode, which was previously delayed from the last content update for Survivor, as Funday Games opted to focus on getting Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor ready for its September 1.0 release instead.</p>

<p>The trailer for its release date does show players, though, that a new mechanic, 'Gear,' will be added with 1.0. Unfortunately, we don't have any concrete answers to how players get it, what functions gear has, or any other questions players have about it. Funday is holding off on those details until the game's release is closer.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor's release date wasn't the only news from Ghost Ship Games during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, as we also got word that a closed alpha test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> will be taking place soon, ahead of the game's early access launch. You can sign up for a chance to participate in that playtest on Rogue Core's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">Steam page</a>.</p>

			<p>ZeniMax Online Studio has unveiled its 2025 plans for Elder Scrolls Online. As you might recall, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the transition away from the yearly Chapter model toward a more seasonal content release cadence.</p>
<p>This begins with Seasons of the Worm Cult, which marks the return of the enemy faction originally seen in the base game's main storyline. Indeed, this will be a continuation of that storyline after over ten years, with many fan-favorite characters like Razum-dar, Skordo, Gabrielle, and Vanus Galerion making a comeback for the occasion. Elder Scrolls Online will also be updated with a new zone called Solstice, a tropical island where Argonians and High Elves live together. The main city is called Sunport, and it's run by Corelanya Elves and Tideborn Argonians, mostly outcasts from the respective races. The latter are actually a new Argonian tribe that hasn't been seen before in Elder Scrolls Online, though there are also new Argonian Behemoths and Stone Argonians on Solstice that players will encounter as foes.</p>
<p>It's here that players will face off against the Worm Cult once again. Initially, though, they'll only be able to access half of the island. One of the twists is that there will be a server-wide event to take down the so-called Writhing Wall erected by the necromancers and access the rest of the island. The whole community will participate in this event (which is set to begin in late Summer), even those who do not purchase the new content pass, which is essentially the equivalent of the old Chapter.</p>

<p>It reminds me of something like The Gates of Ahn'Quiraj, a server-wide event in vanilla World of Warcraft where individual player contributions determined exactly when any given server would get access to the raid. Of course, whereas World of Warcraft had many servers in each region, the same is not true for Elder Scrolls Online, which employs a megaserver structure where there is only a single server per region (and platform). In this case, players will aid the Fellowship of Stirk in taking down the Writhing Wall.</p>
<p>Anyway, the biggest addition to the game is actually something else entirely: the developers are introducing full-fledged subclassing. That's right, once you have at least a character at level 50, you'll be able to access skill lines from other classes, although you will always have to maintain at least one skill line from the original class that you picked during character creation. This means that a Templar character could add one skill line from Dragon Knight and another from Sorcerer, and this is just one of many possible examples. According to the developers, there are now over three thousand combinations of skill lines. Critically, there will be an account-wide progression for all skill lines. This means that if you have already unlocked a skill line with one character, you can use that skill line on any other of your characters through subclassing.</p>

<p>As for Season of the Worm Cult, a Prologue Quest is available today, but the first real part of the new story will be delivered in June, with the rest coming throughout 2025, starting with a second update in late Summer. With the June patch (Update 46), ZeniMax is also adding the new 12-player Trial called Ossein Cage, a gigantic vault located in Coldharbour, Molag Bal's Daedric realm. Ossein Cage holds a powerful relic called Dolorous Cista that absorbs pain and transforms it into power; it's up to the players to prevent Molag Bal and his Daedric servants from getting their hands on it.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Online also stressed that work continues on a variety of other aspects, from PvP (especially RvR, following the Cyrodiil Champions test) to revamping the new player experience, the returning player experience, the graphics look of the game, and the combat feel, and the user interface on PC.

As a side note, the game has now reached over 26 million players since launch, up from the 25-million milestone of a few months ago.</p>
