			<p>For years now, Tencent has been placing investments across the video game industry, acquiring stakes in a variety of companies and, in some cases, acquiring them entirely. It's been a slow-burning strategy that has undoubtedly paid off, as exemplified in a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/tencent-goes-hands-on-to-reshape-10-billion-global-games-empire?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTM3MzA1NywiZXhwIjoxNzY1OTc3ODU3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjdZOFdLR0NURlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2RjZBMkE0Njg3MjI0Q0I1ODNBQkMwQTNDRDI0RDM5OCJ9.uRCAYv2eub16WLwH8iuw-3CIHjLxG2B4hP4gOF4G9AU">Bloomberg</a> report where chief executive officer Michelle Liu discusses her methodology that helped Tencent generate <strong>$10 billion in revenue</strong> over the past year.</p>



<p>Not only did the report include the gargantuan sales record, but it also included a few notable bits of information on how Tencent treats its relationships with the studios it acquires. Dune: Awakening developer Funcom and Dying Light: The Beast developer Techland are mentioned specifically as having benefitted from Liu and Tencent's guidance.</p>



<p>"<em>If they could already achieve everything on their own, what would they need me for?</em>" Liu said. "Tencent has a lot of experience with data analysis, benchmarks, and criteria." Experience that has clearly benefitted its partners and the studios it acquired.</p>



<p>The chart below shows just how much bigger Tencent is than other major game publishers and platforms like Roblox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">even as Roblox smashes concurrent player count records</a>.</p>

<p>"<em>We can always count on an extra point of view that helps us to improve the game</em>," said Techland founder Pawel Marchewka regarding Tencent's guidance in an interview at Gamescom 2025. Funcom chief executive officer Rui Casais added, at a separate Gamescom interview, "<em>When Tencent came in, they said, 'Look, you're spreading your attention.' You have a great IP that you've secured, you should really focus on that and drop the other things</em>."</p>



<p>While Funcom has not been able to avoid layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">Dune: Awakening was the studio's biggest launch in its entire history</a>. Techland was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/">sell over a million copies of Dying Light: The Beast at launch on Steam alone,</a> not including those players who got it for free as part of the Dying Light 2: Stay Human bundle they had purchased.</p>



<p>Of course, it's the teams that worked on those games that deserve the credit for their successes, but Liu's earlier point still stands, and it's becoming clear that Tencent is capable of directing teams to success. We'll see if that continues to be the case <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">with its new venture with Ubisoft and Vantage Studios</a>, but $10 billion in revenue is nothing to shake your stick at.</p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, is undoubtedly one of the defining games for 2025. Not only is it one of the most beloved titles of the year and the heavy favourite to win Game of the Year at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> this evening (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after it swept the Golden Joysticks</a>), it's one of the greatest success stories this year of an independent team made up of former Ubisoft developers coming together to prove, at least to themselves, that they could make the game they wanted to make, and that it would resonate with players.</p>



<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m7ps6x4vgk2h">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>) reveals that's not all the studio wanted to prove. According to the report, not only did Sandfall Interactive keep the cost of Clair Obscur's development under $10 million, but it did so to prove that it didn't need to spend a crazy amount of money on a game to make something incredible.</p>



<p>"<em>Sandfall wanted to prove that indie studios were capable of making prestige games at a fraction of the budget and personnel of larger studios</em>," the report reads.</p>







<p>Now, you're probably thinking that there have been countless indies before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that proved you could make a top-tier game at a fraction of the budget that major publishers like Activision pour into Call of Duty every year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">and still they can't seem to get it right</a>.</p>



<p>Several games in the last two years alone proved you don't need to spend a ton of money to make something that captivates the entire industry, see Hollow Knight Silksong, Animal Well, Blue Prince, Hades 2, etc. But those games, and many like them, don't include big-name voice actors behind their characters, let alone big-name Hollywood actors. They don't include the kind of cinematic triumphs included in Clair Obscur, and they don't reach the level of triple-A polish that we're more accustomed to seeing from the likes of Rockstar, Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, Activision, Obsidian, and more.</p>



<p>It is incredibly impressive that Sandfall was able to accomplish what it did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and it feels more than deserving of the accolades it has been given since it launched earlier this year. Tonight, it has the chance to add to its list of accolades, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">with its record-setting 12 nominations at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched in April this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave it a 9.5/10 in his review, writing</a>, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>
