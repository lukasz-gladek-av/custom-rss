			<p>Legendary RPG designer and writer Chris Avellone is joining Republic Games, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2024 by former Quantic Dream writer Adam Williams. Their project is a dark, mature fantasy RPG, which sounds like the perfect game for Chris Avellone to work on, given that his credits include Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyranny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/torment-tides-numenera-review-tides-shifted-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>, Prey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divinity: Original Sin II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alaloth-champions-of-the-four-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</a>.</p>
<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/adamwilliam_/status/1938233299442249816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> on X by Adam Williams, who commented:</p>
<p><em>Chris has written, created, and designed for some of the greatest RPGs of all time. He’s a master of interactive storytelling. On our list of people to work with, he was at the top.</em></p>
<p><em>Chris was at the forefront of the golden age of RPGs. We are creating a dark fantasy story with immersive gameplay and a rich interactive narrative which aims to recapture that magic -- and take it to the next level. Everybody at the studio is very excited – we’re building a dream team.</em></p>
<p>In a statement shared with a press release, Avellone said:</p>
<p><em>When Adam shared his vision and design for his upcoming title, I asked if I could collaborate, and Adam was more than willing to bring me on board as part of the team. I love the design principles he’s outlining for the game, and even better, I love the narrative construction he’s implementing as well. To be a part of it on the ground floor is pretty amazing, and it’s a rare opportunity in the industry.</em></p>
<p>In the press release, it was also confirmed that player choices will heavily influence the story and alter the destiny of the player character and the world. The story will also feature multiple endings.</p>
<p>Chris Avellone was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-accused-of-sexual-harassment-misconduct-several-studios-cut-ties-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject</a> of sexual harassment/misconduct allegations in June 2020 by two women. Consequently, Techland, Gato Salvaje, and Paradox Interactive cut ties with him; at the time, he was working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-waylanders-harsh-life-celtic-warrior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Waylanders</a>, and Vampire: The Masquerades - Bloodlines 2 (before Paradox replaced Hardsuit Labs with The Chinese Room).</p>
<p>A year later, Avellone <a href="https://chrisavellone.medium.com/ending-silence-c48e86f7c523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a lengthy response to the allegations on Medium and also filed a libel suit in a California court. The case <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-case-has-been-resolved-sexual-allegation-claims-have-been-retracted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> two years ago, with the two women retracting their claims and paying Avellone a seven-figure compensation.</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening developer Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/">released the latest update</a> for the new large-scale survival game, which adds the changes that creative director<a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/"> Joel Bylos recently announced</a>, including changes to ornithopters, the removal of restrictions for visiting sietches, and most significantly, making areas of the Deep Desert PvE zones, to help improve the endgame experience for solo players and those who don't want to engage in the intense PvP gameplay the Deep Desert has become known for.</p>
<p>The entire southern half of the Deep Desert map is now a PvE zone, allowing players who don't want to engage in PvP to harvest and look for high-value resources without having to venture further into the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>That said, there is a greater density of high-value resources if you do venture further north into the Deep Desert and PvP areas. The high risk of engaging in PvP will always grant the highest reward for those willing to take on the risk.</p>
<p>Plasteel plates, for example, can still only be found in PvP zones. The number of active medium spice fields has also been reduced from 8 to 6, while the number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22, and the largest spice fields will still only be found in the north of the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>The Titanium and Stravidium spawn rate has also been reduced in PvE zones, which means that the only way to find large quantities of either will once again be to travel to the PvP regions of the Deep Desert. The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has also been increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Regarding vehicles, the major changes are for the Scout Ornithopters, which now have their speed and maneuverability decreased, should you decide to equip yours with rocket launchers. It's a 20% speed decrease for Scout Ornithopters and a 10% decrease for Assault Ornithopters.</p>
<p>The last few notable aspects of this patch are the restrictions on visiting other sietches being lifted, with any player now able to go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want, and a slew of bug fixes and stability improvements. Beyond that, the last notable aspect of this patch is what it lacks - the changes to the Landsraad that Bylos mentioned in his previous statement.</p>
<p>All of these changes to Dune: Awakening have been met with a mixed reception from players. Some, notably those who have been engaging with PvP, think Funcom already had the right balance. Others, namely those who don't want to engage in PvP, think these changes are for the better. Either way, Funcom has been clear that the team will continue to adapt and balance the game per player feedback. It'll be interesting to see how it evolves over the course of the year, especially when Funcom reveals the<a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/"> first major content drop in a few months time.</a></p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is more likely to be held back by software limitations, some of them shared with its predecessor, than hardware limitations.</p>
<p>Speaking in the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells commented on some of the Nintendo Switch 2 software limitations that could impact game performance. Among them are the FAT32 and exFAT file systems, which both the original Switch and the new generation system use. These dated file systems have all sorts of drawbacks over other file systems, such as the 4GB file size limit of FAT32, which leads to issues such as forcing developers to use smaller files, which can limit texture quality, or dividing files into chunks. Regarding this, the Alderon Games founder finds it baffling that Nintendo continues to use these dated file systems, as they also pay a licensing fee to Microsoft to use them with no concrete benefit. PlayStation consoles, for example, use their file systems based on Linux free file systems, and so have none of the limitations of FAT32 and exFAT.</p>
<p>This isn't the only software limitation the Nintendo Switch 2 has that the other consoles don't. While developers can work around the file size limit, Nintendo puts another limitation on top of it. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo keeps a strict limit on how many times a game can write data on the NAND to prevent it from dying too soon, which is thoroughly checked in the rigorous approval process for both new games and updates. According to the Alderon Games founder, this is a limitation forced by the company's choice of cheap NAND, which poses the question of whether these limitations are worth the little Nintendo saves on these chips. Additionally, these limitations become even worse if other factors are considered, such as the system reserving a lot of resources for the OS and GameChat, and the massive usage of encryption and DRM, which is not surprising, considering Nintendo's stance on hacking and piracy.</p>
<p>Though this will likely become less of an issue down the line, the Alderon Games founder also lamented the lack of Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which only a few developers own. As such, many developers who want to continue supporting their games on the new system have to do a lot of guesswork and hope the build they are submitting works flawlessly on it.</p>

<p>While some of these limitations could impact games more down the line, they are not exactly a problem right now for users, as the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving to be extremely successful, and has shown what it can do in the hands of expert developers such as CD Projekt Red with the Cyberpunk 2077 port. You can learn more about the system and how it is a significant improvement over its predecessor by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
