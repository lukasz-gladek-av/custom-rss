			<p>Microsoft has been heavily criticized by some of its fans for sharing Xbox exclusives with rival platforms like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch consoles. On one hand, this has inevitably aggravated the issue of Xbox hardware sales, which have admittedly been on the decline for some time. On the other hand, though, the change of policy appears to be starting to pay dividends for the Redmond-based giant.</p>



<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director &amp; Video Game Industry Analyst at Circana (formerly NPD), has shared the following chart from the firm's upcoming Q2 Games Market Dynamics report <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3luzr5q2qac27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Q2 2025 Top 10 Best-Selling Games on PlayStation Platforms</td><td>(Physical and Full Game Digital from digital data sharing publishers in the Digital Leader Panel)</td><td> Ranked on Dollar Sales </td><td>Reporting Period: April 6-July 5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Quarter Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Sony (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>NEW</td><td>Doom: The Dark Ages</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>NEW</td><td>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</td><td>Ubisoft</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>WWE 2K25</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In Q2 2025, Microsoft practically dominated the PlayStation Top 10 chart in the United States with five games: the evergreen Minecraft, the steady <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, and the newly released ports of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The Top 10 chart is completed by Sony's MLB: The Show 25 (also a multiplatform game), Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows, another evergreen (Grand Theft Auto V), and WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>It could even be argued that the revenue Microsoft is getting from PlayStation (and Nintendo) platforms will essentially cover the lost revenue caused by putting those games on Game Pass on Microsoft's Xbox and PC. In that light, the switch to multiplatform might suddenly be much more palatable.</p>



<p>Circana has also shared the overall Top 10 best-selling games in the United States this past month:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Month Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Elden Ring: Nightreign</td><td>Bandai Namco Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>NEW</td><td>Mario Kart World</td><td>Nintendo</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>185</td><td>Stellar Blade</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>NEW</td><td>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</td><td>Marvelous Entertainment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

			<p>The upcoming MMORPG Chrono Odyssey recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first limited-time Closed Beta test on Steam</a>, and the first impressions weren't exactly lavish in praise. The game featured several performance, balance, and polish issues, all of which are being addressed by South Korean developer Chrono Studio.</p>



<p>This morning, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2873440/view/532104920883537322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the second part of its CBT Notes. Earlier this month, they had addressed some key concerns regarding animation and combat responsiveness and performance, promising the addition of popular upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>



<p>Today, though, the studio addressed in great detail the changes coming to most of the systems seen in the Chrono Odyssey beta. For combat, input responsiveness is being significantly improved through several tweaks, including better client-server packet transmission and optimized network performance. Hit reactions will occur more frequently and include knockback effects, making them easier to recognize; the duration of crowd control effects (CC) will be increased to 2-4 seconds, allowing more opportunities for follow-up attacks. Damage feedback is also being enhanced, with new hit reaction animations added based on the type of enemy attack, improving the visibility of effects like stagger and knockback, and sound and camera effects introduced to improve the feeling of impact. Weapon sweeping will feel faster, too, thanks to a shortened buffer window.</p>



<p>The skill system is also changing. Each weapon will support four combat styles, and skills across different weapons will synergize. A skill tree node system called Matrix will be added to provide different progression paths for all these playstyles. Needless to say, all classes in Chrono Odyssey will have to be rebalanced following this change.</p>



<p>Monster AI will be improved to ensure monsters respond more effectively to ranged attacks, and Chrono Studio is also planning to smooth those frankly ridiculous difficulty spikes that players ran into during the Closed Beta. </p>



<p>Even the game world is changing. Visually, region-specific features such as swamps, misty forests, wildflower fields, and grasslands will strengthen visual identity, and a dynamic grass system will be implemented, and the wind system will be improved to create immersive environmental interactions.</p>



<p>To make exploration more rewarding, the team plans to increase content density and introduce new exploration elements, such as themed caves, narrative encounters, and gathering opportunities at points of interest (POIs). New Dynamic Quests and Chain Quests will also be added, with hidden rewards such as rare achievements and exclusive titles as incentives to explore.</p>



<p>Beyond the main questline, meaningful events and quests are being introduced to Chrono Odyssey with unique, memorable characters tailored to each region. Certain quests will even offer player choices that influence their progression and conclusion. </p>



<p>Expedition Dungeons will include randomized elements to make each run unique. Depending on the path taken, players may encounter different bosses, treasure chests, and other events, creating a more dynamic experience. Replayability will be encouraged as well with the introduction of additional rewards for completing the same dungeon multiple times.</p>



<p>There's also a veritable mountain of smaller tweaks to the user interface, crafting system, tutorials, and social systems. While it's fantastic that Chrono Studio has addressed the user feedback in such amazing depth and is willing to improve the game in many core areas, the downside of that is the near-inevitable delay. Chrono Odyssey is currently still slated for 2025, but with all these changes on the way and the prospect of <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-qa-multiple-closed-beta-tests-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future beta tests</a> to evaluate them, it seems obvious that the game won't be released this year. Still, better to wait for a solid product than rush something out.</p>
