			<p>One of PlayStation's announcements during its Summer Game Fest-timed State of Play was the introduction of a new wireless fight stick from the company, announced at the time under the name "<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/">Project Defiant</a></em>." Today, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/28/new-details-on-playstations-first-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike/">PlayStation Blog</a> post, the official name for the fight stick, FlexStrike, was revealed, along with a new trailer showcasing its features and the news that it'll be out sometime next year. </p>

<p>"<em>Compatible with PS5 or PC via a wired connection or wirelessly with PlayStation Link, our innovative ultra-low latency wireless technology, FlexStrike wireless fight stick features mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates,"</em> writes Edwin Foo, vice president of product development at Sony. "<em>These include square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that fit into the fight stick’s built-in storage compartments alongside the included PS Link USB adapter."</em></p>



<p>You'll be able to use it wirelessly with a USB-A dongle in the front or back of your PS5 or PC, or use it with a wired USB-C connection. You can have a DualSense controller connected to your PS5 simultaneously with the FlexStrike, to help navigate menus better, and as the trailer shows off, its wireless connection is Sony's new PlayStation Link, which is how all its most recent wireless peripherals connect to PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>It'll be at EVO 2025, but if you're at the event, you won't be able to try it. PlayStation says it'll be there "<em>on display only</em>," so you can get a look at it and the carrying case it comes with when visiting the Arc System Works booth. More details on when players will actually be able to get their hands on it will probably arrive closer to its actual release date, sometime in 2026. </p>



<p>PlayStation has had a firm hand in the fighting game community for years, but this is the first time it is making its own fight stick for players to use. Whenever players do get their hands on it, especially the pros that might consider bringing it to EVO, it'll be interesting to see if it can usurp the fight sticks and gamepads they already prefer.</p>

			<p>The Astronauts, the studio behind early access first-person fantasy shooter Witchfire, have released the latest major update for the game, Webgrave, which adds an entire new region to explore called Velmorne, new weapons and gear for players hunt the Witch with, changes to player onboarding, quality of life improvements, and more. </p>



<p>A new trailer showcasing the update has also been debuted, going through several of the changes included in the update, mainly around how player progression and build crafting work in the update. Which is great for returning players, but for new players, and even some returning ones, the arrival of a new in-depth tutorial set on a new map before you're dropped into Hermitory is perhaps the biggest highlight of the update. </p>



<p>What's definitely a welcome feature for returning players is the introduction of a new difficulty level, Gnosis VI, to raise the stakes even higher if you've already found yourself running through Witchfire's challenges without issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Witchfire was first launched into early access on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/">Epic Games Store in 2023</a>, and then on Steam in <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/">September 2024</a>. The studio has continually updated and tweaked the game in response to feedback from players, and in a press release for today's update, The Astronauts co-founder and creative director, Adrian Chmielarz, thanked players for taking that journey with the studio.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to our early adopters! To all of you who have participated in our Early Access so far: Thank you very much for your help in getting us to this point</em>,<em>" </em>Chmielarz said. "<em>Your feedback in our official Discord and beyond has been vital!"</em></p>



<p>Witchfire will have been in early access for two years this coming September. Now that the game is getting a proper tutorial as part of this expansion, and an overhaul to its weapons and ability systems, it'll be interesting to see if we finally get word of a 1.0 release coming sometime next year.</p>

			<p>Glen Schofield is a name that horror video game fans have known since the arrival of the first Dead Space game in 2008. He's credited as the creator of the series, and even though he spent some time away from horror during his Call of Duty days in the 2010s, it's clear he was always pulled to the genre since he tried to return to it with The Callisto Protocol in 2022. He's worked in the video game industry for over two decades, with most of that time spent in AAA games. Now, he thinks it might all be coming to an end. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), Schofield ponders on the fact that he might have directed his last game when The Callisto Protocol released nearly three years ago now. He talks about what he's been doing for the last eight months, and how he has tried, and been unsuccessful, in finding appropriate financial backing for a project he's been developing with his daughter, who is also a game developer and has worked as an artist in games for the last eight years.</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past eight months, I've been quietly working with my daughter, Nicole, on a new game idea. She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more</em>," Schofield writes. </p>



<p>"<em>We pulled the budget down to $17 million, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of 2nd and 3rd meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10M.' Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5M.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap...I've worked on games of every size. From 2 of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So I'm back to my art. I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so thank you for playing my games</em>."</p>



<p>Schofield also added that the members of the team he and his daughter were working with to develop this early concept horror project are all looking for work, and that his daughter was also one of the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">caught up in the layoffs</a> suffered by Striking Distance Studios, the company that Schofield and others founded back in 2020. SDS also seems to have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">cancelled a project it was working on</a>.</p>



<p>The video game industry is in a tough place at the moment, no doubt about that. Schofield has been around the AAA block more than a few times now, and if this is his sign to hang it up and take early retirement, then it'll have been unfortunate for him to hang up the gloves on a final game like Callisto Protocol.</p>
