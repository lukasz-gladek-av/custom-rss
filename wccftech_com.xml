			<p>Shortly after their slew of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA also shared brief new clips for a trio of highly anticipated upcoming action games: Lost Soul Aside, Stellar Blade, and Tides of Annihilation. All of them are made by Asian developers, and they will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to guarantee exceedingly high frame rates, up to over 500 FPS in Lost Soul Aside.</p>
<p>The latter game has been in development for a long time. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered it</a> nearly seven years ago, when it was being developed for the PlayStation 4 Pro. Unlike other long-delayed games, though, there's a very good reason - it all started as a one-man project of Yang Bing before it gained a lot of attention and support. At long last, Lost Soul Aside will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 30</a> for PC and PlayStation 5, making it the first single player game published by Sony Interactive Entertainment to release day and date on the two platforms. The action title, which still runs on Unreal Engine 4, also supports ray tracing; you can find detailed system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside | Launching with DLSS 4 and Ray Tracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7qedRQM-bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Strictly in order of release, the next game is Stellar Blade from Korean developer Shift Up. This one (also published by Sony Interactive Entertainment like Lost Soul Aside) launched a year ago on the PlayStation 5 to excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a>, though developer and publisher have both since been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>As seen in the brief footage, Stellar Blade, which is also powered by Unreal Engine 4, runs at up to 371 frames per second with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;The PC release is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> at some point in June. We don't have the official system requirements yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6rVjbzIwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, we have the most recently announced game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>. This action/adventure title inspired by Arthurian myths is in development at Eclipse Glow Games with the Unreal Engine 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tentatively slated for a 2026 launch</a>. In the trailer, we see it running at up to 359 frames per second with the aid of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHuUw_UyyRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, all these trailers were captured on the new NVIDIA flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Moreover, they will have selected Performance Mode at 4K resolution to maximize frame rates. Still, even with these small caveats, they are impressive frame rate figures. We'll still have to wait to actually play the games before judging their smoothness, though, as stuttering could nonetheless mar even a high frame rate experience.</p>

			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today a new agreement with Sony to develop a prototype based on one of the PlayStation company's franchises. The game's codename is Project Delta, which really doesn't give away much.</p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called ‘work-for-hire model’., i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on commissioned by and on behalf of the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive from the Publisher an agreed remuneration.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). The detailed terms and conditions of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation of and payments for milestones are set out in an appendix to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule). The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not deviate from the provisions of the Production Agreement.</em></p>
<p>People Can Fly is far from new to this kind of collaboration. In June 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-project-possibly-in-development-at-people-can-fly-with-30-50-million-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that they had partnered with Microsoft to create a game based on one of their IPs. Given their past (they worked with Epic on the original Gears of War trilogy and even led the development of the 2013 spin-off Gears of War: Judgment), it was a safe bet that it would be another Gears title. Indeed, in late January, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game is Gears of War: E-Day, co-developed with The Coalition.</p>
<p>There's no mention of the project's budget here, though, unlike with the Microsoft collaboration. Anyway, the studio's pedigree sits squarely in the shooter genre, with games like Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/outriders-great-fun-while-it-lasts-despite-some-flaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outriders</a> in their development history. As such, PlayStation fans are already hoping that Sony has provided the green light for a new Resistance or Killzone game since Insomniac and Guerrilla Games are now busy with other work. Both sci-fi franchises have languished for over a decade despite having very interesting settings.</p>
<p>In other People Can Fly news, the Polish studio recently <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1900143444686754187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1900143444686754187%7Ctwgr%5E995914a35dfa617a5376732855cd9431d9ff1720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiplayer.it%2Fnotizie%2Fpeople-can-fly-abbandona-realta-virtuale-project-bison-sara-suo-ultimo-gioco-vr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will phase out its publishing business of Virtual Reality games, citing the lack of investments in the area even from the VR platform holders. The developer will now focus on traditional triple-A development, whether with self-publishing, work-for-hire, or co-development models.</p>
