            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Future Nintendo Switch 2 games may be able to use more of the system's resources, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Famiiboards forums member&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-closes-june-5th-12am-jst-please-read-newest-staff-post.55/post-1813878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattAgain</a>, a known developer who has worked in the game industry and has provided some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting insights in the past</a>, revealed that more console resources, such as CPU cores and RAM, are now available for developers compared to an earlier development environment. According to the user, the goal is to reduce the system resources reserved for the OS to 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM, which would allow developers to squeeze more out of the hardware in the future.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo, as usual, hasn't provided detailed information, we learned more about the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">earlier this month</a> thanks to the system SDK. As confirmed by Digital Foundry, the system currently reserves 3 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores for the OS, which will likely contribute to getting GameChat running without issues, although it's clear how the new feature could be rather demanding, as the system's SDK allows developers to test their games as if the feature is running without having an active session.</p>
<p>Even without all the system resources available for games, some Nintendo Switch 2 games are already showing that the system can run demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> well. The open-world RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, which will launch together with the system early next month, has already proven with pre-release footage how Nintendo's next-generation console can deliver a better experience than previous-generation systems and some of the most popular handheld systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements to the game where possible, including some PC-specific improvements.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on the game's official website, director Yuya Tokuda provided an update on the ongoing game stability improvements the team is researching and implementing, confirming that enhanced texture streaming is planned for future game updates. Texture streaming is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">probable causes</a> of the game's unstable performance on PC, so the team looking to improve the problem is definitely good news.</p>
<p>In the new message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also revealed additional details on the Street Fighter 6 special collaboration, which will effectively add Akuma as a playable character via a full armor set and layered armor, tempered (8★) Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad, balance adjustments, quality of life improvements, a layered weapons system and more coming with tomorrow's 1.011 update and other changes coming with Title Update 2, such as improved Seikret usability and more. You can find all the details <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/">here.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about one of the finest entries in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch.1199259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NWeedle/status/1926682916760793582?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish insider Nash Weedle</a>, Neowiz's highly successful Soulslike game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> is headed to the Nintendo Switch 2. Here's what they wrote on X:</p>
<p><em>I can confirm that a port of Lies of P for SWITCH 2 is in the works. Its announcement could be made in June, but it depends on “some factors” of the port's development, as they want to show it with a release date. Following the latest information about the Lies of P DLC, I started to pull the thread and was able to confirm with a contact that the port is in development for Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, Double A-studios had not received the development kit, but this is not true.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, it would not be surprising at all if Neowiz were indeed porting the game. Third-party developers and publishers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flocking to the new Nintendo console</a>, and it's not like it's very heavy in terms of performance requirements, anyway - on PC, it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-pc-requirements-rx6700-rtx2060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run</a> on far weaker hardware than what's in the Switch 2:</p>
<p><em>Processor: AMD Ryzen 3 1200／Intel Core i5-7500</em></p>
<p><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></p>
<p><em>Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560 4GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 4GB</em></p>
<p>Now the question is rather whether the port will launch alongside the Lies of P DLC, Overture, which still has no release date but should be available relatively soon. Our Kai Tatsumoto recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-hands-on-preview-krats-winter-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> Overture at a press event:</p>
<p><em>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</em></p>

<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST&nbsp;I&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;II HD-2D&nbsp;Remake  | Teaser&nbsp;Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDtWQZNL5MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a massive success for Square Enix, earning the praise of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated 8.6 out of 10 by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through the other Remakes next year.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/davy-x-jones-is-an-intriguing-fps-from-the-makers-of-blacktail/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish developer PARASIGHT, maker of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blacktail-intriguing-slavic-witchcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLACKTAIL</a>, has announced a new and intriguing first-person shooter game titled DAVY x JONES.</p>
<p>As you might easily guess from the title, the protagonist is the infamous pirate of legend. In this game, though, he's been betrayed, robbed, and even beheaded. But that's not the end for him, who falls into The Locker, a surreal pirate hell, and allies with his own skull - a guide and a source of endless jokes - to get revenge on the one who wronged him, none other than Blackbeard.</p>
<p>Bartosz Kaproń, CEO and Creative Director of PARASIGHT, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We're beyond excited to finally unleash DAVY x JONES upon the world. At PARASIGHT, we believe great stories should hit as hard as the action—and in DAVY x JONES, they literally do. We split our protagonist in two—his skull and his body—and threw them into the pirate underworld to fight their way back to legend. It’s our wildest journey yet, packed with surreal adventure, larger-than-life characters, and just enough surprise to keep things fun. If you've ever dreamed of swashbuckling through the afterlife with your own severed head cracking wise beside you—this is your game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Davy x Jones: Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFXyTRgrRi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Locker is split into nine islands drifting across an endless sea of clouds. In these unique environments, players will face twisted fiends, cursed souls, and legendary behemoths like the Kraken — guardians of the underworld’s darkest secrets.</p>
<p>However, another behemoth, the whale-ship hybrid Abby, befriends the protagonist and becomes his mobile base. Players can even recruit legendary officers to crew her and unleash her cannons in combat. Fights will mix swordfighting, gun action, and a grappling hook to get close.</p>
<p>Moreover, enemy drops provide an element of risk versus reward. Each defeated enemy drops Underworld Essence, and when Essences converge, they merge into a treasure chest containing powerful loot. However, each chest also unleashes an unpredictable fiend, so it's up to the player to decide whether to take that risk.</p>
<p>There's no release window yet, but DAVY x JONES will be launched for PC (there's already a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611170/DAVY_x_JONES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page)</a> and consoles.</p>
