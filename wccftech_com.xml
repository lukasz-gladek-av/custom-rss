			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>

			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the Great🖕) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>— Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>

			<p>Techland has <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1972959300436865280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a major hotfix patch for Dying Light: The Beast, updating the game to version 1.2.3. The update improves a performance issue related to stuttering when NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (or Multi Frame Generation), which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-shows-an-aging-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in my technical analysis of the game</a> as very annoying during gameplay. </p>



<p>The other highlight is that the Polish studio has recognized the absolutely overpowered grabbing ability of zombie Biters and balanced it so that it is less frustrating. That's also something I noticed right away when playing and indeed, the PC community <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-five-pc-mods-to-improve-your-dying-light-the-beast-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already provided fixes through mods</a>. Even though this is now fixed in the base Dying Light: The Beast, other mods are still worth downloading.</p>



<p>Here's the full changelog for Dying Light: The Beast 1.2.3:</p>



<p><strong><em>Stability &amp; Performance</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed various crashes to improve overall game stability.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where sharpening was not applied correctly while using DLSS.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed occasional stuttering when playing with Frame Generation enabled.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed graphical glitches when using HDR on PlayStation 5.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Gameplay Improvements</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grabbing Biters is now less frustrating and feels more fair.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where patrolling routes of Screamers in Dark Zones were broken.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Quests &amp; Progression</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tutorial:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a critical issue where, if a player received a modded weapon from someone who had already completed the tutorial, the game attempted to apply the mod a second time, thus blocking the progress.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>The Mine (Co-op):</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where destructible doors could remain indestructible for one player, blocking quest progression.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Safe Spots:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a bug where breakable doors and windows respawned after reloading, trapping players inside.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Mental Asylum Safe Spot: Fixed an issue where reloading the save could leave the entrance blocked by an unintended obstacle, preventing players from entering.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where music could loop infinitely after reloading certain quests.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>UI &amp; Consoles</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed the missing “Join the Community” button on consoles.</em></li>
</ul>
