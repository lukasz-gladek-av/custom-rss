			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally here, and to help you put your best foot forward when jumping into multiplayer matches, I've put together a guide for the best weapons and loadouts for each of its classic four classes.</p>



<p>Of course, not every weapon and variant in this guide will be available to you the moment you load up the game; you'll have to grind some levels for them, but they still work well as loadouts to work towards well before you reach the level cap.</p>



<p>Also, since this guide is meant to focus on early loadouts, when it comes to secondary weapons for each loadout, the only option until you at least reach level 24 will be the P18 pistol. It's not bad, but the actual next-best option is arguably the M45A1, and you won't get that until you reach level 39. So that's why each loadout will feature the P18 for now.</p>



<p>A final note, this guide will stick with weapons that are the signature category of weapons for each class. Of course, you're free to mix and match, but this guide is for anyone wanting to stick within that class's signature traits.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class">Battlefield 6 Guide - Best Early Weapons and Loadouts for Each Class</h2>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Assault loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For Assault players, you'll start out having to use the M433 assault rifle, which honestly isn't a bad place to start. The same goes for the introductory carbine, the M4A1. Both weapons are better for close-range encounters than what I actually recommend for this class, but Battlefield isn't just about fighting in tight corridors. That's why my actual recommendation is the B36A4 assault rifle. It has a lower rate of fire but is better for mid to long-range engagements, and packs just as much of a damage punch.</p>



<p>To make it even better for longer ranges, adding the 2.00x sight will help you see across the larger maps like Liberation Peak and Mirak Valley.</p>



<p>If you want an alternative for closer-range encounters while playing Assault, then stick with the M433, but adding a side 1.00 sight to the B36A4 once you've reached Mastery 6 can help make it more usable in close encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you'll want to take advantage of the Assault classes trait that lets you add a second primary weapon to your loadout. This is where you'll equip the M87A1 shotgun. It's the first shotgun available to you in the game, and having it in one of your gadget slots (whichever is easier for you to swap to on your button layout) is arguably far better than swapping to the P18 if you're running out of ammo in an encounter. Yes, it's really only great for mid to close range encounters, but you'll do more damage per shot than taking the time to reload your assault rifle. </p>



<p>Your other gadget should be set to the M320A1 high-explosive launcher, and for a better ease of use, mounting it to your assault rifle makes swapping to it much faster.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Assault loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: B36A4 Assault Rifle (2.00 sight, mounted launcher)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: M87A1 Shotgun</li>



<li>Gadget 2: M320A1 High Explosive Launcher</li>



<li>Throwable: Frag Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Engineer loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Engineers are arguably one of the most versatile and important classes in Battlefield 6, because they can be a direct response in large-scale battles like Conquest and Breakthrough, and are extremely useful in close-range battles with SMGs as their signature weapons.</p>



<p>The SGX is honestly a really great starting weapon for this class, but you'll want to work your way to the PW5A3 SMG, specifically its Warfighter variant, for a faster reload speed that can make or break close-quarters fights. The PW5A3 is also more versatile for mid-range battles, and since you'll want to be using the Engineer class to take out tanks and other vehicles in those large-scale fights, having a bit more range on your weapon doesn't hurt.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you start out with the MBT-LAW auto-guided launcher, which is by no means a slouch. It's great for doing solid damage to vehicles, particularly tanks, but the time you'll need to ensure you're locked on to a tank can sometimes be what gets you killed before firing. That's why you'll want to work your way up to the RPG-7V2 for a much more versatile and all-around launcher that can do solid damage to vehicles, and blow holes out the side of a building if you need to deal with some enemies behind cover.</p>



<p>Your second gadget can stay as the AV mine, or anti-vehicle mine. It's a great defensive tactic when playing defence on modes like Breakthrough, and deals heavy damage to tanks and ground vehicles.</p>



<p>Here's  a full breakdown of what your Engineer loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: PW5A3 (Warfighter variant, Fast Mag, Double-Port Brake Muzzle, Extended Barrel, Red Laser)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: RPG-7V2</li>



<li>Gadget 2: AV Mine</li>



<li>Throwable: Anti-Vehicle Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Support loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how Engineers are vital to dealing with vehicles, the Support class is vital for keeping your squad alive. Battlefield 6, like other Battlefield games before it, is at its best when you're working together with your squad.</p>



<p>That's why, before we even get to your primary weapon, one of your gadgets that should just be permanently equipped is the Defibrillator. It can damage other players, and revives your own teammates much faster than any other class. Regarding your second gadget, I recommend the GPDIS, the grenade intercept system, since it can be a better deterrent for keeping your squadmates alive under heavy fire than deployable cover.</p>



<p>Onto your primary weapon, you'll want to work towards the RPKM LMG (Carnivore variant). You'll start out with the L110, which again, isn't bad, but LMGs like it take far too long to reload for my tastes. Even though you won't have a sprinting or aiming down-sight penalty when using them with the Support class, the RPKM is the way to go in your early hours because it does more damage and is much faster to reload, making it a more versatile choice.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Support loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: RPKM LMG (Carnivore Variant)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Defibrillator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: GPDIS</li>



<li>Throwable: Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Sledgehammer </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Recon loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the Recon class. For Battlefield 6 players who want to remain on the edges of the fight and take out unsuspecting enemies from range, there are two ways you can approach this class. Either stick with a sniper rifle, though your only option then is M2010 ESR, or swap that for a DRM to fire off shots faster while still being able to see far down range with a stronger scope.</p>



<p>Now, since I said at the top of this guide that I'll be sticking with signature weapons, what I'll recommend here is the M2010 ESR, but I just wanted to note that going with a DRM can make your Recon loadout better suited for smaller-scale battles, if you wanted to go that route.</p>



<p>Regarding the M2010 ESR, it's not going to be the best when you first jump in with it, but what can make all the difference with this sniper rifle are the attachments. For example, if you're setting up in a singular spot to pick off headshots, then equipping the Bipod for your underbarrel attachment helps to keep your aim smooth. If you're going to be picking up and moving, then having the full-angled underbarrel attachment decreases your ADS time and keeps you more mobile.</p>



<p>For your gadgets, you'll want to have your Laser Designator equipped so you can help pick out vehicles and tanks for Engineers and other vehicles to lock onto. You can also pick out locations for players to focus on. Overall, it helps you and your squad see the battlefield better, which is what makes it the preferred choice.</p>



<p>Your second gadget should be the Recon Drone, since it once again helps you and your squad see the battlefield better and spot enemies for you, with the added bonus that you can use it on offence, taking out enemy gadgets through walls.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Recon loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: M2010 ESR Sniper Rifle (Bipod/Full Angled underbarrel, 6.00 scope, Range Finder right accessory)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Laser Designator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: Recon Drone</li>



<li>Throwable: Proximity Detector</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Obviously, your mileage may vary with each of these loadouts, since everyone will have their own preferences. But these are all great options for what's available to you early on in the game, well before you move through the level cap and all the challenges that are required to unlock the full arsenal. </p>



<p>I'll also put together a refreshed version of this guide when we're deeper into the game and looking at a wider range of what's available, but for now, aiming for these loadouts will help you dominate each match.</p>
