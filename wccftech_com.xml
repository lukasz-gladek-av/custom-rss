			<p>At the end of June, amid a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">myriad of rumors</a> already circling about an incoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the actor who played Edward Kenway, Matt Ryan, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/">practically confirmed</a> that the remake was real and that it was coming soon. Ubisoft took notice and, according to Ryan, wasn't too pleased with his apparent slip-up and threatened the actor with a lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ryan admitted to the legal threat while signing the box of a fan's Edward Kenway figure at a recent convention. First posted to TikTok by kylo_hd659, and then shared on <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618">Twitter by TheHiddenOneAC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">Insider-Gaming</a>), Ryan is asked by the fan about his comments and about the upcoming remaster, to which he first responds by shrugging and saying, "<em>Don't know</em>."</p>



<p>The fan presses him further, and Ryan explains, "<em>Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this *gestures to person filming,* and I was being very free and open. But I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone, and then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didnâ€™t realize he was being recordedðŸ˜µ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>â€” The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that, as Ryan explained, he wasn't aware he was being filmed at the time. Sure, you can argue that he shouldn't have said anything if he didn't want the trouble from Ubisoft, but there's also an argument to be made that Ubisoft is being a bit overly litigious here. </p>



<p>Ubisoft's own co-founder and chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">confirmed in June 2024</a> that there were remakes of Assassin's Creed games coming. Anyone who knows anything about the Assassin's Creed franchise knows that Ubisoft and its decision-making executives would be dumber than they already seem to be at times, if they weren't working on a remake of Black Flag. Ubisoft has also been in dire need of some good press around its projects and what it has coming down the pipeline. </p>



<p>It honestly seems like a waste of a day for Ubisoft's lawyers to write up the legal threat in the first place. Surely they had better things to do with their time, and a simple message from someone on Ubisoft's team who works directly with actors like Ryan, telling him to stop talking about the remake and referencing it, would have sufficed. </p>



<p>But then again, we can't exactly be too surprised about a video game company being overly litigious, nor can we be surprised about a mismanagement of time and resources at Ubisoft.</p>

			<p>Bloober Team's 2021 psychological horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> is being adapted into a film by Gary Dauberman, the man who horror fans will recognize as the writer and producer of the recent <em>It</em> and <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>



<p>Dauberman won't be writing on the project himself, as he is currently in the process of looking for a writer and director to helm the film. Dauberman's production company, Coin Operated, which he runs along with the company's president, Mia Maniscalco, will be producing the film.</p>



<p>Dauberman told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, who first reported the news of the adaptation, that "<em>With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, </em><em>The Medium</em> is a natural for a feature film adaptation. When I talked to Piotr [Babieno] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed. I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and Iâ€™m excited to be working alongside them."</p>



<p>For Bloober Team's part, chief executive officer Piotr Babieno added, "<em>Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with </em><em>The Medium</em>, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us. From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this film. Dauberman most recently worked on the adaptation of Until Dawn, which, by most accounts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/">did not impress audiences</a>. Whoever he gets to work on this adaptation as a writer and director will, of course, likely be the make-or-break element of this film.</p>



<p>The other interesting aspect about this adaptation news is that it brings into question what's happening with the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-the-medium-tv-series-the-witcher-producer/">TV series adaptation</a> of The Medium. The assumption, now that this film adaptation has been announced, is that nothing is happening with that series, and that it's another of dozens of projects that are born and die before they ever get close to audiences in the regular Hollywood churn. </p>



<p>Or perhaps we'll see the TV series be born again after this film with a different angle. Or maybe we'll see neither, as this film adaptation could see the same end the TV series did.</p>
