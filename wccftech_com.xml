			<p>Less than three months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">state of Louisiana announced it would be filing a lawsuit</a> against Roblox, which claimed that the company "<em></em><em>permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana</em>," the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Petition_0.pdf">filed his own lawsuit</a> against Roblox with similar allegations and similarly intense language, as Paxton alleges the company put "<em>pixel pedophiles and profits over</em> <em>the safety of Texas children</em>."</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-texas">press release</a> regarding the lawsuit, Paxton says, "<em>We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed. Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law</em>."</p>



<p>It's intense language, to say the least, and while Roblox Corporation would disagree with it and, in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-must-do-more-to-protect-kids-from-sick-and-twisted-freaks-texas-attorney-general-says-as-he-sues-roblox-for-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-ahead-of-kids/">PC Gamer</a>, said Paxton's claims and lawsuit were "<em>based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims</em>," there is no denying that Roblox has garnered a reputation for being a platform riddled with safety concerns for children.</p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">multiple reports</a> in recent years that have deeply investigated Roblox for its lack of child safety protocols. In 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg reported</a> that in 2023, there were 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform, with Roblox employees quoted in the report saying the company was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in the fight against child predators on the platform.  </p>

<p>People Make Games published two in-depth videos that explored issues of child predators on the platform and the issues of Roblox's dependence on user-created content and how little those creators actually see compared to the profits that Roblox Corporation rakes in.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Roblox has <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/tech-talks-update-on-roblox-safety-initiatives">made several changes since both the above videos were published</a>, but there is a case to be made that those <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">changes were implemented too late</a>, and it's also worth asking if the changes are actually doing enough to make it a safe platform for children.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that Louisiana and Texas aren't the only states in the US going after Roblox. <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/2025.10.06%20-%20%5bFINAL%5d%20KY%20Roblox%20Complaint.pdf">Kentucky has a similar lawsuit filed</a> against the company, and <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937">Florida has launched a criminal investigation</a> into Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox, for its part, as stated earlier, calls the Texas attorney general's claims "<em>sensationalized</em>," and goes further to say that it is "<em>deeply committed to child safety</em>." </p>
