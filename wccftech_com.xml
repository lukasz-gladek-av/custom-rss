			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 now available for download introduces noticeable visual improvements at the cost of a relatively minor performance impact.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the Enhanced Lumen mod available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/71?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a> is a modified engine configuration file that adds the r.Lumen.TraceMeshSDFs parameter, which helps achieve more accurate lighting and reflections calculations. Activating this parameter results in a performance loss of between 2 and 4 frames per second, but it can significantly enhance lighting in certain scenarios, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below.</p>

<p>Despite launching shortly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">mother of all shadowdrops</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became quite successful in a few short days. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that the role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive has already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies</a>, which is a fantastic result considering the game is also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles. The game's success, which is entirely deserved, as it is among one of the best role-playing games released in recent times thanks to its excellent story, cast of characters, and gameplay, also means that we will see more of its world in some form, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-chances-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33-getting-dlc-are-good-hints-lead-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested by the game's lead writer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S may soon receive a price increase, judging from what a big European retailer did just as the new month began.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, French retailer Micromania has increased the price of both Microsoft's current-generation systems overnight. All the SKUs available from the retailer have seen a €50 price increase, and the timing suggests that this price adjustment could have been made ahead of an official announcement coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The current economic situation worldwide is making it difficult for console manufacturers to maintain steady prices for their systems, so seeing an official price increase for the Xbox Series X wouldn't be surprising, however unfortunate it is.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last month</a>, Sony increased the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand due to the challenging economic environment, high inflation, and fluctuating exchange rates.</span> The system's price has been unchanged in the United States to date.</p>
<p>If the economic situation continues to be as challenging as it is today, gaming will definitely get more and more expensive down the line. While it is not a real price increase like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 increases, the Nintendo Switch 2's launch price, which may <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">increase in the future</a>, was higher than most analysts predicted, suggesting that next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft will likely be priced much higher than most expect, though <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">handheld</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">offerings</a> could mitigate this issue.</p>

			<p>HLX, the project thought to be Half-Life 3, is being widely playtested ahead of a possible summer reveal and winter release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent livestream, Tyler McVicker, who proved to be reliable regarding Valve leaks and rumors in the past, commented on the current state of the HLX project which has recently been referenced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-release-optimization/">updates for other games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2</a>, saying that it is being playtested so religiously and so widely that multiple people are willing to talk about it openly. As such, details on the game's plot are already circulating.</p>
<p>Commenting on what type of game the Half-Life 3 HLX project will be, Tyler McVicker confirmed it won't be a VR game like Alyx, and its procedural generation features won't have anything to do with terrain generation or other roguelike mechanics. These features will essentially be the next step for a system like the one powering the Left 4 Dead Director, which will influence features like doors, physics, props, enemy types, and NPCs.</p>
<p>While no official announcement has been made, things seem to be looking up for Half-Life 3, according to the leaker. The HLX project has moved along more than other similar projects, and it's currently playable from beginning to end, content or, at the very least, mechanics are probably locked at this point, and the development team is focused on optimization and polishing. As such, the leaker believes the game could finally be revealed this summer for a winter release.</p>

<p>Even if the HLX project is not Half-Life 3, another entry in the series would be quite welcome, considering Half-Life Alyx is over 5 years old, and fans of the series had to make do with other series' projects like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>. Thankfully, it may take too long to learn if the beloved series by Valve is indeed making a comeback soon.</p>
