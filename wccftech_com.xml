			<p>For fans of sports games and racing games, there are a few titles they can expect to see each year. EA and 2K will always give sports game fans and racing game fans something to play. But for 2026, thankfully there's a bit more to look forward to than just your regular annualized titles.</p>



<p>It's an especially good year for racing fans, who have the return of a major franchise to look forward to, and a new high-speed, sci-fi racer that could very well surprise everyone to be one of the best arcade racing games to come around in a while.</p>



<p>If the following games meet their expectations, you might see them again when we do our 'Best of 2026' picks at the end of the year. For now, these are the sports and racing games we're most anticipating in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/">DLC/Expansion</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Action Games</a></em></strong>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/"> <em><strong>Shooters</strong></em></a>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Horror</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Forza Horizon 6 (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forza-Horizon-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 6. Image credit: Playground Games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 may not have been the surprise reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Xbox wanted it to be at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">due to it leaking</a> about a month ahead of the show, but it was still exciting to see nonetheless. Forza Horizon 5 is arguably one of the biggest racing games released in the past decade, and its follow-up looks set to surpass its predecessor in every way.</p>



<p>We still don't know a lot about it, nor do we know when in 2026 it'll aim to be out, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">recent reports point to it being an early 2026 release</a>. Hopefully, those reports are correct, and we'll be able to head to Japan in Forza Horizon 6 sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-tennis-fever-february-12-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Tennis Fever (February 12, 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mario-Tennis-Fever.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Tennis Fever. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mario's line of sports games can be hit and miss (pun intended). Sometimes, they're excellently crafted and amazingly replayable, particularly with a few friends huddled around one TV. Super Mario Strikers on Nintendo Wii comes to mind when I think of some Mario sports games that were way more fun than they had any right to be.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Aces, the last game in the Mario Tennis series, does not fall in the same category as Strikers, but Mario Tennis Fever, the next game in the series <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">due out on February 12, 2026, on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, just might. At least we can hope it will, since Mario is due for a fun arcade-y sports game.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars: Galactic Racer (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer.png"></a><figcaption><em>Star Wars Galactic Racer. Image credit: Fuse Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Now this is pod racing,' is what every Star Wars fan watching<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/"> The Game Awards 2025 said to themselves when we all collectively realized a new Star Wars racing game was coming our way</a>. At least it would have been, if there were vehicles in the trailer that actually looked like pod racers. </p>



<p>But even a bit of confusion over the lack of the death traps that Little Ani used to win himself out of slavery can't stop the excitement buzzing around the fact that Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a new racing game from Fuse Games, a studio formed by former Need for Speed and Burnout developers. It's frankly the kind of match-made-in-heaven that is equivalent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Star Wars: Galactic Racer is able to make a case for itself this year, and that when we talk about the best racing games of 2026 at the end of the year, Forza Horizon 6 has some company in the conversation.</p>



<h2 id="h-exo-rally-championship-tbc-2026-pc">Exo Rally Championship (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Exo-Rally-Fest.png"></a><figcaption><em>Exo Rally Championship. Image credit: Exbleative</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exo Rally Championship was one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">honourable mentions for our most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025</a>, and a year later, not only are we still looking forward to it, but we've moved it up to one of our main five picks for the year. It might not have the brand recognition of the other sci-fi racers on this list, but this off-road arcade racer from developer Exbleative and publisher Future Friends Games is absolutely worth keeping on your radar.</p>



<p>There's no definitive sign as to when it'll arrive, but hopefully last year's Steam Next Fest demo was an indication that the team is making enough progress that it'll be out before the end of 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-golf-with-your-friends-2-tbc-2026-pc">Golf With Your Friends 2 (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Golf-With-Your-Friends-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Radical Forge</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ending our main picks with something fairly different from the rest, Golf With Your Friends 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Golf With Your Friends, a chaotic multiplayer golf game that arrived all the way back in 2016. </p>



<p>In the last decade, Golf With Your Friends has steadily maintained its popularity in such a way that it's sequel could become one of the year's flash-in-the-pan multiplayer games that breaks through and rides the waves of content creators playing it with their friends on livestreams. It might not reach the heights of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a>, but it certainly feels like it has that kind of potential. </p>


<div id="democracy-1512" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1512,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Most Anticipated Sports and Racing Games of 2026</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>We can't include everything in our main picks, but these games still deserve your attention. </p>

			<p>Steam's Winter Sale is now over, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most">the latest report from Alinea Analytics,</a> PC players are going to be spending their time playing ARC Raiders while they wait for the next store-wide sale for the platform this Spring.</p>



<p>December 2025 was the best December for Steam yet, with the platform generating<strong> over $1.6 billion</strong> last month. It was a <strong>22.7% increase</strong> compared to December 2024, and it handily beat December 2020's COVID-era numbers when Steam brought in a gross revenue of $1.4 billion.</p>



<p>As for what drove that record-breaking gross revenue? ARC Raiders, the third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios that continues to be the 'game of the hour' after its massive launch in October 2025, was a big part of that success. Since it hit the market, it has barely slowed down, just recently having reached over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">12 million copies sold</a></strong> overall. On Steam alone, Alinea estimates it has sold over <strong>7 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the holidays, ARC Raiders was the second-best-selling game on Steam by revenue. It sold over 250K copies on Boxing Day, and its concurrent player counts show no sign of the game leaving the top-played games on Steam anytime soon. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">it has yet to fall below 250K concurrent players on Steam since it launched</a>. </p>



<p>As for which game took the number one spot in terms of revenue, that went to Counter-Strike, which is what you'd expect from the game that constantly remains the most played game on the platform.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Steam-Top-Games-by-Copies-Sold-December-2025.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The charts for Steam's December 2025 get more interesting when you look at copies sold, as they directly point out the value of a good deal. Detroit: Become Human was 90% off during the Winter Sale, making it less than the price of a latte at Starbucks. At that price, approximately <strong>993K</strong> players who hadn't bought it before took their chance, and it was the second-best-selling game, behind ARC Raiders, for December 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Battlefield 6, which was 30% off during the Winter Sale, and Slay the Spire, which was also at an all-time low at 90% off during the Winter Sale. Good timing for developer Mega Crit, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">getting prepared to launch Slay the Spire II later this year, in March 2026</a>. </p>



<p>When ARC Raiders arrived in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto gave it a 9/10 in his review,</a> writing, "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Things Are a Bit Established at the Top” – The Top-5 Played Games in the US in 2025 on PS and Xbox Were the Same as 2024’s]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/</link>
            <guid>1398742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you think the problem with video games these days is that everyone plays the same five games all the time, which makes publishers more wary of taking risks, and instead of getting new, creative and innovative games, we get more of the same, then <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> just gave you some fuel for that argument, as the numbers for the top-five played games in 2025 on PlayStation and on Xbox were the same as the top-five games played on both platforms in 2024.</p>



<p>They're even almost in the exact same order, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">Piscatella reports on Bluesky</a>, with the top five played games in the US on PlayStation, as ranked by percentage of active players, are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Roblox</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>
</ol>



<p>On Xbox, the list is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>All five games are on the list for the most-played games on either platform in 2024, with the PlayStation 2024 list not changing at all, and the only difference on the Xbox 2024 list being that Call of Duty and Fortnite swap places, as do Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V. But it's still the same five games, seemingly consuming everyone's time on consoles in the United States.</p>







<p>Piscatella followed the news up by saying, "<em>Things are a bit...established...at the top</em>." He also claimed that a more detailed report, including the top-selling games in 2025 in the US, overall and by platform, will arrive on January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>Any new game's biggest competitor is Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Roblox. Those are <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">the five games that are dominating the industry,</a> and the reason why new games have a tough time gaining any traction.</p>



<p>Those are also five free-to-play games (Call of Duty: Warzone), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">as Piscatella has reported before,</a> US consumers are likely to spend less on video games as tariffs and the rising cost of living continue to impact their discretionary spending. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">2025 might've been the year of indies</a> controlling the conversation and the awards, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, Blue Prince, etc, but those are not the games that keep the industry moving. </p>



<p>So if you're the person complaining that we keep getting the same kinds of games over and over again, or that publishers aren't greenlighting new titles for fear that they'll get swallowed up by 'the big five,' then vote with your wallet where you can, and maybe spend a little more time <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">in the 'indies' section of Steam</a> instead of on Fortnite. It won't be much, but at an individual level, it's one of the best things you can do.</p>
