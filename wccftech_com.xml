			<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">Game Developer</a>, 2K studio Firaxis Games has suffered layoffs, and while 2K wouldn't say exactly how many developers were impacted, sources Game Developer spoke to indicated that "<em>dozens</em>" of employees were affected.</p>



<p>2K cites the layoffs as an effort to "<em>restructure and optimize</em>" the studio for "<em>adaptability, collaboration, and creativity.</em>" One of the impacted developers, Emma Kidwell, is an award-winning writer who wrote for leaders on Civilization VII and Marvel's Midnight Suns characters Deadpool and Storm. In her LinkedIn post about being impacted, Kidwell wrote that she is "<em>an incredibly adaptable writer</em>."</p>

<p>Firaxis is the latest Take-Two studio to be impacted by layoffs, as Cloud Chamber, the studio currently working on the next BioShock game, cut <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">80 developers last month</a> as part of a major restructuring to help get BioShock 4 back on track after being in development limbo for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New EA Sports College Basketball Game Is No More as EA Loses Out To 2K]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-no-more-ea-loses-to-2k-sports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ea-sports-college-basketball-game-is-no-more-as-ea-loses-out-to-2k.1288995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past June, EA teased that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">it would be bringing back its series of College Basketball games</a>, nearly two decades since the last NCAA basketball game. Now, as first reported by <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/">Insider-Gaming</a>), EA Sports College Basketball is no more, with the schools EA was in talks with choosing to take a deal with 2K Sports to be included in its NBA 2K games, and EA rescinding its offer.</p>



<p>With the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">EA's College Football games,</a> it wasn't a surprise that the company would try to expand that to other sports, especially since it already had a history of NCAA basketball games. It also isn't a surprise that other major publishers, like Take-Two and its subsidiary 2K, weren't blind to the success EA was seeing and would try to move in on collegiate sports-based games in its own way.</p>



<p>In a memo from EA Sports' vice president of commercial partnerships and licensing, Sean O'Brien, obtained by Extra Points, O'Brien confirms that EA is pulling out of its talks with the US colleges and universities that would have participated in an EA Sports College Basketball game.</p>



<p>"<em>Given there are some schools choosing to accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in NBA 2K, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded,</em>" the memo reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone at EA Sports is disappointed that we all couldn't find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a standalone college basketball game with an all men's and women's Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want. We really appreciate your support. Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season. Thanks, Sean O'Brien."</em></p>



<p>It's unfortunate news for fans of EA's NCAA games, but just like in sports, EA can't win them all. O'Brien's comment on football season instead of basketball season also doesn't seem misplaced, as EA can at least hold on to the fact that its College Football games continue to sell well.</p>
