			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares announced that its next project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sinking City 2</a>, is being moved to the first half of 2026. The first and most tragic reason is the continued assault on Ukraine by the Russian Federation, with the developers having to deal with power loss on top of the constant worry for their own safety. Sergiy Oganesyan, Head of Publishing at Frogwares, stated:</p>



<p><em>Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to. At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time. </em></p>

<p>The development of The Sinking City 2 is also going slower because Frogwares is shifting the sequel's genre from the first installment's action/adventure to survival horror. Lead Game Designer Alexander Gresko explained:</p>



<p><em>Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation adventures for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.</em></p>



<p>The studio has committed to sharing more gameplay and information in the coming months. Meanwhile, you can always check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our previous interview with the developers</a>, in which Frogwares talked about switching to Unreal Engine 5 and placing a much bigger emphasis on combat in The Sinking City 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze Entertainment is passing the torch of maintaining Payday 2 onto Sidetrack Games, so that Starbreeze can focus more on Payday 3. Sidetrack Games will take over future updates for Payday 2, including fixing any bugs that may come along, adding quality-of-life updates, and just overall keeping the game running and live for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>"<em>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the Payday modding community</em>," Starbreeze writes in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/553504715299620867">announcement on the Payday 2 Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Their work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/RAID_World_War_II/">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. They know the Payday 2 engine inside and out, and they've already gotten started</em>. <em>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23, and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows Starbreeze to maintain full focus on Payday 3, while Payday 2 continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've partnered with Sidetrack Games to support PD 2 on PC! They have roots in the modding community, and we have trust they'll bring the game back to life!</p><p>Starting Oct. 23 the first update will come out, and they'll be focusing on QoL updates to start: <a href="https://t.co/JjEpneo71b">https://t.co/JjEpneo71b</a> <a href="https://t.co/USU6I0lU2H">pic.twitter.com/USU6I0lU2H</a></p></div>— PAYDAY 3 (@PAYDAYGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1980620480500383832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Starbreeze also states that it'll host a live stream on Thursday, where it will delve further into the details around its collaboration with Sidetrack Games.</p>



<p>This is the latest update for Payday 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/">since the DLC subscription service</a> that Starbreeze introduced, and later had to apologize for due to Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/">also decreasing the discount on the Infamous Collection</a> for Payday 2. Basically, it made the previous avenue for acquiring all of Payday 2's DLC more expensive, to make the subscription service more appealing. Starbreeze restored the Infamous Collection discount to where it was before the subscription service was released.</p>



<p>As for where Payday 3 fits into this, it's clear that Starbreeze wants to focus its efforts on making Payday 3 more appealing for Payday fans, since many of them still haven't moved off of Payday 2. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">cancelled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based co-op game</a> in order to focus more on Payday 3, and now it has passed off maintaining Payday 2 to put more time into Payday 3.</p>



<p>However, even with the extra space to work on Payday 3, it'll still take years for it to be anything close to what Payday 2 is. The sheer quantity of DLCs available to Payday 2 players will take years to match, never mind just hitting the same quality bar as the ones players love in Payday 2. Payday 3 also, as far as we know, still won't include everything that players want from it, now that Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-no-longer-developing-payday-3-offline-mode-not-feasible-for-studio/">has confirmed it won't be working on an offline mode for the game</a>.</p>



<p>In any case, Starbreeze seems committed to making up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">the abysmal launch that Payday 3 had</a>, which was plagued by scores of technical and server connection issues, and a gross lack of content. We'll see where Payday 3 stands a year from now, and if Starbreeze has begun to make inroads in their journey to make Payday fans play Payday 3, which, two years after release, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/#1y">struggles to get more than 3K concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gaijin Entertainment, the studio behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/">War Thunder,</a> Modern Warships, Aces of Thunder, and MWT: Tank Battles, has announced EdenSpark, a new open-source platform where, along with an AI assistant, users can create games and make them accessible "<em>to console users hassle-free</em>" and "<em>truly own the code of their creations</em>."</p>



<p>The trailer frames EdenSpark as the platform that simplifies the game-making process with "<em>easy 3D modelling</em>," whatever that's supposed to mean, and that, with the help of its simplified toolset and AI assistant, you can "<em>create a game, and play it instantly on consoles</em>." </p>



<p><a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/edenspark-will-open-a-new-path-for-indie-developers-on-consoles">A blog post</a> on Gaijin Entertainment's official website speaks a little more clearly about EdenSpark, though the framing is generally the same, as EdenSpark is described as a new platform "<em>designed to lower the barriers to game development</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EdenSpark — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark gives individual game creators an easy access to consoles, even without a registered company or costly legal paperwork. Anyone will be able to turn their idea into a game and share it with friends on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox</em>," Gaijin Entertainment writes. </p>



<p>"<em>At the same time, unlike closed ecosystems offering similar experiences, EdenSpark developers will retain full ownership of their games. This means that creators can keep their projects inside EdenSpark's community or, if they wish, self-publish independently, taking their work anywhere. This combination of accessibility and freedom is unique: major engines might offer professional flexibility, but they either don't help you [bring your game] to console audience fast and easy or are not available under FOSS, or neither. EdenSpark bridges the gap</em>."</p>



<p>Essentially, it seems like EdenSpark is a platform that users will be able to create games on their PC or console, and begin playing the game they just made, something akin to MediaMolecule's Dreams. It seems to go further, though, because it's not all one stylistic look, and if you wanted to take that game and properly publish it on the PlayStation or Xbox store, you'd be able to do just that.</p>



<p>So, if all you wanted to do was make a game and have people play it on their consoles, EdenSpark purports to be able to do that. But it's unclear if users will be able to monetize their games on EdenSpark, or if they'd have to self-publish in order to make money selling the games they made with EdenSpark. It's also unclear if, even with Gaijin Entertainment repeatedly saying that users will "<em>own</em>" the code their games are built on, Gaijin Entertainment would still ask for a cut of any profits made from games created on its platform.</p>



<p>It also seems like the AI assistant is a huge part of EdenSpark achieving its goal to "<em>lower the barriers to game development</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Experienced</em> <em>programmers can dive deep into code, while complete newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts. It's even possible to create games using a retail console</em>,<em> with a keyboard being the only extra accessory you'll need</em>. <em>EdenSpark is powered by Gaijin's Dagor Engine, the proven technology powering blockbuster titles such as War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter, ensuring professional-grade performance for projects of any scale</em>."</p>



<p>At some point in November 2025, Gaijin Entertainment will host a closed beta where users in the beta can take a look at several "<em>game prototypes</em>" and play around with EdenSpark before it launches into its 1.0 version sometime in Summer 2026, according to the <a href="https://edenspark.io/en">roadmap on the platform's official website</a>. The AI assistant for EdenSpark will also only be available in its 1.0 launch.</p>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark is more than just another game creation kit,</em>" added Anton Yudintsev, Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder. "<em>It’s the first platform that truly opens consoles to solo developers, while guaranteeing they remain the owners of their games. Whether you want to share a funny prototype with friends or build a real career as an independent studio, EdenSpark gives you both the tools and the freedom.”</em></p>



<p>At this point, it's too early to say with confidence if EdenSpark will be anything of note in the games industry or not. There are already free game-making platforms that let people jump into game development with plenty of tutorials and assistance to help make it as easy as possible. EdenSpark claims to be a new level of ease-of-use, partly because you can use it on any PlayStation or Xbox console you'd grab at your local retailer, instead of having to swing for a development kit.</p>



<p>It's not a bad concept, realistically, there are just a lot of variables left unanswered, like if EdenSpark will let users monetize the games they make within the EdenSpark ecosystem, whether Gaijin Entertainment would ask for a cut of profits for games made with EdenSpark that do get self-published, and perhaps most importantly, how easy to use EdenSpark really is, and if users really could create games that hit the necessary quality bar that makes players want to pay for them. Or, if EdenSpark becomes the new home for anyone looking to make the kinds of AI-slop games we already see filling digital storefronts, only now they get churned out even faster than before.</p>
