			<p>It's GeForce NOW's 5th anniversary month, and to celebrate that milestone, there will be five major releases added to GeForce NOW. For this week, there are seven games that are being added to the service, with a total of 17 games being added to the service this month. If you want to play some of the latest major releases but don't have a game-ready rig, GeForce NOW gives you the option to be able to stream it to your own device without having to do any of the difficult work. If you are an Ultimate or Performance member, you'll be able to play Kingdom Come: Deliverance II at the highest frame rates on your devices.</p>
<p>If you're not sure about whether you want to plunge into the new historical RPG, you can read the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/">review written by Chris Wray</a>, which can help provide more information about what you'll get up to in this game and what you can expect from the performance of it.</p>
<p>This game has enhanced graphics powered by GeForce RTX, which makes it one of the better-suited games to play through GeForce NOW, even if you don't have a game-ready rig. You can play the game at 4K 120fps in an eight-hour session with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate membership</a>, or 1440p and 120fps in a six-hour session with the Performance membership, depending on what your preference is.</p>

			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 on PC and a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, among other small fixes.</p>
<p>Title Update 1.5.1, which is around 3 GB big on PC and Xbox consoles and 1.93 GB big on PlayStation 5, introduces NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on PC, allowing owners of any NVIDIA RTX graphics card to enjoy better image quality with the new Transformer model and RTX 50 series graphics card owners to boost FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Outlaws title update also brings, as mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, updating the PSSR upscaler to the latest version, which addresses some image quality issues that were very clearly noticeable in the previous version of the game. Additionally, the update fixes a few other small issues on every platform, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1O5273Z4vy6zpjNxkW4htN">official patch notes.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last year in a far from optimal state, but developer Ubisoft Massive has consistently improved the game, fixing the biggest issues and tweaking the gameplay as needed. In a previous update, the developer also removed some divisive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealth missions to </a>enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
