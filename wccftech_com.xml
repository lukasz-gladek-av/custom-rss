			<p>Amazon's upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner in <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a>, a director for its first few episodes in Shogun director <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">Frederick E.O. Toye</a>,</strong> and today, Amazon and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> announced the first confirmed member of the show's cast. <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who players will recognize as the voice of <strong>Thor</strong> from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a></strong>, will step into the role of <strong>Kratos</strong> for the upcoming show.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011529372608364835"> post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Prime Video account</a>. The post simply reads, "<em>Meet Ryan Hurst, your Kratos in the God of War series coming to Prime Video</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it's not <strong>Christopher Judge</strong> in the role, the voice actor who is now famous for his portrayal of Kratos and his ability to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H30ydojdbuc">one three-letter word with more authority than anyone has ever put behind it</a>, Ryan Hurst is still an incredible choice. The side-by-side photo shows that he at least has the beard down (save for some colouring that'll likely come once filming starts), and we know from his performance as Thor that he'll be able to step into the role of Kratos without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Now that we have our Kratos, with the show reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to begin filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, hopefully, we'll soon learn who else will be filling out the rest of the cast. As cast members and characters start to be named, we'll also learn more about the approach that Amazon is taking to this show. We know that it will be jumping into the Norse setting of the recent games, but whether it will follow the same story from the previous two games or create its own is unclear.</p>
