			<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day-one patch introduces plenty of improvements to the game, including ray tracing and performance improvements.</p>



<p>As confirmed to <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN</a>, the 1.006 patch will be live by the time the game officially launches on October 2, and it is a highly recommended download for those who are going to play the game with a retail copy, as it will introduce some critical improvements. Chief among them will be multiple improvements to environmental rendering performance, fixes for Ray Tracing Mode to ensure lighting consistency and performance, and various performance improvements in missions with high character counts.</p>



<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day one patch doesn't stop at improving just performance and stability. It is also packed with gameplay fixes, animation improvements, significant environment enhancements, and interface fixes. The full details on every improvement and fix can be found in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-details-ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-notes-includes-an-extensive-list-of-improvements"> full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>Although improvements are always welcome, Ghost of Yōtei was not in dire need of them, as the game looked and played great even without the day-one patch, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">highlighted by Alessio in his review</a>. The game's only major issue, which no patch can fix, is its extreme similarity to the first entry in the series, although it is one that is easy to look past, considering its quality.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei launches worldwide on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If its predecessor is anything to go by, the game is also expected to release on PC in the future</p>

			<p>Avalanche Studios has confirmed that the studio will suffer layoffs across each branch in Malmö, Stockholm, and Liverpool, with Liverpool closing down and its entire staff laid off. The cuts come a little less than two months after Contraband, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/">project it was working on since 2021</a> which was set to be an Xbox exclusive, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">cancelled as part of the massive cuts Microsoft made earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement posted to its official website</a>, the studio known for its Just Cause games began by saying, "<em>In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group's long-term success</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö</em> <em>and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure teams to address our games' needs. Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities</em>."</p>

<p>When Microsoft's massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">9,000+ layoff hit this past July as part of the company's increased focus and investment in its AI efforts</a>, it wasn't exactly clear if Contraband would be part of the same fallout that struck <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced new MMO</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the Contraband trailer that announced the game in 2021 <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1942272038045122595">being set to 'private' on the official Xbox YouTube channel,</a> was certainly telling. The cancellation was confirmed a little more than a month after the initial wave of Microsoft layoffs broke.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/">Avalanche Studios laid off staff while it was still developing Contraband</a>, before we knew what the game's fate would be, at least we could hope the studio would muddle through because it had a project on the go. Now with Contraband gone and an entire branch of the studio shut down, it is a much bleaker picture for Avalanche Studios future.</p>



<p>Avalanche Studios has not commented on exactly how many developers are being laid off, and how many worked at its Liverpool studio. According to its website, Avalanche currently has a team of 600 developers across the three branches.</p>
