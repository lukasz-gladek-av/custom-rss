			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>

<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>

			<p>Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked, is arriving in theatres on November 21, 2025, and there is reportedly a very good Mario-themed reason to go see it. According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">X (formerly Twitter) user My Time to Shine</a>, which has a reputation for publishing scoops within the movie world, the first proper trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be shown at screenings of Wicked: For Good.</p>



<p>"<em>The Mario Galaxy trailer will be attached to Wicked For Good meaning it will release online before November 21st</em>," My Time to Shine writes on their X (formerly Twitter) post.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">This past September</a>, we learned that the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. The Movie would be called 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' and it would be arriving in theatres on April 3, 2026. With a release date set for next Spring, it makes a lot of sense that it would have a new major trailer debut with one of the last major box office debuts left in 2025.</p>



<p>And as My Time to Shine points out, with the trailer making its way to theatres before the end of this month, that means it'll likely appear online within the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When the title and release date were revealed for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, we got a very short teaser trailer that briefly showed the Mushroom Kingdom, following a golden yellow butterfly through the kingdom and into the sky for the title reveal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever trailer we get next will likely provide our first insights into the basic plot that this sequel will follow and reveal a little more about which characters will be involved, both returning and new.</p>
