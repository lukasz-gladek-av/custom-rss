			<p>Not every game, but some games, like Tripwire Interactive's Killing Floor 3, deliver exactly what you'd expect by looking at the cover. You shoot Zeds (read: zombies), and when you're done shooting Zeds in one level, there are more Zeds for you to shoot on another. In between the shooting, you'll level up your weapons, refill on ammo and gear, and then go back to shooting Zeds. Oh, and there are also a few narrative-driven tasks to complete, but the main course is shooting Zeds.</p>



<p>That's fine, really. I love a strong narrative, but I can just as easily get behind a game where the story is nothing more than a reason for the gameplay to happen. Or at least it would be, if shooting Zeds was worth the rest of the game's failings. It's not a bad thing for a game to be streamlined against everything else, but it's bad for those games to not even get their core pitch right.</p>



<p>Which is the unfortunate case Killing Floor 3 finds itself in. It's not about much more than shooting Zeds, and the shooting, along with the Zeds and everything else, is fresh from the 'just fine' section on the shelves of video game stores.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In some ways, it's not a bad shooter. There's a solid amount of Zeds that chase after you each wave, and their heads pop with enough satisfying zeal. Zeds are also varied enough, and present an interesting enough challenge as you try to deal with the different variants that'll shoot you, charge you, and jump you from every direction. Also, it's not the only issue I have with the sound mixing, but these have to be the quietest zombies I've ever not heard the way I've been caught off guard. Maybe that's just a me problem, and I have to get my ears checked, but it's come up enough times and like I said, it's not the only problem with how the game sounds.</p>



<p>There's a good deal of weapon variety, you can run around each map half-decently, and I appreciate that in a game so focused on bodily mutilation, you can drop the firearms and flamethrowers altogether and just enter the fray with a couple of swords. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a solid mix, and can help make the gameplay feel a little more engaging than it does when you stick to more tried-and-true combos, with my preference being a classic assault rifle/shotgun loadout.</p>



<p>There's also a good amount of synergy to be found with the six currently available classes to choose from. Between weapon, build and special ability coordination, there's a lot that you can combo up between teammates with a little communication and preparation. Unsurprisingly, it's better to hop into matches with others instead of try to run through any of these maps on your own. Playing solo is an option, but it's a huge grind to get anywhere compared to playing with others.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3 boss Queen Crawler</figcaption></figure>



<p>And a grind is the only thing more plentiful than Zeds in Killing Floor 3. The amount of objectives there is to grind for is perfectly set up for new players to make Killing Floor 3 their new forever-game. Or at least that's clearly Tripwire Interactive's hope with how everything is already set up for it.</p>



<p>Not narrative objectives - there's only 10 main story-focused missions, through which Nightfall's director, Cordelia Clamely, narrates your way through as you jump back and forth between the Army Depot, R&amp;D Lab, Horzine Factory, Radar Station, Convoy, City Streets, and Offices. When they're done? </p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Head back to all those same maps, plus one more (Sewers), and kill some more Zeds and the same three 'just fine' bosses, chasing after daily and weekly challenges, along with a random new challenge each week to mix things up a bit more if you are already getting tired of the base challenge the game's only core mode offers. Hear each of the characters rattle off their one-liners, and of course, there's also a battle pass with cosmetics for your character and weapons to work through. And then ramp up the difficulty when you get bored of running through each of the maps on the default 'Normal' setting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Which, again, there's nothing inherently wrong with. I like a zone-out game as much as the next person, but Killing Floor 3 doesn't just feel like a surface-level game that you can zone out to. It feels like a game that's not totally there. That's not exactly complete, almost like the early access version of Killing Floor 3 before it's packed to the brim with DLC and actually chock-full of stuff to do and see. That's all on its way, of course. There's a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/517468222093525040"> first-year roadmap</a> already laid out, with a new specialist, new map, new Zed type to mow down, new bosses, weapons, mods, and more campaign-focused missions coming before the end of the year. In 2026, there's another map coming, more weapons, mods, a new Perk, which is what the classes are called, and then whatever is unannounced as part of the second year roadmap.</p>



<p>It all feels as hollow as the weapons unfortunately do, which is my other problem with the sound mixing and quality. Weapons don't sound satisfying on the trigger pull, and getting weapons to sound satisfying to fire is pretty much the whole game in shooters. Sure, there's a bunch of window dressing around that one aspect of the game, but how a gun sounds is the key element to how much fun it is to press the trigger. When that's lacking, practically nothing in the window dressing can make up for it.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are more weapons, maps, specialists, perks, and everything else coming, but how much is tomorrow's promise worth today? In a game like Killing Floor 3, not much, thanks to the fact that you'll run out of things to do before the day is done, and then tomorrow the new content that's promised won't be out yet.</p>



<p>It's been nearly a full decade since <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-2-review-zombie-killing-never-looked-so-good/">Killing Floor 2</a>, which has been supported with a lot of content to work through in that time. Now, after some <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">delay</a>, Killing Floor 3 has arrived, asking a full-price entry fee with nowhere near the kind of content Killing Floor 2 has. If you're brand new to the series, then it's easy to get in now on the ground floor (pun intended), but it's difficult to think that anyone who wasn't bored of Killing Floor 2 wouldn't just keep playing that instead of jumping into the third act of this trilogy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>And there's all of this before mentioning the fact that the game does not run particularly well at the moment. Tripwire Interactive is surely going to be putting out patch after patch to fix things, but its 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, with a good chunk of the 4,000+ reviews that players have left citing technical problems and a game that runs poorly, which it does, is another sign of a game released in an unfinished state.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game, but at launch, it's a shell of the game that it's promised to be, a promise made by the fact that its predecessor is filled to the brim and then some with DLC. In the meantime, what we have is a game that doesn't fulfill the one ask I have of every shooter, where you can see everything you need to see in an afternoon, and where the rest of the time you're spent running around chasing giant objective lists that boil down to busy work. It's all just fine, and even knowing that the technical issues will hopefully be the first ones to get sorted, the bar is on the floor with Killing Floor 3. With the technical issues, you could say that it's not even hitting that minimum. Come back in a year and/or when it goes on sale to see if anything has changed.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game in a lot of ways. The base pitch of killing Zeds can be fun, and when you get some friends together to properly line up different Perks, it can be a good time to pull different abilities together and get some good teamwork flowing. But there are better games you can play to accomplish all the things that Killing Floor 3 accomplishes, and with the flat sounding weapons and so little to do, on top of the early technical problems, Killing Floor 3 is not the kind of game you should run to your computer to check out at launch. Maybe in a year, though.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Killing Zeds is a good time, even better and more chaotic with friends
</li><li>There's plenty of weapons and build variety to shake things up</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It's a shell of a game with very little to do
</li><li>Guns sound hollow and aren't satisfying to shoot, even if Zeds still fall in a satisfying way
</li><li>Poor technical performance makes it a chore to run
</li><li>Progression is a grind, and an even worse one if you try to play the game solo</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once known for their experiential horror titles focused on surviving rather than fighting, Bloober Team has slowly shifted their focus into a more combat-centric survival horror experience. After the success of last year’s remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, the Polish developers recently unveiled a science fiction title they’ve been developing in tandem with The Medium. We and a small number of other journalists were recently invited out to Oakland, California, to get an early look at the first few hours of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s about writing what you know, and Bloober Team has taken that old adage to heart with Cronos: The New Dawn being set within a very familiar backdrop for the developers. Some of their earlier titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/observer-system-redux-dystopian-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Medium</a>, were also set within the country’s borders, but Cronos: The New Dawn represents a particular moment in time for the citizens. Following the aftermath of World War II and the Soviet occupation, the city of Nowa Huta was idealized in real life as a monument to the power of the Soviets and a utopian society centered around the city’s steelworks. It’s here, set many years in the future from the city’s intended groundbreaking, that Cronos: The New Dawn takes place. As one of the developers said, putting an authentic piece of the world into a horror story makes it more attractive because you can identify with it even if you’ve never been there.</p>



<p>As a Traveler, the player is tasked with venturing back into key moments of time and extracting a target before they are killed. This is done by piloting into time rifts and exploring the world with only a rough idea of where the intended survivor is. From there, the Traveler is largely on their own, taking over in the footsteps of where their predecessors might have fallen.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a lot of inspiration from the development of Silent Hill 2 in how the game flows, from the intimate camera angles to inventory management and opening locked doors. What sets this science fiction horror apart from the more psychological traumas of James Sunderland are the enemies known as Orphans. These grotesque and often indescribable masses of flesh and tentacles seek out the player with indiscriminate focus, chasing them down and even coordinating their attacks to sneak up on the player while their back is turned. Something unique that Bloober Team has introduced in Cronos: The New Dawn is the ability for these creatures to merge into one another and combine attributes from a fallen comrade, making them more deadly and more difficult to put back down. Having to deal with one Orphan that can spit acid is bad enough, but once they get reinforced armor, fighting them face to face becomes a struggle.</p>



<p>The most efficient way of dispatching these Orphans once they’re knocked down or slain is by using fire. The Traveler can use accelerants scattered around the environment, like discarded jerry oil cans or conspicuously marked barrels, to fill the area with fire. The player can also restock up to a single fuel cell (at least this early on in the story) that can be used to shoot out a small flamethrower and engulf those around in flames. As Cronos: The New Dawn doesn’t feature your traditional dodge or evasion movements, the developers showed off that this flamethrower ability is their way of giving players a way to escape from enemies or mitigate an incoming attack. While the player can only hold one unit of fuel at a time, I did make an effort to see if the game would let me store one in the Item Box that litters many save rooms; the game already knows if you have any fuel in hand, even if it’s in one of these boxes, so there isn’t a way to break the game and carry around more than intended.</p>



<p>Inside these save rooms are a number of terminals that can be used to upgrade The Traveler themselves as well as their different weapons they pick up. From your modest pistol to a stronger shotgun and others, each gun can use the currency that The Traveler picks up on their mission to upgrade the various parameters, giving weapons more damage, a faster reload speed, or also giving the player more health to stand a better chance at surviving. There’s also a crafting table in most locations and the same materials used to make bullets are also used to craft healing supplies, so players must make a conscious decision as to which would give them a better chance of surviving.</p>



<p>The gunplay in Cronos: The New Dawn is largely similar to what players saw in Silent Hill 2 or even EA’s Dead Space series. Played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, players can freely target limbs on an enemy to knock them down or aim for the head for increased damage. Out of all the weapons that I picked up during my two-hour session, the shotgun was the only one that felt like it was properly effective. The pistol was little more than a deterrent unless you were willing to unload the better part of a full magazine into a single enemy to take them out. Of course, you could just as easily try to run around some of these enemies and save your bullets, but the tight corridors of Nowa Huta’s apartment buildings don’t give The Traveler much room to run past an enemy. Once they’re downed, you can always give them a good head stomp just to be sure, but that won’t stop enemies from merging. Only fire gives players that certainty.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cronos_Hospital-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>My experience culminated in a boss fight against a writhing mass of tentacles that would form itself into a hulking black humanoid that would either chase me down and swing indiscriminately in my direction or start throwing parts of itself at me when I tried to shoot it at range. I was rather thankful that this was at the end of the demo, as I had used up all of my healing items and bullets that I brought with me and was limited to the ammo that I could scavenge from the enclosed arena to do the final bits of damage. It was a bit of a low point to the experience, not just because it took me multiple attempts before I could dispatch the boss and get to my final destination, but also at how spongy some of the enemies can be and just how many bullets they’d take to go down.</p>



<p>If you take a step off the beaten path and explore around Nowa Huta in Cronos: The New Dawn, there are multiple small side paths that often lead to lost artifacts that can be cashed in for currency or those essential few bullets or healing items necessary for survival. There are also a variety of collectibles, from your usual gamut of audio logs and written notes to comic books. Backtracking to a much earlier section of the demo with the wire cutters I picked up rewarded me with a quiet respite filled with collectible supplies and a single cat that was added to my lorebook, seemingly one of the various collectibles to scour and find throughout neofuture Krakow.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is tentatively set for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC/Mac.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-new-playstation-handheld-apus-codenames-revealed-xbox-next-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-to-have-3nm-rdna-5-%E2%80%9Cat2%E2%80%9D-gpu-die-192-bit-bus-memory-c.1254888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The codenames for the APUs that will power the PlayStation 6 and the PlayStation handheld have been revealed by prominent leakers, effectively confirming that another leaked APU from AMD will power the next-generation Xbox console.</p>



<p>Following the release of a new video providing some new information on the leaked AMD Zen 6 Magnus APU, Moore's Law Is Dead provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx5bPPRXBb7iDre4lkQXKdfzbg0mY6x77d">an update</a> on the APU codenames for next-generation systems that have been circulating online in the past few days, revealing that Orion is the codename for the APU that will power the PlayStation 6 and Canis is the codename of the APU that will power the new PlayStation handheld. While no other known leaker confirmed if Orion is indeed the APU of the next-generation console by Sony, known AMD leaker Kepler L2<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270660157"> confirmed</a> that Canis is indeed the APU of the PlayStation handheld, adding that it has a <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270662745">monolithic design.</a></p>



<p>As there were some doubts regarding the Magnus APU being the PlayStation 6 APU, now that it is known that Orion will be the system's APU, the AMD Zen 6 APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">earlier this month</a> has been confirmed to be the one that will power the next-generation Xbox. In the video mentioned above, Moore's Law is Dead revealed some additional details on the APU, which will have a 3nm RDNA "AT2" GPU die, can go up to 70 CU, but it is expected to get 68 CU yields, and it will have a 192-bit memory bus, and not a 384-bit bus as previously revealed. Looking at the leaked specs, AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-zen-6-magnus-leak-amds-massive-apu-for-next-gen-console-medusa-point-specs.1686433/post-270660139">speculates</a> Microsoft may use a split memory model again, as a 192-bit bus is considered too little to feed both CPU and GPU. </p>

<p>With the first information on the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox leaking online, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about what the two systems will be capable of. With machine learning having made its proper debut in the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaler, it will be very interesting to see what these systems will offer besides better specs than their predecessors.</p>

			<p>An ambitious The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind RTX Remix path tracing mod is in the works, and its first version is now available for download.</p>



<p>The Morro RTX mod, whose 0.1 version is now available for download from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/morro-rtx">Mod DB</a>, aims to update the entire game with new light sources, PBR materials based on the original textures, enhance model geometry, and more. The first version of the mod updates the light sources in the Imperial Prison Ship, Seyda Neen, Balmora and Vivec areas, features over 300 individual model updates and some placement adjustments. While it's clear from the video outlining the project below that there's still a lot of work to be done, it shows great promise and hopefully will provide fans of the series with a new way to enjoy the classic game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While there's no indication The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind will ever be remastered or remade entirely, there's still the chance Bethesda could decide to bring back the classic game at some point.  The <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">amazing success</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered clearly showed that fans are more than willing to re-experience the classic entries in the series with some choice improvements, so hopefully, the third entry in the series will receive the same treatment its successor got at some point, although Morrowind may need a gameplay update more than Oblivion did. You can learn more about how Virtuos updated the fourth entry in the series while leaving gameplay almost intact in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is getting performance and game balance improvements in the future, the game's developer confirmed in a new message shared today.</p>



<p>Today, developer Lenzee Games provided an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of the improvements that are coming to the Soulslike released last week, including improved framerates, optimized default settings for some graphics cards, better stability, enhanced texture quality, asset detail, and precision in low-resolution areas. The development studio is also taking a good look at the game's balance, and is aiming to correct the character's raising speed after getting knocked down, reduce damage and number of certain tramps, lower impact resustance of some low level enemies, reduce <em>"exploration pressure"</em> in some areas, improve AI logic for regular enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, no timeframe has been provided as for when these improvements will be implemented, but still, it's good to know the developer is looking to fix some of the game's critical issues.</p>



<p>It's a shame WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched with its performance issues on PC and consoles, as I have found the game to be entertaining enough, despite all of its issues.

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
