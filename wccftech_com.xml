			<p>During the Galaxies Showcase, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms published a new trailer for the Painkiller reboot. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late March at the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024 for a release scheduled later this year.</p>
<p>In the new Painkiller game, players will use these seven weapons to slay all sorts of demons and foes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrodriver: Barrage enemies with rapid-firing shurikens that bounce off hard surfaces.</li>
<li>Stakegun: Hurls high-damage stakes that can impale foes from long-range.</li>
<li>SMG: Unleashes loads of ammo in short, rapid-fire bursts.</li>
<li>Handcannon: Decimate enemies from long range with deadly precision.</li>
<li>Shotgun: Spits destructive pellets at short range that can damage and stagger multiple foes.</li>
<li>Rocket Launcher: Discharges a rocket projectile with a devastating blast radius that can stagger even heavy enemies.</li>
<li>Painkiller: a versatile weapon with a brutal melee attack that hooks onto enemies, shreds them to pieces, and refills your ammo.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this reboot, players must choose between four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. Each comes with unique perks and boosts to energy, health, power, or damage. Tarot cards can be used to enhance character abilities and even combined with those of other players. Indeed, the addition of cooperative multiplayer is arguably the greatest change compared to the original. We'll have to wait and see if the game can retain its signature gameplay even when playing with others.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Showcase, independent developer Legion Studio shared the second official trailer for Covenant, an upcoming first-person dark fantasy action game. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Covenant is being developed by a 12-person team with industry credits in big franchises like Call of Duty, DOOM, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Destiny, and Halo.</p>
<p>Players will step into the role of a warrior angel sent from the Heavens into Creation to follow in the steps of the fallen angel Malach. According to Legion, this mythical land is designed to be fully interconnected, just like in a Soulslike game. Because of this, puzzles, riddles, platforming, and exploration are going to be part of the player's journey. Discovering shortcuts and seeking out hidden paths will be the key to uncovering every secret.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is the core of the game. The developers said they have put a lot of emphasis on melee combat, which was inspired by fighting games (Tekken, Smash Bros), immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Dishonored), and action games (Dark Souls). There are even different stances that change the player character's entire fighting style, down to the way they run, jump, kick, and slide. Each of the stances drastically modifies the play style. Magic will also play a key role in complementing the build crafting, strategy, and creativity that players will be able to exhibit.</p>
<p>Covenant will support co-op multiplayer as well as competitive multiplayer in dedicated 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>

<p>The game is said to be still in early development. Legion said they'd like to avoid going into early access, but it may become necessary at some point if the studio needs financial help (they are currently seeking a publisher). They would also wish to port their game to consoles, but for now, they can only promise the PC version, which can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
