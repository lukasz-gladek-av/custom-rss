<p>This game was previously announced in 2022, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">15-minute extended gameplay video</a> being released during a State of Play in September last year. In this video, viewers were introduced to the dark world of Hell is Us, where you'd have to explore a war-torn country, going on an investigative journey to uncover the past, as well as confronting the ongoing chaos through the country.</p>
<p>This new trailer introduces viewers to the main character Rémi, who is voiced by Elias Toufexis (Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Assassin's Creed, Starfield) in the English language version of the game.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell is Us. I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character and the events that have shaped his personality," says Elias Toufexis. "The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure game where you rely on melee combat for your main method of attack, with a heavy focus on player-incentivized exploration and a captivating story. Instead of being given markers to show them the way, players are encouraged to follow their instincts. This methodology is being used as an homage and return to the roots of adventure games from the 90s, where hand-holding in video games was very minimal.</p>
<p>You play as Rémi, a protagonist who is on an investigative journey to find who he was in a country that was torn apart by civil war. Along the way, he'll find supernatural creatures that are reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments that were found in the region.</p>
<p>Along with the Standard Edition of the game, there will also be a Deluxe Edition that you can purchase, giving you some in-game goods. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell is Us</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for Rémi</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for The Drone</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Secret Code for in-game bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you pre-order the game, you will be rewarded with a Military Pack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, you'll get 72-hour early access to the title.</p>
