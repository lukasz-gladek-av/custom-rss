			<p>A new Control update has gone live today on PC, introducing a new ray tracing preset, official HDR support, NVIDIA DLSS updates, and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://controlgame.com/control-march-2025-update-notes-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.30 update</a> brings to all users content that was previously available only as a pre-order bonus, such as the Astral Dive Suit, the Tactical Response Gear, and the Urban Response Gear, as well as the Dr. Yoshimi Tokui's Guided Imagery Experience featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima, which was only available as a PS4 Digital Deluxe Edition pre-order bonus.</p>
<p>Besides making pre-order exclusive content available to all, the new Control March 2025 PC update introduces plenty of technical improvements, such as a new ultra ray tracing preset which gets the user more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability, ultrawide resolution support up to 48:9 aspect ratio, updated SDR to 10 bits to reduce visible color banding, support for resolutions higher than 4K and more. Additionally, the new update also updates NVIDIA DLSS to version 3.7 with higher temporal stability and adds DLAA and arbitrary resolutions support, among other things.</p>
<p>The Control 1.30 update also finally brings official HDR support to the game, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-patch-for-remedys-control-just-dropped-adds-fake-hdr-despite-true-hdr-being-available-via-semi-official-mod.1129878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to online reports</a>, it only caps the overall brightness value without adding additional highlight detail, so the<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-unofficial-hdr-ultrawide-patch-version-1-4-brings-hdr-and-dlss-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> unofficial implementation</a> still continues to be the way to go for those with HDR monitors.</p>
<p>Control is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/">A sequel</a> is currently in the works, alongside a spin-off multiplayer game called FBC: Firebreak, which will launch<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/"> later this year.</a></p>
