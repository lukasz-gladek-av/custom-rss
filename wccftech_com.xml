			<p>Yesterday, a fan-made standalone remake of Counter-Strike called CS: Legacy was unveiled with an announcement trailer. It's being made by a small group of developers who previously worked on CSPromod between 2008 and 2012 and have since got back together for this new project.</p>
<p>According to them, CS: Legacy will be a completely standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up with entirely custom code and game assets (textures, models, sounds, animations, UI, et cetera). The game is built on Valve's official 2013 Source Engine SDK codebase, with the developers making their own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various systems. It runs on its own advanced custom branch of Valve's official Source Engine 2013 public SDK. The aforementioned tweaks include a custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering shaders, a wholly rewritten reflection system, a fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools, and many more features.</p>
<p>The early access will include five maps: Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, Aim_map. Fans can support CS: Legacy by subscribing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CSLegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the team's Patreon</a>, which includes six tiers:</p>
