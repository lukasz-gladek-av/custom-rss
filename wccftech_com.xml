<p>It's the first limited-edition Meta Quest headset ever, and according to Lori Wright, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and development at Microsoft on their <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/">Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the headset, "<em>is part of our [Xbox's] ongoing partnership and celebrates the expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) on Meta Quest headsets</em>."</p>
<p>Regarding details for the headset, the official reveal is nothing we didn't already see in the leak. It is available to buy starting today at&nbsp;<strong>$399.99 USD</strong> for the standard 128GB headset. It comes in Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green with matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited edition standard Xbox controller. It also comes with an elite strap, three months of Meta Horizon+, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>
<p>"<em>We're proud of what we've built together with Meta</em>," said Wright, "<em>and we can't wait for you to dive into everything the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition has to offer. Whether you're streaming the latest Xbox Game Pass Ultimate titles, exploring the ever-expanding world of VR, or kicking back with immersive entertainment, this is just the beginning of what's possible when great teams and great technology come together</em>."</p>

			<p>THQ Nordic announced that its Digital Showcase will return on Friday, August 1st, broadcasting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/THQNordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> starting at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / 21:00 CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</p>
<p>The publisher confirmed that there will be a slew of updates on previously announced titles (including some release dates) and a few surprises for fans, including world premiere announcements. When it comes to the announced games, the following THQ Nordic titles are confirmed to be in the Digital Showcase: Gothic 1 Remake, Titan Quest II, Reanimal, The Eternal Life of Goldman, and Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Gothic 1 Remake has been in development at Alkimia Interactive since early 2020. The game will be expanded with around ten hours of extra content compared to the original, as the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told us</a> during Gamescom 2024. Last month, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an updated demo based on community feedback.</p>
<p>Grimlore's hack-and-slash action RPG Titan Quest II had its early access debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to Summer 2025. This is definitely one of the games that will receive a concrete date during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a> is the new horror game in development at Tarsier Studios, the makers of the first two Little Nightmares games. REANIMAL promises to be a darker tale where players step into the roles of a brother and sister who go through hell to rescue their missing friends. Exploring by boat and on land, they'll have to use their wits to survive, work together to escape the hellish island and the dark secret that haunts them.</p>
<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a platformer adventure game by Weappy Studio. Lastly, Bugbear's car destruction sequel, Wreckfest 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in March in early access, so there's a chance THQ Nordic will simply outline a new update. The game isn't expected to launch its 1.0 version until at least March 2026.</p>
