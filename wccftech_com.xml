			<p>At the end of the Ninja Gaiden 4 campaign, Yakumo acquires a fifth weapon, the Dark Dragon Blade, which allows him to fight the game's final boss on equal ground. Here's how to permanently unlock this powerful final weapon in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE: Method tested in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version after the completion of two different playtroughs, which the author played at Normal and Hard difficulty. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> is the final weapon for Yakumo. It is permanently unlocked by completing the following steps:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defeat the Dark Dragon</strong> in Chapter 19 to complete the main campaign. Any difficulty will do. This will unlock additional post-game content, including the <strong>Boss Trial</strong> challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Complete all of the Boss Trial challenges</strong> to permanently unlock the <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> and use it in Story Mode and Challenge Mode, including Chapter Challenge, Purgatorium re-runs, and Combat Trials.</li>
</ol>

<figure><figcaption><em>Use the Senjin War Brew item to increase your attack power and cut down the time needed to defeat the enemy in the Boss Trial challenges</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fighting and defeating all 13 of the main campaign bosses can take significant time and effort, especially powerful bosses like Ryu Hayabusa. However, there is a way to speed up the process considerably taking advantage of some of the game's difficulty mechanics.</p>



<p>This method uses the <strong>Hero Difficulty</strong> setting, which increases your damage output and dramatically lowers boss health, making the challenge trivial:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pre-Boss Difficulty Switch:</strong> Before confirming a Boss Trial challenge, press the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">R1/Right Button</strong> on your controller to switch to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Hero difficulty</strong>. And when prompted, activate<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> Auto-Dodge</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Auto-Assist</strong> to react automatically to enemy attacks, allowing you to just mash the attack buttons safely and cut down the time needed to defeat them.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Maximize Damage:</strong> During the trial, hold the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">R1 / Right Button</strong> to bring up the Item Wheel and use the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Senjin War Brew item</strong> to increase your damage output. Make sure to use the item again after the effect expires.</li>



<li><strong>Pick the Best Weapon</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">:</strong> At the start of each trial, press the left direction on your d-pad to select the <strong>Kage-Hiruko</strong> weapon. Being a ranged weapon, it allows you to continue attacking even when the enemy tries to get away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following this strategy, I completed all 13 trials in<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> 23 minutes and 4.412 seconds</strong>. Even accounting for menu loading and challenge setup, you will need <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">less than 30 minutes</strong> total to unlock the Dark Dragon Blade using this method.</p>



<p>Even with the Dark Dragon Blade in tow, Yakumo's journey is hardly a walk in the park at normal difficulty and above. Check out our other <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4-guides/">Ninja Gaiden 4 guides</a> to make the best out of the game's intricate combat mechanics.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Is Doing Better in Japan Thanks to Growing Importance of PC, Phil Spencer Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-doing-better-japan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-is-doing-better-in-japan-thanks-to-growing-importance-of-pc-phil-spencer-says.1333765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although the perception of Xbox is at an all-time low, the brand is doing better in Japan, a region that is notoriously one of the worst for Microsoft's video gaming division</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">Japanese publication Famitsu</a> during the recent Beyond the Strand event celebrating Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on Xbox's performance in Japan.</p>



<p>In the past year, the total playtime across the entire ecosystem has increased by around 20%. Although no exact figure has been confirmed, Spencer specified that the playtime growth is balanced between console, PC, and cloud. However, much of this total playtime increase is due to the increasing importance of the PC market in Japan.</p>



<p>To further boost Xbox's market share in Japan, Microsoft is planning to provide more content for Japanese players. Spencer confirmed that the publisher is currently talking with different partners while it is continuing to maintain a close relationship with Japanese developers like CAPCOM, Square Enix, SEGA, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Konami.</p>



<p>Speaking about the company's future in terms of hardware, Phil Spencer reiterated once again to Famitsu that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a new Xbox console is coming</a>, though he offered no additional details. However, the recent release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> provides an indication of the company's strategy, which aims to connect multiple devices under the Xbox platform.</p>



<p>Xbox's renewed focus on the Japanese market is no surprise. The company is attempting to cater more to the region's audience by setting the next entry in one of its hallmark franchises, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, in Japan and publishing games developed by Japanese studios, such as the highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which ended the series' long hiatus. Hopefully, the attention on the Japanese market will bring back other Japanese franchises that have been left dormant for a while.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-sells-5-8-million-units-in-debut-week.1333738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, The Pokémon Company has announced that the latest installment in the monster-catching series, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, has sold 5.8 million units in its debut week, with Nintendo confirming that around half of those sales were on the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>While still a very good sales performance, it lags a bit behind compared to the first Pokémon Legends, Arceus, which launched in early 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-sales-reach-6-5-million-holds-1-position-in-uk-boxed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 6.5 million units in its first week on the market</a>.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently posted Wccftech's review of the game</a>, penned by Nathan Birch, who rated the game 8.5 out of 10. Here's a summary of his time with this new Pokémon Legends:</p>



<p><em>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to Catch 'em All and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</em></p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/defect-an-immersive-squad-based-cyberpunk-shooter-gets-first-impressive-gameplay.1333735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the Galaxies Gaming Showcase, independent studio emptyvessel has unveiled the first gameplay footage of its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEFECT</a>. </p>



<p>The team, <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded by two former id Software developers</a>, provided an impressive demonstration of this immersive squad-based cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter game. According to emptyvessel, DEFECT is set in a futuristic, divided city where players battle it out in a world ruled by an enigmatic AI known as 'THE SYSTEM', while ruthless gangs and rogue law enforcement vie for supremacy. Players will choose from a selection of dangerous factions, including THE SYSTEM's own policing force, rogue police elements, and gangs vying for power. They will compete to achieve objectives such as smuggling guns, assassinating or kidnapping targets (including players), or arresting suspects. </p>



<p>Every mission in DEFECT is said to be different, whether you’re acting as the law, the lawless, or somewhere in between. Your choices determine how you play the game with friends in single-player, PvP, or co-op multiplayer modes. Squads of four players compete to complete multiple open-ended objectives and acquire valuable items and enhancements that can turn the tide of battle. The inevitable chaos means that no firefight ever ends the same way twice.</p>



<p>The game doesn't feature automatically regenerating health, unlike most recent shooters, so players must find health stations to heal themselves if they’re going to stay in the fight. These health stations generally have three charges. As seen in the trailer, DEFECT features extensive environmental destructibility, including multiple layers of destruction on each wall and item, and features such as dynamic dust that fills the room the more you destroy. This can be used strategically to reduce visibility in a space if you have equipment such as tactical goggles or to escape a dangerous situation quickly. Environmental interaction also includes players being able to flip tables and similar stuff to create cover and/or block paths.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>emptyvessel founder and game director Emanuel Palalic said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Our entire emptyvessel team is incredibly excited to show off this first look at gameplay in DEFECT as we’ve poured a ton of passion and time into crafting the game’s tone, atmosphere, and underlying systems. DEFECT is a HUD-less immersive shooter where any wall can be destroyed, gadgets and tools completely redefine how you approach combat, and every weapon or ammo type affects the world, interactables, and enemies in unique ways. The world is filled with emergent moments and dynamic branching narratives that react to player actions in real time.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/empty-vessel-closes-its-series-a-funding-for-defect-with-11-million-total-raised-single-player-support-and-console-launch-added-to-development-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered the news</a> that emptyvessel had raised $11 million in Series A funding <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-invests-in-defect-indie-developer-empty-vessel-to-help-get-defect-over-the-finish-line/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from NCSOFT</a>, 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games, to finish the game and add single player mode and console launches. However, it seems like DEFECT is currently only available for wishlisting on PC stores, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2470010/DEFECT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/defect-dde0e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/defect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a>. Those store pages actually provide interesting information, including the game's system requirements (which we added below) and the confirmation that it will come with a level editor and LAN multiplayer co-op/PvP support. DEFECT does not have a release window yet.</p>
