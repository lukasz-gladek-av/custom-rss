			<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/">gameplay and concept footage</a> of what would've been the sequel to Human Head Studios' 2006 game Prey leaked online, published on YouTube across multiple videos from a channel listed under '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.' Today, that same channel no longer has any of the Prey 2 videos it previously had publicly listed, and instead, more gameplay footage appeared on an old <a href="https://forums.duke4.net/topic/12181-leaked-prey-1995/page__pid__385337#entry385337">Duke4 thread</a>, spotted by New Blood Interactive's <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1964840297889997048">Dave Oshry</a>.</p>



<p>The original post includes an Imgur link, though following it at the time of this writing is fruitless, sense the page no longer appears. Oshry, however, compiled the footage and put it together in a nearly five-minute-long video that shows a very solid-looking slice of what Human Head Studios was cooking up with Prey 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The footage shows that Human Head Studios was building something that, if it had made it to release, would've been compared to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, since it appears to be well ahead of its time with the kind of sci-fi world and setting it would have featured.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is actually the third time in the last week that Human Head Studios' Prey has come up. In a <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">recent interview</a> with former Bethesda executive Pete Hines, besides Hines taking the time to comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">on subscription services and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass</a>, he also talked about the struggle he faced when it came time to decide what Arkane Austin would work on next, and how he lost in the battle for its name. </p>



<p>"<em>Don't even get me started on that</em>," Hines said in regard to Arkane Austin naming its 2017 game Prey. "<em>I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name. I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team – brand, PR and community – and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game. I regret that I lost that battle. But nobody on this planet could have put more of a good faith effort into changing minds on that. My whole point was, look how much time we spend talking about what the game is versus why it's called this and like, that is wasted energy. That is wasted excitement. We could be turning that into something positive.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if more Prey 2 footage is published, or if an unreleased build of what Human Head Studios had appears online. For now, we can only watch and wonder at what might've been if Human Head's story had gone differently.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED is hard at work on multiple projects at this very moment, including its highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. We still have a while until it's ready for release, as we learned earlier this year, the project <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">has only entered pre-production</a>, and we still have plenty of questions about what the sequel will look like, though if Keanu Reeves gets his way, we can count on at least one familiar face in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">IGN</a> and promoting his new film, Good Fortune, Keanu Reeves confirmed that he would "<em>absolutely</em>" return to play Johnny Silverhand in the coming sequel.</p>



<p>"<em>Absolutely. I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again</em>," Reeves said. Of course, for anyone who's played Cyberpunk 2077, there are doubts as to how Silverhand could make a return at all, but there's always the chance we see Reeves step back into the role in a flashback scene or something similar.</p>



<p>The last time we heard about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was when Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith spoke about what he saw on his last visit to CDPR, calling the new location they were developing "<em></em><em>like Chicago gone wrong.'</em>"</p>



<p>It would be nice to hear more soon, but the reality is we likely won't get any major details about the coming sequel until CD Projekt RED is through with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/">The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
