			<p>Fable, the next entry in the long-running role-playing game series in development by Playground Games, will not be released this year as previously announced.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a> podcast, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan confirmed they have decided to give the game more time and will now release on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date. While this wasn't the news fans were expecting to hear, the Xbox Studios head assured fans that the game will definitely be worth the wait, as it will be the most beautifully realized version of Albion that players have ever seen.</p>
<p>In addition to confirming the game's delay, today's episode of the official Xbox podcast also provided a new look at Fable with a stunning pre-alpha gameplay video that definitely backs up Craig Duncan's statements on the game's quality. You can check out the footage below.</p>

<p>Fable launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a> to launch on PlayStation 5 and even Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time as it does on the other formats, but a console multiplatform release has yet to be officially confirmed, and likely won't until a solid release date is confirmed.</p>
