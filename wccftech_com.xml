			<p>Developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/vigor-pc-release-early-access/">Bohemia Interactive</a> has announced the next expansion for DayZ, titled Badlands, which adds a new desert environment in the Nasdara province, new variants of infected that have adapted to the harsh rule of the desert, and more when it arrives sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Badlands adds "<em>the largest official map in the game's history,</em>" according to Bohemia Interactive in a press release, with 267 square kilometers of desert for players to explore in Nasdara's desert. It's also not just dry sand as far as the eye can see. There are towns, ruins, oil fields, and plenty of environmental storytelling to discover in the post-war desert.</p>
<p><iframe title="DayZ Badlands - Expansion Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oad7AX7gWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The desert also brings a few desert-specific survival elements, meaning players will need to keep an eye on how hydrated they are and stay out of the sun to keep cool and alive. And as previously mentioned, there's more to watch out for beyond the regular-world desert hazards, with new variants of infected that have all been warped by the desert.</p>
<p>Bohemia Interactive also adds that this expansion will feature "<em>player-driven storytelling</em>," as players form factions and discover "<em>forgotten secrets.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Bohemia Interactive vows to push the boundaries of what survival means in the DayZ universe with DayZ Badlands</em>," the studio writes in a press release. "<em>From the scorched cities to the silent sands, Nasdara is a land shaped by war, reset by the outbreak, now waiting for new stories to be written in its sands</em>."</p>
<p>This is a big switch from the last major expansion for DayZ, which was<a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-frostline-expansion-announced-livonia-dlc-free/"> Frostline</a>, taking players to the dead of winter, instead of the desert. Hopefully, we'll know more about this expansion soon, like a proper release date instead of its current release window for next year, and get a better look at what to expect when we head into the desert.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cube-q-a-%E2%80%93-mundfish-confirms-dungeon-like-zones-dynamic-events-and-regular-post-launch-support.1229988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The unveiling of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a> certainly surprised fans of Atomic Heart. While a sequel was more than warranted given that over 10 million people played the original game, they definitely weren't expecting to also get an online multiplayer spin-off featuring MMORPG elements.</p>
<p>When we contacted Mundfish to <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about Atomic Heart 2</a>, we also set up an interview to discuss The CUBE. Once again, studio founder, CEO, and game director Robert Bagratuni kindly obliged, allowing us to craft this exclusive interview dedicated to the exciting project and the brand new split-rendering technology created specifically for it. Bagratuni also discussed the increased team size to handle all these projects, the current state of the game (internal playtesting), and the desire to support The CUBE well after launch with new content and features.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded? What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How many developers from Mundfish are working on The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>We've grown significantly since the development of Atomic Heart 1. Back then, the entire game was created by a team of around 50 developers, growing to about 80 by the time of release. Today, the structure is quite different: the team has more than doubled in size, and we now have multiple dedicated teams. One team is fully focused on DLC#4 for Atomic Heart 1, another is working on Atomic Heart 2, and a separate team is developing The CUBE.</p>
<p>Many of those working on The CUBE joined the studio after the project received internal greenlight, especially given its multiplayer focus, which required new expertise. That said, of course, there’s crossover between teams, particularly in areas like narrative, where maintaining consistency across our universe is essential. The same goes for shared characters and cutscene production. So, while it’s difficult to give a precise headcount, what’s clear is that each current project is being developed by equally strong teams that are significantly larger than what we had during AH1.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with the concept for this game?</strong></p>
<p>It all started with a phone call - one of those long, uneventful conversations where your mind begins to drift. I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded?</p>
<p>What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something. Oleg Gorodishenin, our executive producer and co-founder, and I quietly excused ourselves from the call. The next two hours were pure creative flow - and by the end of it, The CUBE was born.</p>
<p><strong>Chronologically, does it take place before or after Atomic Heart 2?</strong></p>
<p>Great question, but we’re being careful not to reveal too much just yet. What we can say is that The CUBE takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. As for how it connects to Atomic Heart 2, there’s definitely a timeline relationship, but we’ll let players piece that together as more is revealed. The CUBE isn’t just a standalone concept, it’s a key part of the evolving universe.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the split-rendering system? Why is it unique and how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>To bring The CUBE to life, we had to develop entirely new systems that could support a world in constant motion, both structurally and technically. At the heart of this is our split-rendering system, a breakthrough method that allows thousands of objects on what we call “tiles” (or world clusters) to move and rotate in real time across massive multiplayer environments. This isn’t just visual spectacle - it directly affects gameplay, traversal, and the rules of physics inside the world.</p>
<p>The system works by splitting how motion, rendering, and synchronization are handled between client and server, making it possible to maintain seamless transitions, dynamic gravity, and accurate object tracking, even when the entire world around you is shifting. It enables what we think of as a truly living environment, and it's currently patent-pending.</p>
<p>The CUBE is developed on Unreal Engine 5, and we’ve implemented several custom modifications to both its physics and rendering subsystems to fully support our approach. UE5 gives us so much development freedom and the visual fidelity to match the scale and ambition of this concept. At the end of the day, this isn’t just tech for the sake of tech - it’s what allows The Cube to feel unique, unpredictable, and fully alive in the hands of the player.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time. Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You've presented the game as an MMORPG shooter. Could you share which MMORPG elements will be featured?</strong></p>
<p>At its core, The CUBE is built around a deep narrative set in the evolving Atomic Universe. We’re calling it an MMORPG shooter because it blends that strong narrative foundation with large-scale systems: deep and persistent character progression, customizable loadouts, long-term gear upgrades, quests, and evolving objectives, like expeditions, shaped by the community. But unlike traditional MMOs, The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time.</p>
<p>Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any extraction shooter modes or elements in the game? How does PvP work in the game?</strong></p>
<p>While The CUBE offers a wide range of gameplay experiences from exploration and constant progression to narrative-driven quests and deep social interactions, combat is just one of the tools players use to achieve their goals. At its core, The CUBE is closer to classic MMORPGs than to extraction shooters or battle royales, which usually don’t focus on the above.</p>
<p>That said, elements commonly associated with extraction gameplay, like venturing into dangerous zones and returning with valuable loot, are present in many RPGs such as Diablo, WoW, and Destiny, right? In that medium, The CUBE shares a similar dynamic: players will have opportunities to explore, take risks and return with meaningful rewards. But that’s only one layer or, let’s say, face of The CUBE - the overall experience will consist of a mix of many more gameplay elements. Our task is to offer players something fresh - something they really want and are not tired of yet.</p>
<p>Even though we’re not ready to reveal everything just yet, observant players may have already noticed several hints about what’s to come on the game’s Steam page. A closer look might uncover some intriguing new details. So, stay tuned, more details about the game systems are coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any dungeon-like experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as part of the exploration, players will find dungeon-like zones with high stakes, tough enemies, and unique rewards. The deeper you go, the weirder it gets.</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences in terms of character progression with AH2?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a great question, but it’s still too early to go into detail. We’ll share more when the time is right. But we can say that, as a multiplayer project, The CUBE will let you shape and adapt your gameplay style to respond effectively to the ever-changing world around you.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share the business model for The CUBE (free to play or premium)?</strong></p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the business model for The CUBE, so it’s not something we’re ready to reveal just yet. Our focus right now is on building a great game, and whatever model we choose, it will be designed to support a fair, player-first experience.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What is the current state of the game? Are you planning several beta tests to receive feedback from fans?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the post-launch support of The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>The CUBE is designed from the ground up as a continuing experience. Post-launch, we’ll be regularly rolling out new content, quests, story beats, events, and features to keep the world evolving. This world is built to grow, impress, and surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-test/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-test-video-highlights-how-much-the-system-can-improve-ark-one-of-the-worst-switch-ports-ever.1229958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mod test was shared online this week, highlighting how much the new system can improve ARK: Survival Evolved, one of the worst original Switch ports released to date, even at resolutions higher than the vanilla 1080p.</p>
<p>The new test video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a>, compares the game running on an overclocked Nintendo Switch and on the current generation system with some graphics mods like an FPS unlocker setting the cap to 60 FPS and increased resolution. At base 1080p resolution, ARK runs great on Nintendo Switch 2, consistently hitting the modded 60 FPS cap without the massive stuttering seen on the original console. The new generation system handles 1440p resolution quite well, not hitting the 60 FPS, but keeping a relatively steady 50 FPS range performance that's more than playable. At 4K resolution, however, the system begins to struggle, as the game runs in the 25 FPS range, and textures start showing some issues likely related to RAM, although the absence of the massive stuttering seen on the original system still makes this impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60 FPS / 4K Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY16ahbIAB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those not in the know, seeing Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods already may seem surprising, especially as the console hasn't been hacked yet, but unlocking framerates and increasing resolution in select backward-compatible titles is entirely possible by importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed. Using this method, naga tested out how much the system can be pushed by running games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/">Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation</a> with higher resolutions and unlocked framerates.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods, however, are not needed to enjoy improved backward-compatible titles, as many games can use the system's increased hardware specifications over its predecessor to offer improved framerates and more, even without dedicated patches.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-has-an-expanded-rpg-layer-and-a-much-larger-world-with-dynamic-weather-and-time/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Atomic Heart 2 at Summer Game Fest 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish Founder, CEO, and Game Director Robert Bagratuni, whose interviews were often featured on Wccftech throughout the development of the first installment, to learn more about the sequel of the popular first-person shooter game.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole chat, two topics were worth highlighting in a separate story: the greater focus on roleplaying game elements and the larger, more dynamic world that players will find in the sequel. Here are the respective quotes from Bagratuni:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before. </em><em>When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect. Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, Bagratuni also told us that Atomic Heart 2 is 'a few years out', partly because the team wants to improve the sequel's polish, make it tighter and more immersive. However, we'll keep covering any relevant news and rumors throughout the whole development phase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has plenty of new features over its predecessor, including some RPG-lite mechanics like Sam's Stats, which determine how well he performs specific actions. And in true RPG fashion, these stats can be increased during the course of the game, making Sam even better at traversing terrain, resisting getting knocked out by specific attacks, and so on.</p>
<h2>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250627130510-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are self-explanatory, and the in-game menu provides a good overview of how each stat impacts Sam's performance and by how much. What the game doesn't tell you, however, is how to level them up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terrain Traversal</strong> indicates Sam's ability to resist fatigue while traversing difficult terrain, such as rivers and slopes.&nbsp;The higher this stat, the slower Endurance will reduce when he does so. This stat is increased by traversing this difficult terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Carry Capacity</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at carrying cargo, granting him an increased capacity of additional kilograms depending on the stat's level. This stat is increased by traveling with plenty of cargo, the higher the weight, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Endurance</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at resisting fatigue while traveling, which is indicated by the bar located on the Stamina Gauge. The higher this stat, the slower Fatigue will accumulate. This stat is increased by running over long distances.</li>
<li><strong>KO Resistance</strong> indicates how much Sam can resist getting knocked out by specific enemy attacks, losing balance, and dropping cargo. The higher the stat, the harder it will be for enemies to knock the porter off balance and steal his cargo. This stat is increased by blocking enemy attacks and centering Sam's balance while under attack holding the L2 and R2 buttons. Doing so when unbalanced and not in combat does not count.</li>
<li><strong>Lung Capacity</strong> indicates how much Sam can hold his breath using the Stamina Gauge to easily make it past human enemies and BTs undetected. The higher the stat, the higher his lung capacity will be. To increase this stat, all you need to do is hold Sam's breath by pressing the R1 button.</li>
<li><strong>Strand Skills</strong> indicate how good Sam is at binding enemies undetected from behind using his Strand. The higher the stat is, the bigger is the distance from which Sam can bind unaware human enemies. To increase this stat, simply bind enemies using the weapon repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the Stats above, Sam also has <strong>Mastery Stats for weapon types</strong>, which increase Reload Speed and lower Reticle Sway and Recoil the higher they are. Master for each weapon type is increased by defeating enemies with the related weapon type.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Stat to Increase as Quickly as Possible</h2>
<p>While increasing all the stats outlined above provides some tangible benefits, some are more impactful than others and can make Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more enjoyable. <strong>The most important of them, regardless of playstyle, is Carry Capacity</strong>, and it's easy to understand why as soon as the game begins. An increased carry capacity makes it easier for Sam to carry many items, which is beneficial for deliveries and combat. While it's true that vehicles eventually make Carry Capacity not that important later on, there will be plenty of times during the course of the game when you cannot use one, having to rely on Sam's foot to complete a delivery. In combat, having a higher Carry Capacity means being able to carry more weapons, which is always a great help. As such, you will want to increase this stat as quickly as possible, and you can do so already during Sam's time in Mexico at the start of the game. <strong>Make sure to travel as close to maximum carry capacity as possible from one place to the other, avoid enemy camps, and it shouldn't take too long to level up the stat up a couple of ranks</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasing every other stat, however, is entirely dependent on your playstyle. If you like to take on enemies head-on, increasing Lung Capacity and Striking Skills won't be very beneficial for you, and you should focus on Weapon Mastery instead, as well as KO Endurance to avoid getting your cargo stolen in case something goes wrong during a fight. If you're a Metal Gear Solid fan and prefer a stealthy approach, however, Lung Capacity and Strand Skills are more valuable stats to improve. Ultimately, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a very flexible game that can be played with different playstyles, providing everything needed to make any playstyle enjoyable.</p>
