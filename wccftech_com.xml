			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 is in the works, alongside PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, sources close to Rockstar Games revealed that the studio is working on a port of the excellent open-world game originally released in 2018 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that could be released as early as this year. Besides working on this port, Rockstar Games is reportedly working on a Red Dead Redemption 2 update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S that will improve graphics and performance. This patch could be released with the Nintendo Switch 2 or later.</p>
<p>While Rockstar Games releasing a Red Dead Redemption 2 current generation upgrade via a free patch doesn't precisely align with how the studio has handled current generation upgrades, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI having been delayed to 2026</a>, both the developer and Take-Two are likely looking at ways to fill their release schedule for the rest of the year, and releasing new versions of their highly celebrated open-world game would be an excellent way of doing so. Still, without official confirmation, we must take everything above with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 direct-feed footage is now available online, further highlighting how the system may be heavily underestimated.</p>
<p>The new footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den Faminico Gamer</a>, provides a new look at the new Switch 2 port of the game launching together with the system next month, highlighting how great the game looks and runs on the system, possibly even better than most expected, further suggesting that the system may be underestimated regarding what it can achieve with the help of tech like NVIDIA DLSS, which the game has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">confirmed</a> of using.</p>
<p><iframe title="ニンテンドースイッチ2版『サイバーパンク2077』ゲームプレイ映像 ジョイコンを振って刀やマンティスブレードで敵をめった斬りにする「モーション操作」や、直感的にエイムできる「ジャイロ操作」にも対応" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VVHAa4dEbA?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From every showing, it's clear that CD Projekt Red has put some serious effort into the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 port, ensuring it looks and runs well. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">Earlier this month</a>, studio SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that getting the game to run on the system didn't require a lot of effort, but getting it to run well was a challenge. Though some compromises had to be made, they don't impact the game's artistic vision, which definitely looks the case, judging from the new footage. The fact that the entire game is included in the retail edition's cartridge is another sign that CDPR put a lot of thought into the port, as they wanted to achieve a plug-and-play experience that is dear to Nintendo users without requiring any additional downloads.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console releases in North America, Europe and Japan. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

			<p>Hideo Kojima doesn't plan on stopping making video games even after he has passed away, as he will leave behind a USB stick with game ideas.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/">VGC</a>, the legendary game designer commented on his future as a creative, revealing that an unspecified illness he suffered during the pandemic, an eye operation and people around him passing away made him realize he was getting old, and wouldn't have all the time in the world to continue making games. This not only made him reevaluate his priorities, making him set aside the idea of directing a movie, but also convinced him to leave a USB stick with his ideas as some sort of will to Kojima Productions, which could continue making games even after he is gone, and not just stick to managing the IPs that have been created, including Physint, which is being made because Kojima-san realized a lot of people want him to make something like the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>In the latest issue of Edge Magazine, Hideo Kojima also commented on his next game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which is set to become more popular than its predecessor, going by the positive reception it is receiving in test reviews. The legendary game designer, however, is not entirely happy with this, as he would have liked the game to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">more controversial</a>, not desiring to make games with mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Though it will likely be more popular than its predecessor, there's no doubt Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be full of those trademark Hideo Kojima moments that make his games so unique. Thankfully, it won't be long until we can experience them ourselves, as the game launches on June 26th on PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>According to insider Dusk Golem, who is often well-informed about CAPCOM's roadmap, Resident Evil 9 should still be planned for a 2025 reveal and subsequent 2026 launch. Here's what the leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1922384237392523592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1922384237392523592%7Ctwgr%5E82e2561ec4f34e05178b2da1d63217fb52be56fe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-resident-evil-9-will-be-announced-this-year-1544383%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>It's almost 100% for sure being revealed this year and releasing next year. Doubt they'll delay more. The question comes if its being revealed this summer or at TGA for example this year, &amp; if its releasing this fiscal year (ending March 31st, 2026) or next fiscal year late 2026.</em></p>
<p>Dusk Golem previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-signapore-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Resident Evil 9 would be set on a Singapore-inspired island, more specifically in a rural town. The rural town setting was already explored in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Village, although of course, those took place in Spain and Romania, respectively. The Southeast Asian setting alone should provide some freshness.</p>
<p>Last year, Dusk Golem also <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that both Resident Evil 9 and Monster Hunter Wilds would be open world games. The latter was released in late February and was indeed an open world, so the insider was probably right about the next Resident Evil, too.</p>
<p>More recently, Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> why the new game is taking a long time. CAPCOM is reportedly reinventing the series and trying new things, much like it did with Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil VII. Fans shouldn't expect it to play like Resident Evil Village. Whether that means a return to third-person view remains to be seen.</p>
<p>When it comes to the reveal, there are a number of options for the publisher, from the Summer Game Fest taking place next month to Gamescom in August and then finally Tokyo Game Show in September. Of course, it's also possible for CAPCOM to play coy until The Game Awards in December, but that would likely mean a release window in the latter half of 2026.</p>
