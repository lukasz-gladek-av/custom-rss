			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is making the jump to PS5 sometime in late 2025, developer GSC Game World has announced. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the official STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl X account, and with a short teaser trailer published through IGN, featuring characters in the game playing STALKER 2 on what looks like a STALKER-looking version of a PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>"<em>The Perimeter expands - STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is officially announced for PlayStation 5</em>," the <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1942932316466065731">studio wrote in its post</a>. It's currently available to wish list on the PlayStation Store for those who want to ensure they get a notification when pre-orders go live and the release date is announced. </p>

<p>STALKER 2 launched towards the end of 2024 on PC and as a console-exclusive for Xbox Series X/S devices, though the fact that every other STALKER game is available on PlayStation was at least a tip that those with nothing but a PS5 at home just had to be patient if they wanted to dive into the latest entry in the long-running series. </p>



<p>When it first launched, it arrived in a touch of controversy, with a number of outlets reviewing a version of the game that was decidedly broken prior to launch, only for a significant portion of those issues to be fixed with a patch that arrived just in time for launch. It still wasn't perfect, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo noted in his review</a>, but even with all the bugs, he still marked it as "<em>a worthy successor of the original in every regard."</em> Even with all its issues, earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/">STALKER 2 surpassed 6 million players worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>GSC Game World has continued to patch the game and release fixes, the most recent of which arrived just <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/">last month with a significant patch that added modding tools for PC players.</a> By the time it makes it onto PS5, there's a solid chance that PS5 and PS5 Pro players will get the best console experience from day-one, simply because they'll get to play a version that, hopefully, isn't as riddled with bugs as the game was when it launched on Xbox Series X/S. </p>

			<p>Playing the Xenoblade Chronicles series on Nintendo Switch 2 seems to be the way to enjoy Monolith Soft's excellent RPGs at their best, but the system's backward compatibility feature's image quality and performance improvements are still not enough to make them truly shine.</p>



<p>A new analysis shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NinWRTV">Nintendo World Report </a>on YouTube takes a look at how all the entries in the series run on Nintendo Swicth 2, starting with Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition, the game that runs the best on the original Switch. On the new generation system, the remaster of the Wii U entry in the series maxes out the dynamic resolution range seen on the Switch, running at locked 1080p and 720p resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, with solid image quality.</p>



<p>Things are much different in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. While the second entry in the series remains one of the most impressive Switch games ever, thanks to its advanced visual features like high quality character models and post-processing and the volumetric sea of clouds, these features came at a heavy cost in terms of resolution and framerate, which are very low on the original Switch. On Nintendo Switch 2, the game fares a little better, as it runs at locked 720p and 576p resolutions, the maximum possible resolution in the game's dynamic resolution ranges, in docked and handheld modes, but still with the same TAA solution and sharpening filter, which heavily impact image quality. The game's expansion fares a little better thanks to the less aggressive sharpening filter, but resolutions remain low. Performance, at least, becomes more solid with a locked 30 FPS framerate. Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch 2 fares not too differently from its sequel,  with locked 720p and 576p resolutions, and slightly better image quality thanks to the absence of the infamous sharpening filter.,</p>



<p>Better tailored to the capabilities of the original Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's image quality was considerably better than its predecessor's, also thanks to improved temporal upscaling. On Nintendo Switch 2, the third entry in the series runs at docked 720p resolution, but only at 480p resolution in handheld mode, which makes sense considering how this resolution scaled to 720p and 1080p, but ends up making the game's handheld mode on Switch 2 the worst out of all entries in the series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While even these minor improvements are welcome, there's no denying that dedicated Nintendo Switch 2 patches would be quite welcome to make the Xenoblade Chronicles series shine on the system. Hopefully, they will receive the same treatment as other Switch games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">Splatoon 3</a>, which has been massively improved on the new system with a resolution boost of up to six times.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-group-franchise-model-dan-ayoub/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-group-shifts-to-%E2%80%98franchise-model%E2%80%99-internally-will-be-led-by-ex-halo-veteran.1239081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, we learned that the Dungeons &amp; Dragons group within Wizards of the Coast would shift to a 'franchise model' internally, where everything about the beloved fantasy IP sits under the same roof. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> by Dan Ayoub, a game industry veteran who spent a long time at Microsoft working on the Halo franchise, from Halo: Reach to Halo: Infinite. He left in 2021 to become Vice President at Certain Affinity, though that didn't last long, as he <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-wars-head-dan-ayoub-wizards-of-the-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved again to Wizards of the Coast in 2022</a>, first as VP/Head of Studios and then as Senior VP of Digital Games. Now, Ayoub has been promoted to head the whole Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise:</p>



<p><em>So, what happened today? We shifted our structure internally and D&amp;D moved to a full franchise model, meaning everything: books, video games, film, and TV – everything touching the franchise lives under one roof. The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</em></p>



<p><em>Finally, in a moment that doubtlessly has my childhood self doing cartwheels (and okay, maybe some old man cartwheels too), I've been asked to lead this new group! As of today, I am thrilled, humbled, and somewhat freaked out to be leading the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise for Wizards of the Coast.</em></p>



<p>Ayoub mentioned film and TV, but there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no publicly known plans to create a sequel to Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a>, which only barely recouped its budget, and work on the TV series that was going to air on Paramount+ has been paused.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast does have plenty of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games in the works, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>The digital fantasy tabletop adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out in late 2025;</li>



<li>Project Baxter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a co-op game in development at Starbreeze</a> and scheduled to launch next year;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The company is also hard at work on the future of the Baldur's Gate series, of course. In March, Dan Ayoub <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-fans-will-know-more-about-the-franchises-future-in-short-order-says-hasbro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> fans of the franchise would know more about what's coming next in 'short order'.</p>

			<p>A new Stellar Blade mod now available for download brings significant visual improvements by introducing ray-traced global illumination to the game.</p>



<p>The mod, developed by Atlas813 and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/1227?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, doesn't require any paid shared or third party assets so users don't need anything else other than ReShade to use it. Besides introducing RTGI with proper light bouncing and diffuse lights, the mod introduces ambient light correction, a sharpening effect that only sharpens close objects, among other features that introduce significant visual improvements as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below taken at 1080p resolution, max settings, and NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>
