			<p>Even before <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem was formally announced earlier this year</strong></a>, it was widely rumored that Leon Kennedy, the protagonist of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, would have been one of the protagonists of the ninth entry in the series. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">With the development team never confirming whether the character was in or not</a></strong> following the game's official announcement, however, it seemed like the rumors were wrong, but today it has been finally confirmed that the character will indeed be in the game in some capacity.</p>



<p>Leon in Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed today via a PlayStation Store leak, which shows a new cover art for the game featuring both Grace and the beloved classic series character. The new cover art has been confirmed to be on the PlayStation Store by multiple users, so it's most likely real.</p>

<p>As the PlayStation Store has a nasty habit at leaking information about games a few days before the official announcements, there's little doubt at this point that the first footage of Leon in Resident Evil Requiem will be shown during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>, which will take place on December 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-will-combat-work-in-resident-evil-requiem">How will Combat Work in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/"><strong>first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage</strong></a> surfaced online, showing Grace fighting enemies with a battle system that is reminiscent of that of the fourth entry in the series. As the character is likely not going to be a combat expert like a battle-hardened veteran like Leon, there's a very good chance the two characters will have access to different combat skills that should make the experience deeper, more engaging, and, most of all, more varied.</p>



<p>Although the confirmation that Leon Kennedy will be in Resident Evil Requiem is very welcome news for fans of the series (and one that will make them look even closer at the reveal trailer, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">said to have the first hints of the character being in the game</strong></a>), I expected the new entry in the series to be an excellent survival horror game, nonetheless. I had the chance to try it out earlier this year during Gamescom ahead of its launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2, and<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> I was thoroughly impressed by its great atmosphere and the ability to switch between first and third-person camera</strong>.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/take-two-hired-perfect-dark-head-and-creative-director-found-new-2k-studio/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In September, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Take-Two tried to save the Perfect Dark reboot that was in development at The Initiative (with the help of Crystal Dynamics), but an agreement could not be reached with IP holder Microsoft about the future of the franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Schreier has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed up</a>, adding that Take-Two has nonetheless hired two key developers from the Perfect Dark team to found a new 2K studio. They are Darrell Gallagher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-tomb-raider-david-gallaggher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Studio Head at the Initiative</a> (and formerly Studio Head at Crystal Dynamics), and Brian Horton. The latter worked at Crystal Dynamics with Gallagher on 2013's Tomb Raider and 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider before moving to Insomniac, where he contributed to many games, including Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine. He had <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-gets-ex-marvels-wolverine-lead-as-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined The Initiative in late 2024 as the new Creative Director</a>, but the project, as we all know, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially canceled in July 2025</a> by Microsoft, which also shut down the studio.</p>



<p>It's not the first time Take-Two scoops up an industry veteran to found a new studio within 2K. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-new-studio-michael-condrey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already happened a few years ago with Michael Condrey</a>, the former studio head of Sledgehammer Games and, before that, co-creator of Dead Space (alongside Glen Schofield) at Visceral Games. That team, based in Silicon Valley, is known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Union</a>, though Condrey himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-removes-31st-union-president-michael-condrey-insists-project-ethos-is-still-being-worked-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was fired earlier this year</a> following the tepid response to the studio's free-to-play roguelike hero third-person shooter game Project ETHOS, which is, however, reportedly still in development.</p>



<p>Given the average time of triple-A game development in 2025, we may not hear about this new Take-Two studio for another three or four years. Still, we'll keep you updated on any further rumors and leaks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Journalist Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the current developer of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. It's Mad Head Games, the Serbian studio behind defunct hack 'n' slash action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/pagan-online-revealed-debut-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pagan Online</a> and sci-fi action/adventure game Scars Above (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/scars-above-the-definition-of-one-and-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). They're also working on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we previewed at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Mad Head Games is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive, following the split from the Embracer Group. We knew that a team at Saber was working on the game. A year and a half ago, their CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the development was progressing well.</p>



<p>Let's rewind the long and problematic development story of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. The first rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-might-be-getting-a-reimagining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in January 2020</a>, before the world was even fully aware of COVID-19. The game was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the September 2021 PlayStation Showcase as an exclusive for PC and PlayStation 5. Back then, Aspyr Media was working on it, but their project <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was paused in mid-2022</a> following an unsuccessful demo presentation to Sony and Lucasfilm. Shortly afterward, we learned that the developer had changed, but we never knew the exact studio until now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Totilo revealed that Disney and Lucasfilm Games have been planning a Star Wars KOTOR II remake (codenamed Juliet) as well, as recently as March 2025, which would also include the content cut from the original version. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1phogew/comment/nt0ij6e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a Reddit post</a>, he then explained that the info comes from a legal deposition:</p>



<p><em>Yes, this is more than a rumor because the person who talked about it during their legal deposition was Douglas Reilly, the longtime VP of Lucasfilm Games. The reason for the March cut-off on this is because that's when the deposition was. At that time, he said it "is still technically on the road map” and that “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR I." I don't know about the status of either KOTOR remake since then.</em></p>



<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was originally developed by BioWare. Launched in July 2003, it is considered to be one of the best RPGs of all time, although its combat system would feel pretty dated nowadays and must certainly be among the most significant changes in the KOTOR Remake, just like with Final Fantasy VII. Its sequel, KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian and launched in December 2004. It was also well received, although not quite to the extent of the first franchise entry.</p>



<p>As a separate rumor from Totilo's reveal, leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1997385253795590237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that a major Star Wars game announcement, whose title ends with "The Old Republic," is coming soon, presumably hinting at a reveal during The Game Awards 2025. That said, take this piece of info with a grain of salt.</p>
