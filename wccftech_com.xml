			<p><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was one of the biggest commercial successes in 2025, not just for <strong>EA</strong>, but across the video game industry overall. It was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>, and as of November 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">it was the best-selling game in the US overall</a>. But while EA has been enjoying its commercial success, the players around the game have begun to feel the lack of new content, with concurrent player numbers (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">at least on Steam</a>) practically falling off the map compared to where they were when the game launched.</p>



<p>That's why, when EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">today's January Update blog</a> that the next major batch of content, <strong>Season 2</strong>, wouldn't arrive until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, one of the first comments, which sums up community sentiment quite well, was, "<em>Is this a joke?</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">October 10, 2025</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Season 1 and its highly anticipated REDSEC battle royale mode launching on October 28, 2025</a>. Since October 28, there have been content updates for the game as part of Season 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/">with the introduction of new maps and limited-time modes</a>, but the launch of Season 2 arriving in February means that players will have gone almost four months without any major new content.</p>



<p>To a certain vintage of player, it may seem ludicrous for this to be an issue the community is complaining about, but that's simply the world we live in when it comes to modern-day live-service titles. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong>, for example, doesn't let its community go a single month without new content, with a new season every two months and new characters and maps introduced at the halfway point. </p>



<p>Like it or not, that is the pace of modern live-service games, and while Battlefield 6 and Marvel Rivals offer different experiences to players, if EA hopes to keep up with free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals, it can't keep players waiting months for new maps.</p>



<p>In fairness to EA and Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect), the team is aware that this is a longer wait than players would have expected, and claims the decision was made "<em>in order to keep our promise</em>" to the community to deliver the best possible experience. </p>



<p>"<em>During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2</em>," the team writes. </p>



<p>"<em>Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2</em>."</p>



<p>As part of Season 1 getting extended, EA is adding new cosmetics, free rewards, and XP bonuses for players, including a Frostfire Bonus Path that players will be able to complete alongside the Season 1 battle pass rather than having to choose between them, which is how players currently work through the several battle pass paths. There will also be a Valentine's Day update arriving later, with double XP weekends, login rewards, and more. </p>



<p>It's a nice attempt from EA to try and hold players over until Season 2 is ready, but it's doubtful community sentiment will change until we start to see what Season 2 will bring. Hopefully, it's enough to bring the players who have dropped Battlefield 6 due to a lack of content back to the game. Otherwise, EA and Battlefield Studios may be in for a rough 2026.</p>

<p>Besides supporting these other mods, <strong><em><a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/features">The Witcher Online</a></em></strong> features equipment sync thanks to which each players will be able to see their their equipped armor, swords, crossbow, scabbards, hair style, and face mark, full movement and combat sync corresponding to <strong>Geralt's</strong> animations, emotes that other players can see using corresponding emote commands in the console, statuses display and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hazelight Studios</strong> has made a name for itself by creating excellent couch co-op games, with the team's latest release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong>, being one of 2025's best games, earning it several nominations at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a>,</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It was even one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's picks for our Best Games of 2025</a>, and according to the studio's creative director, <strong>Josef Fares</strong>, the studio's next game will be "<em>better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>This comes from a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>, where Fares talked about a lot more than just what he expects from the studio's next game. He talked about how the team at Hazelight is consistently raising its bar, which is why he added, "<em>I feel extremely confident of everything we’re doing. I can easily say that our next game is better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>That confidence comes from the culture that has been built at the studio since its debut game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Hazelight currently stands at a team of <strong>80 people</strong>, and keeping as much of that team together since its founding has been a key part of the studio's success, as they've all grown together with Josef Fares leading the charge with his "<em>F*** s*** up mentality, without f***ing up</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Split Fiction’s Josef Fares on Clair Obscur success, AI fears and EA’s reputation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9WyRvP53_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hazelight's games are known for being creatively supercharged, which Fares credits to his ability to "<em>wake up the creative monster</em>" inside the developers at Hazelight. A task easier said than done, though, as we're often the ones to get in our own way.</p>



<p>"<em>People put a lot of limitations on themselves, and it’s mainly coming from their mind</em>. <em>Once you stop listening to that, shit will start happening. And how do you do it? Well, first, you practically push that person… in a nice way, obviously. You say, ‘not this’, ‘let’s do that’. ‘that’s been done before, let’s try this way’. And eventually they come into this ‘f*** s*** up’ mentality where they’re like, ‘okay, there are no limits’. And then you make that person feel confident that there really are no limits. People have so many possibilities inside them, and that’s not only for creating games, but in general. It’s just, stop listening to this [points to head] and just feel it instead.</em>"</p>



<p>Fares also discussed how the studio has had incredible commercial successes. Split Fiction <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">sold <strong>4 million copies at launch</strong></a>, and its prior release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two</a>,</strong> sold over <strong><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies as of March 2025</a>.</strong> But those numbers weren't achieved with the studio following trends or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/">put microtransactions into everything.</a> It came from the team at Hazelight keeping what's best for the game at the heart of all its decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>Every decision, every single decision, taken by Hazelight will be based on what we feel is great for the game. We’re not going through data thinking what will sell or not sell. That’s not how we do it. I’m not saying that the business is not important. It’s important to combine them together. If you lean in too much on either side, either too much on creativity or too much on business, it’s going to be bad for the game</em>."</p>



<p>On the topic of following trends, Fares also spared a few words on the hottest topic in the industry, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?wp_searchable_posts%5Bquery%5D=genAI">GenAI</a>. </strong>"<em>We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better</em>. <em>At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?</em>"</p>
