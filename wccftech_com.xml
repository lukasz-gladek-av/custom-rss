			<p>Starfield launch on PlayStation 5 could be imminent, judging from a recent finding that's been making the rounds online today.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1jb6ldu/they_have_added_the_playstation_logo_to_a/"> Starfield subreddit</a>, a new work-in-progress Creation to add decals to the main ship is listed on the <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals/details">Creations website</a> with a PlayStation 5 logo. Heading over to the Detail tab also shows PlayStation console availability for the mod, suggesting that the PS5 logo hasn't been added by mistake and that the game is inching closer to its PlayStation 5 release.</p>

<p>As<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/"> keeping games off of other platforms is not Xbox's path</a>, there's little doubt that Starfield will eventually make the jump to PlayStation 5. The game's PS5 version has been rumored to be in the works for a while and could definitely be part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/">"lots of exciting things"</a> that have been recently teased for the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> launched back in 2023 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and was expanded last year with the Shattered Space DLC. While the expansion's story is among the best available in the game, the DLC leaves something to be desired, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>

			<p>Ubisoft is reportedly considering launching a new venture that will hold some of the company's most popular IPs, and that could be part-owned by other companies besides shareholder Tencent.</p>
<p>According to a new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the French publisher is looking to establish a new entity that will include some of the publisher's biggest IPs, like the Assassin's Creed series, and is considering selling a minority stake in this new venture. Potential bidders, who have already been contacted and asked for preliminary bids before the end of the month, include current Ubisoft shareholder Tencent. Everything, however, is still under consideration, and plans could change, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that Ubisoft is considering<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/"> starting this new venture</a> that would hold some of its most lucrative IPs. Back in January, however, it seemed like only Tencent would be involved in this new venture which would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the publisher.</p>
<p>While it hasn't been said outright, there's little doubt that Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance on the market will have a big impact on Ubisoft's future. The new entry in the series set in Feudal Japan, which is said to be the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">visually advanced entry in the series to date</a>, will launch next week on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
