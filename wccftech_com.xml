			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">the show on December 11, 2025,</a> Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards team revealed the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards, including the games up for the show's most significant award, Game of the Year (though <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tgas-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-have-leaked.1355809/">the nominees for Game of the Year did unfortunately leak ahead of the reveal</a>). </p>



<p>Some years, the nomination count is tight between the few games favourited to win the big Game of the Year prize, with only one or two nominations differentiating them from their closest competition. This is not one of those years, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the runaway leader with 12 nominations total across each of the categories.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that three of those nominations are all for performances by actors in the game, though even removing those three, they're still above the next closest titles, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, which are both tied with seven nominations each.</p>



<p>The next closest game is Hades 2, which earned six nominations, followed by Hollow Knight Silksong with five, Split Fiction with four, and despite making it into the Game of the Year nominees, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 only walked away with three nominations (including GOTY).</p>



<p>It's not the only GOTY nominee with a low nomination count, though, as Donkey Kong Bananza eeked its way into the nominees for GOTY, but only received one other nomination for Best Family Game.</p>



<p>As far as recent releases making the list, two interesting points stand out. One is that Marvel's Deadpool VR was nominated for Best VR/AR Game, though it's not officially out until tomorrow, November 18, 2025. The other is Dispatch, which made its way into the Best Debut Indie list after having just released the final episode of its eight-episode arc on November 12. </p>



<p>Voting is now officially open for The Game Awards 2025, and <a href="https://thegameawards.com/">you can go to the official website to cast your vote</a>. Here's the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yoko Taro, creator of Nier: Automata and one of the most prolific developers currently working in video games today, has, contrary to what many fans believe, been working on several video game projects since the release of Nier: Automata in 2017. We've just not been able to see any of the work he's been doing, because the projects he's been on have been cancelled before they made it to public viewing.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>), Yoko Taro set the story straight on what has become a sort of joke amongst his fans that he's not been working on games in recent years. He clarified that he's worked on several projects, though for reasons he did not or could not specify, they were cancelled before they could see the light of day.</p>



<p>"<em>I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren't you making a new sequel to NeiR' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released</em>."</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate, though unsurprising, reality of the modern video game industry that even a developer like Yoko Taro can be working in the industry for years and have nothing to show for it because the game never made it to launch and most unrevealed projects are locked behind NDA's and mountains of red tape that make it appear to the outside observer that you've been doing nothing for the better part of a decade.</p>



<p>He further clarifies that he doesn't feel negatively about the fact that he's not had a shipped game in years, and instead implies that he'd rather not put anything out if it's not going to be exactly right. "<em>I don't view that as a negative thing</em>," he continued. "<em>I believe that if I'm going to release something weird, I'd be better off not releasing anything at all.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-series-creator-yoko-taro-two-games-unsettling/">that we've had multiple reports</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">recent years regarding projects</a> Yoko Taro is working on. Now, it could be that some of those projects are the cancelled ones to which he refers to here, but regardless, it seems like Yoko Taro felt strongly enough about the idea that he's been sitting on his hands for years that he felt the need to explain why we've not seen anything he's worked on recently.</p>



<p>It seems like we'll just have to continue being patient and hope that at least one of the things he's working on will make it into the hands of players.</p>
