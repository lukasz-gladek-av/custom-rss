			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-need-our-studios-to-believe-they">The Game Business</a> also provides data from Ampere Analysis, which includes player numbers for June's more notable releases like MindsEye, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's launch has been a very public mess, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">players getting refunds on PlayStation</a> over the major technical issues the game has, and developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">Build a Rocket Boy confirming it has begun the process of laying off potentially 100 employees</a>.</p>
<p>According to Ampere Analysis, MindsEye has just under 250K players, with approximately 150K of those players on PlayStation. On Steam, however, the only platform where MindsEye's player creation platform is available, Ampere reports only 35,000 players.</p>
<p>MindsEye currently has the distinction of being the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, and while Build a Rocket Boy has been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mindseyes-second-hotfix-is-now-live-as-its-developer-races-to-fix-its-disastrous-launch/">pushing out hotfixes as fast as it can</a>, it's currently unclear if there is a true path to redemption for the studio's debut game. Especially if what's supposed to be its main source of growth, its user-generated content platform, is playable only to the smallest portion of its player base.</p>
<p>The Game Business also designates FBC: Firebreak as the other game that's struggling at launch, even though its total player base across platforms is approximately 1.3 million players. A little less than 800K players on Xbox, 541K players on PlayStation, and only 54K players on Steam.</p>
<p>For a multiplayer-focused game, those are admittedly not the kinds of numbers developers want or necessarily need to see, and the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus means many of those players also don't equal direct game sales. That said, this is Remedy's first major foray into multiplayer games, and in its <a href="https://x.com/ControlRemedy/status/1938250909093663145">message acknowledging the 1M+ players milestone</a>, the studio stands firm in its commitment to supporting Firebreak.</p>
<p>"<em>We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon,</em>" Remedy writes on X.</p>
<p>The other games mentioned in The Game Business' report are classed as successes for their June launches, including Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">Rematch</a>, and Aggro Crab and Landfall's indie hit, Peak, which <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646">sold over 1 million copies in its first week</a>.</p>
<p>Ampere Analysis's updated player counts for Dune: Awakening have it at over 1.2 million following <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Funcom's report</a>, while Peak has now reached more than 2.2 million players, according to Ampere.</p>
<p>Ampere also reports that most of Rematch's player base is, unsurprisingly, on Xbox due to its availability on Xbox Game Pass, with 1.58 million players. On PlayStation, Rematch sits just under 800K players, while the PC version has reached more than 1.1 million players. When Sloclap is able to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support</a>, it'll be interesting to see how the game grows from its strong start without it.</p>
