			<p>During The Game Awards 2025, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch date of PRAGMATA, its long-awaited new sci-fi intellectual property. Originally unveiled before the debut of the PlayStation 5 console as a 'next-generation' title, the game suffered multiple delays and was at one point thought to be going the way of Deep Down, another CAPCOM IP that vanished into thin air.</p>



<p>However, CAPCOM reintroduced it this year with trailers, hands-on opportunities at conventions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom</a>, and finally, the release date, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rating by the South Korean board</a>. Moreover, the developers also released a free demo called 'Sketchbook' that allows players to try the unique blend of hacking and fighting that makes up the core mechanics.</p>



<p>Firstly, as part of the release date news and demo availability, the developers have shared the official PC system requirements, which are listed below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 (64 bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5‑8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7‑8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>40 GB available space</td><td>40 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Additional Notes</strong></td><td>Estimated performance on “Performance” preset: 1080p/45 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. SSD recommended.</td><td>Estimated performance on “Balanced” preset: 1080p/60 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB required for ray tracing. SSD recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As evidenced by the specs themselves, PRAGMATA does not aim to be the next Crysis. Indeed, CAPCOM themselves admitted <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-gave-pragmata-an-early-steam-demo-to-make-sure-the-full-release-runs-smoothly-across-a-wide-range-of-pcs-we-ask-the-developers-about-their-optimization-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Automaton Media</a> that their priority was to prioritize a solid frame rate 'even if it meant sacrificing certain graphical aspects'. In that conversation, the development team also revealed why PC was the first platform to receive a demo (console demos will be released later): this allows them to gather feedback from gamers and optimize the game across the virtually countless PC configurations that can be created with existing components.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRAGMATA PC 'Sketchbook' Demo 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1iM1DDPK74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Based on my time with the demo, I'd say PRAGMATA, which is powered by the RE Engine like every recent CAPCOM game, already runs very well, at least on a high-end PC. At 4K resolution and every single graphics setting pushed to the max, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLAA (AI-powered anti-aliasing while rendering at native resolution), on an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition GPU, the demo averaged 173 frames per second. That's with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation enabled; there is currently no support for Multi-Frame Generation, so it was set to 2x. AMD users can enable FSR Frame Generation, and for the upscaling component, they can choose between AMD FSR 3.1.4 and AMD FSR 1.</p>



<p>More importantly, FLAT (the Frame Analytics Latency Tool software) registered a very low stuttering 'share' of 3,68%, much lower than most PC games, which range from 8-10%, let alone the worst example so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-performance-test-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with its 20,29% of stuttering time</a>. Indeed, subjectively, the demo felt smooth and almost entirely stutter-free.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PRAGMATA_SKETCHBOOK_DEMO_FLAT-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Now, it also didn't stand out particularly for its visuals. With the game taking place in relatively small interiors, at least based on the demo, perhaps CAPCOM could have delivered more detailed environments and assets as a whole. Still, based on the aforementioned statement, it was not their priority; they wanted to focus on performance instead. The game is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, as announced at The Game Awards 2025, and I can see it performing well even there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, those seeking a stunning game to show off their shiny new graphics card may want to look elsewhere. Granted, PC users will likely be able to inject path tracing through mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as was the case with previous RE Engine games</a>. CAPCOM only natively added ray traced reflections and indirect lighting to this game, whereas Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature native path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>The excellent performance exhibited by the PRAGMATA demo would be even better news if this were a challenging action game akin to Ninja Gaiden 4, to name one. However, this is not that kind of game. It's meant to be a far more relaxed experience, though I personally do hope that CAPCOM adds a Hard difficulty level before launch, as the demo felt far too easy.</p>



<p>Still, I largely enjoyed my experience with the demo and look forward to playing the full game when it launches on April 24, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Sucker Punch Productions, the first-party PlayStation Studios team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">Ghost of Yotei,</a> Ghost of Tsushima, the inFamous series, and the Sly Cooper series, has officially entered into a new era with the departure of Brian Fleming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-will-stick-making-one-game-at-a-time/">one of the studio's co-founders and longtime studio head</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/">a blog post on the official Sony Interactive website</a>, where the company confirmed that Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley will be stepping into new roles as co-studio heads, with Nate Fox staying on as co-creative director to round out the studio's full leadership team.</p>



<p>It's unclear what Fleming has planned next, because it doesn't seem like he knows what that is. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/">In a LinkedIn post from Fleming</a> that followed the official announcement, he began, "<em>So, what do you think I should do next? That's the</em> <em>big question - because after 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe..."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I leave Sucker Punch in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had - Adrian and Jason will do an amazing job as Studio Heads. And the rest of the directors - Nate, Joanna, Billy, Gail, Parker, Sonia, Rob, etc., they are all so capable and so ready for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish,"</em> he continued.</p>



<p>Fleming then confirmed that he hasn't yet seen his last day at Sucker Punch. That'll come in April 2026, as he'll continue to stay at the studio to assist with the transition for Connell and Bentley. Afterwards, he'll take a break and spend some time travelling with his family.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Fleming mentions that he's "<em>trying to sort out which opportunities</em>" he wants to explore, some of which he says are within the industry, "<em>some tech, some entertainment and some advocacy/politics stuff</em>." </p>



<p>Whatever Fleming does next, it'll be worth keeping an eye on. He might not be the creative genius behind everything at Sucker Punch for the last 28 years, but there are few leaders like him in the video game industry who are capable enough to lead a studio to continued strength and growth for over two decades. Sucker Punch has only grown in the eyes of players and PlayStation fans with each new franchise and remains one of the most beloved studios under PlayStation's umbrella.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what he does next, and how Sucker Punch continues without him in its new post-Fleming era.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has been known to 'jump the gun' when it comes to announcing its upcoming titles. Starfield, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-reveal-e3-90-percent-likely-2021-launch/">was a game we knew about for years before it released</a>, and there's an argument to be made that it was to the game's detriment that we knew about it coming for so long. Now, the same could be happening with The Elder Scrolls VI, as Bethesda provided an update on the game's development in a recent interview that essentially amounts to the studio saying nothing more than it's still coming.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">GameInformer</a>, three lead members of Bethesda spoke about how things are going with The Elder Scrolls VI. Studio director Angela Browder, director and executive producer Todd Howard, and studio design director Emil Pagliarulo. </p>



<p>No one dared to suggest a release window of any sort, and all of them said some version of Howard's initial comment, which was that "<em>It's progressing really well</em>." Pagliarulo was perhaps the most blunt and furthest away from marketing-speak, as he said, "<em>I can say that it's going</em>!"</p>



<p>"<em>It's funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don't put on ourselves,</em>" Pagliarulo continued. "<em>And I know that can be frustrating for players who are dying to play a game. Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games they take not just a long time to make, but a long time spit and polish and iron out the bugs. And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That's what I think people are going to want. So, we're going to make our time and as long as it needs to be great</em>."</p>



<p>Howard was much more succinct with his words. After saying that it is "<em>progressing really well</em>," he added, "<em>the majority of the studio's on VI, but I'll say this: we always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We wish it went a little bit faster - or a lot faster - but it's a process that we want to get right</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, Browder added that they are "<em>actively excited about what's in front of us</em>," with how hardware and technology have improved since development on The Elder Scrolls VI first started, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/">a comment that we've seen before regarding the game's protracted development</a>. "<em>The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer</em>," Browder added.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it's good that the developers at Bethesda aren't putting a massive amount of pressure on themselves to try and get The Elder Scrolls VI done as soon as possible. No one does their best work if they're also always trying to think about getting their work done as fast as possible. Sometimes, you really do just need to sit with something and let it take as long as it takes before you end up in a good place.</p>



<p>That said, knowing that doesn't necessarily make the waiting easier for players. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">Even as Howard "<em>preaches patience</em>,"</a> the more the game sits in players minds as nothing but a short teaser that was shown to early, the more volatile its eventual launch will feel, which could be great for the game, or it could have the same impact it did with Starfield, where players are largely unimpressed with what Bethesda spent years toiling away on. </p>
