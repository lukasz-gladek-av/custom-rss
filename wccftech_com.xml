			<p>Today, Krafton unveiled the 2025 roadmap for PUBG: Battlegrounds. A year after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game's transition from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, it finally provided an update on the task.</p>
<p>This is meant to establish a new long-term foundation for the game while retaining the same feeling that fans have appreciated. The UE5 upgrade, though, still needs time in the oven, as it was described as being in the pre-production phase. On the tech front, Krafton is also busy making the long-requested current-generation version of PUBG. This is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X in late 2025, delivering visual improvements as well as a more optimized experience for frame rate and map loading speed.</p>
<p>The developers are also preparing to launch the PUBG UGC (User Generated Content) project. This will allow players to create and share their own custom experiences, starting with a new TDM-style mode in Custom Matches. This initiative is designed to give players greater creative freedom and expand the ways in which they interact with the game.</p>
<p>A more unified experience across Normal Matches, Ranked, and Esports is coming, too, thanks to the integration of key elements from Normal Matches into Ranked, reducing the gameplay gap between the two modes. To further enhance progression, a tier overhaul is planned for June, making rank progression feel more rewarding and meaningful.</p>
<p>Balance patches will be released every two months in 2025 to address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. In addition, a major annual rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage different play styles. Alongside these changes, under-utilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and SMGs will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also in development to further expand the arsenal available to players.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will also be majorly overhauled, making PUBG bots behave more realistically and strategically. AI enemies will react to the shrinking blue zone, take cover more effectively, and even use smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These improvements are designed to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</p>

<p>While a new map won't be coming to the game this year, the developers are preparing a big world update due in late 2025. This update will transform existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while retaining the essence of what players love. Moreover, the Destructible Terrain feature is being introduced in the Taego, Miramar, and Erangel maps.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Krafton continues the fight against cheaters. New detection technologies are being developed to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics. The team is also exploring ways to leverage Windows OS protections to provide an additional layer of security against exploitative software.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are being actively used to detect and counter unauthorized software use in real time, improving PUBG's ability to identify and ban cheaters more effectively. Additional security measures are also in development to better protect player accounts and reduce the risk of account hijacking and unfair play.</p>

			<p>Former Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell has revealed that he's leading the foundation of a brand new PlayStation development team called Dark Outlaw Games. As some of you might remember, Blundell left Treyarch in 2020 after&nbsp;<span>working on the first four Black Ops games. A year later, he&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Deviation Games</span>, with the backing of Sony, albeit in an external capacity. Fast-forward another fifteen months or so and Blundell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-deviation-games-loses-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left Deviation Games</a>, too, not long before the studio closed down.</p>
<p>This time, Dark Outlaw Games is being structured inside PlayStation Studios, as Blundell said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on The Jeff Gerstmann Show</a>:</p>
<p>I<em>'ve had the amazing opportunity to create a new studio within PlayStation Studios for Sony. The studio is called Dark Outlaw Games, and we have been working away in the shadows for a while. When we got something to talk about, we'll step out into the light, but you know the story for me is always about the game, not about the studio. The reason why we're not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, let's get something, right? But yeah, Dark Outlaw Games. It's such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn't set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling; it's really nice. I'm really excited.</em></p>
<p><em>We're keeping it kind of low key. We have been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we're doing exactly, but we're getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking and testing those. You know I'm a programmer at heart, so let's test those assumptions. Is it working? Again, we're trying to hit that escape velocity. But again, being asked to do something like this... I get the studio head and director. I'm just gonna keep that side. I got an executive producer this time. But yeah, it's very exciting, and I love the fact that still, at this point in my career, I'm given these opportunities.&nbsp;It's always that desire to, again, you want to put that one extra disc on the wall if you will. Can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs? That makes me jump out of bed every morning. We'll be working tirelessly to get that ready.</em></p>
<p>Dark Outlaw Games is based in Los Angeles. For the time being, the studio appears to be relatively small, at least judging by LinkedIn. However, it's likely to staff up in the coming years. Given the average triple-A development time, we might have to wait until 2027 or 2028 before we get to see something concrete.</p>
