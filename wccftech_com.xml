			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> is finally live after an unexpected month-long delay, something that, according to <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">won't happen again</a>. The new season went live with the introduction of the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, several new weapons, and the introduction of a new limited-time mode featuring a new gameplay mechanic, <strong>VL-7</strong> hallucinogenic gas.</p>



<p>The new season's arrival has driven the game's highest concurrent player count on Steam so far in February 2026, with the game currently sitting at <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#1m">90,265 players</a></strong> at the time of this writing. If the concurrent count is able to break <strong>100K</strong>, it'll be the first time that's happened for the game in over a month, since the last time it reached above 100K was back on <strong>January 11, 2026.</strong></p>

<p>If you want an overview of everything coming in Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown of the new content in the pipeline here</a>. I also got the chance to spend a couple of hours with some of the new content at a press preview event last week ahead of launch, and you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/">read my impressions of what I played here</a>.</p>



<p>While the introduction of a new map, the new VL-7 Strike limited-time mode, new weapons and vehicles are all welcome additions, as I noted in my preview, what will likely be more welcome by players are the changes to progression pacing with regard to how quickly players can move through the battle pass. </p>



<p>Part of why so many players dropped off from the game after the launch of Season 1 and REDSEC, besides the slow pace at which new content was delivered, was how much of a slog it felt to try and work through the battle pass. Hopefully, these changes (which you can see in the notes below) are able to make working through the rewards for this season more engaging than they were for Season 1.</p>
