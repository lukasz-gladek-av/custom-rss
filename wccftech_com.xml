			<p>The Death Stranding 2: On the Beach release date announcement should be imminent, as information about the game's physical editions, including a pricey Collector's Edition, started surfacing online ahead of pre-orders opening.</p>
<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun revealed in a new<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report</a> that information about the game's physical editions have started surfacing, suggesting that pre-orders are about to begin, and thus a release date announcement is imminent. Besides a standard edition, which will launch for â‚¬79.99 and $69.99, a Collector's Edition will also launch in North America and Europe for the price of $299.99 in the United States. The contents of the Collector's Edition are still unknown at the time.</p>
<p>As the insider estimates pre-orders for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will begin before the end of the month, there's a very good chance that the game's release date will be revealed during this week's special panel at SXSW 2025, which will feature not only Hideo Kojima but also Norman Reedus and Troy Baker who play main character Sam Porter Bridges and villain Higgs, respectively.</p>
<p>Likely being a few months away from the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on PlayStation 5, this would be the perfect time to revisit the first entry in the series and get reacquainted with the series' universe. You can learn more about the game's Director's Cut version, now available on PC and PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">review.</a></p>

			<p>It appears that Respawn Entertainment has quietly canceled another game project. The news was shared via LinkedIn by former Executive Assistant and Production Coordinator&nbsp;Emilee Evans, who wrote (as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/titanfall-developer-respawn-canceled-fps-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by The Game Post):</p>
<p><em>The unannounced incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role.</em></p>
<p>Evans did not specify what kind of project it was, but the studio had been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> people with 'significant professional experience designing Multiplayer FPS experiences' for the Incubation Team, hinting that it would have been a multiplayer first-person shooter game. That's certainly not surprising, considering that the studio built its fortune on that kind of game with Titanfall and later Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We'll probably never know for sure if it was another attempt to make a new Titanfall, though Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-game-reportedly-in-development-at-respawn-though-it-wont-be-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> last year that the studio was indeed developing another game in the franchise. This would be the second time (that we know of) a new franchise installment gets canceled, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-legends-single-player-gamer-canceled-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of the Titanfall Legends single player project</a> in early 2023.</p>
<p>About a year later, Respawn Entertainment's parent company, Electronic Arts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> another game in development at the studio, a multiplayer first-person shooter set in the world of Star Wars. Back then, EA CEO Andrew Wilson highlighted the need to move away from licensed IPs due to the licensing costs. That excuse is certainly not applicable to new Titanfall games, though.</p>
<p>Right now, the Los Angeles based studio is certainly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi franchise. They should also still be publishing an upcoming XCOM-like Star Wars tactics strategy game with Bit Reactor. In June 2024, the developers <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked to PC Gamer</a> about the partnership:</p>
<p><em>Respawn really treats us like an internal team. They've been really good to us. They encourage collaboration and communication between teams. And so they've been just flat out the best experience I've ever had in publishing. They trust us to make the kind of game we know how to make.</em></p>
