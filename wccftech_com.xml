<p>Now, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/"><strong>rumored</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">internal delay into 2026</strong></a>, it seems like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the wait</strong> for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> to land on Sony's current-generation console is reportedly<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> close to an end</strong>.</p>

<p>The imminent release of the game on PlayStation 5 is an interesting happening even for those who already played Starfield on Xbox Series X|S and PC, as this launch is rumored to coincide with the release a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/">massive update</a></strong> which will bring significant improvements to the game, addressing some of the most common complaints, such as <strong>loading screens</strong> that essentially fracture the game's open world, <strong>improved space flight</strong> and more. </p>

            <guid>1426321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly a week after <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping the first 'Features Overview' video dedicated to the open world and story of <strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a>, developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the second entry in the series. The new video dives deep into the action/adventure RPG's combat mechanics and character progression ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong> launch date. The showcase reveals a combat system designed around fluidity, expressiveness, and player choice, combined with progression paths that, according to the developers, will reward exploration and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>At the heart of Crimson Desert's combat are weapon variety and seamless skill chaining</strong>. Players can wield an arsenal of weapons, ranging from classic swords and shields to spears, greatswords, axes, and ranged weapons, each offering distinct tactical advantages. Pearl Abyss highlighted that <strong>attacks will flow naturally between weapon strikes, bare-hand combat, kicks, and grapples</strong>, allowing players to build highly customizable combo chains. Elemental enhancements such as burn, freeze, and stun effects further deepen the tactical layer, giving the player tools to adapt to different enemy types and situations.</p>



<p>The developers took great care to ensure mobility played a crucial role in maintaining combat momentum. Slides, dodges, counters, and swings are directly integrated into attack sequences, creating what Pearl Abyss describes as <strong>"combat that feels grounded yet explosive and endlessly expressive."</strong> Perfectly timed guards and dodges don't just protect—they open counter windows that keep players on the offensive. The system rewards skillful timing and positioning over button mashing, encouraging players to master the rhythm of each encounter. Beyond direct combat, the game also features environmental and mount-based combat. <strong>Players can leverage their surroundings and utilize various mounts to shift battlefield dynamics</strong>.</p>



<p>The progression journey begins with protagonist Kliff at his lowest point. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As mentioned in our game info roundup article</a></strong>, he's a survivor of the Black Bears' devastating assault on the Greymanes with minimal abilities and equipment at his disposal. <strong>Players must gradually rebuild Kliff into a formidable warrior</strong>, with every advancement shaped by player-driven choices.</p>



<p>Central to the character progression in Crimson Desert is the <strong>Artifact System</strong>, where <strong>Abyss fragments collected from quests, boss victories, and exploration unlock core stat boosts like Health and Stamina increases</strong>. These fragments also grant new skills that extend combo chains and enhance existing abilities. In a nice twist, some advanced techniques require players to observe them firsthand in the world before they can be learned.</p>



<p>Each player will most likely build a different version of Kliff. They might prioritize stamina upgrades to enable longer exploration sessions and extended gliding across Pywel's vast regions, or they could focus on unlocking diverse grappling techniques to dominate melee combat. <strong>The skill combination system and upgrade paths are designed to reflect individual playstyles, ensuring no two players' Kliff will develop identically</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The video then mentioned that equipment crafting and customization offer another layer of progression. Gear can be purchased from merchants, discovered in hidden locations, or crafted from raw materials gathered through mining, hunting, and quest completion. <strong>Boss encounters in particular will serve as both tests of mastery and sources of unique rewards</strong>. Fearsome adversaries ranging from human opponents to beasts, mechanical constructs, and magical entities await throughout the continent. <strong>Defeating these bosses yields exclusive equipment imbued with their signature abilities and special effects</strong>. Before closing the video, Pearl Abyss teased a third and final Features Overview coming ahead of the game's launch. If it follows the current schedule, it should drop on Thursday, February 12.</p>



<p>In other Crimson Desert news, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just surpassed two million wishlists</a></strong>. Pearl Abyss PR Director Will Powers also recently shared a couple of tidbits about the game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main campaign is only a small percentage of the overall content available</a>, and the balance between narrative and gameplay sits in the middle between <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>.</p>
