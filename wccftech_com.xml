			<p>A new NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution comparison video further highlights the significant image quality improvements the new Transformer model brings in popular games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Following the release of the video highlighting the significant image quality improvements brought by the new Transformer model in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shared another comparison video showcasing the image quality improvements the new model brings in Red Dead Redemption 2 and STALKER 2. In the Rockstar Games open-world title, the biggest change is in vegetation quality, as the new model significantly decreases the shimmering in vegetation over the previous version of the upscaler using the CNN model. Hair rendering is also improved with better stability and less aliasing. In GSC World's game, on the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS 4 using the Transformer model improves image stability considerably and reduces vegetation shimmering like in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution in 5 Games - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dwv2jaa5yPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Transformer model isn't the only new thing NVIDIA DLSS 4 brings to the table. Multi Frame Generation, which will be exclusive to RTX 50 series cards, will deliver an up to 8x performance boost versus DLSS 3, making it possible to enjoy games with full path tracing at high framerates and resolutions. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, can run with Overdrive Mode path tracing at above 120 FPS at 4K resolution on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">RTX 5080</a>, which is extremely impressive, considering how taxing path tracing is in pretty much every game that supports it.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 will make its official debut next week, on January 30th, when it will become possible to use a new Override feature to update to the latest version of the upscaler with any game that already supports previous versions.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad is leaving the company. The news <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was broken by Variety</a> and confirmed by the publisher, which shared the following statement from WB Global Streaming CEO JB Perrette:</p>
<p><em>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title.</em></p>
<p>Haddad himself also provided a statement on his departure from the company after nearly ten years in the role and over twenty in total at WB Games:</p>
<p><em>I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is that the recent failures of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus might have played a role. The former game by Rocksteady was a massive disappointment that <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a major financial drop in revenue for the publisher after a big investment. The latter certainly cost a lot less to make, but it still ultimately underperformed despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-surpassed-20-million-players-in-less-than-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial success seen in the Open Beta a couple of years ago</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's also worth remembering that Warner Bros. Games smashed sales records just a couple of years ago with Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a> in a year filled with triple-A releases. A sequel is already in production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might have live service elements</a>; in the meantime, rumors suggest a sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> is being made with the help of Rocksteady.</p>
