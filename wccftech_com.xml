			<p>A Fallout New Vegas RTX Remix mod is now in development, aiming to introduce path tracing to one of the most loved entries in the series.</p>



<p>The mod is currently in development by skurtyyskirts, who has provided an overview of what it will feature and a very early look at it. Besides introducing path tracing, which already brings significant improvements in indoor locations but significantly impacts the original atmosphere in outdoor locations, the mod will also introduce new textures that will work better with path tracing. You can take a look at this very early version of the mod below.</p>

<p>Despite having been released 15 years ago, Fallout New Vegas continues to enjoy immense popularity, and it is regarded as one of the finest entries in the post-apocalyptic RPG series. Despite its reputation among fans of the series, the game developed by Obsidian Entertainment never received a sequel, although it is rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/">New Vegas 2 could be a thing in the future,</a> something that may have been facilitated by the fact that Microsoft now owns both Bethesda and Obsidian Entertainment. Sadly, it's been over three years since we heard some rumblings about this potential sequel, so the current status of a game that many would be happy to know it's in development is unknown.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hitman World of Assassination may have revealed some new details on the system, including a possible hidden system feature.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series developed by IO Interactive after having been informed that the game seemingly runs better when lowering the system's resolution. After conducting some tests, the tech experts confirmed that Hitman World of Assassination indeed changes resolution when the system resolution is changed via the system menu, allowing users to enable some sort of Performance Mode by lowering the resolution to 720p. In the GPU-limited Whittleton Creek area, the game is 62.5% faster at 720p, 9.7% faster at 1080p resolution than in 4K resolution, and in the Berlin area, which is similarly GPU-bound, the performance differentials are very similar - 61% faster at 720p, 7% faster at 1080p.</p>



<p>While the discovery of this hidden Performance Mode is quite interesting by itself, there are a few other things that make this unique Hitman World of Assassination feature notable. For starters, the performance difference between 1080p and 4K resolution can only be explained if 4K resolution uses NVIDIA DLSS to upscale the image from a lower resolution, and the around 10% performance difference discovered during testing could very well be the performance cost of upscaling with DLSS from 1080p to 4K resolution. Even more interesting is the fact that the game instantly changes the resolution when the system resolution is changed, which could be a hidden Nintendo Switch 2 system feature,  as the tech experts noted how IO Interactive could have made these display modes options available via an in-game menu if they wished to have them in the game.</p>

<p>Being the first handheld device that uses NVIDIA DLSS, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a very interesting system from a technical standpoint, but each new discovery is making it even more interesting as users delve deeper into what it offers.

			<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-rejects-sony-settlement-over-playstation-game-sales-2025-07-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Reuters</a>, a United States District Court judge from the Northern District of California has rejected a Sony-approved settlement over a PlayStation credits class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that Sony overcharged for digital games distributed through its monopolized PlayStation Store, and Sony agreed to settle the lawsuit by allocating $7.8 million in PlayStation credits to millions of PlayStation Network users.</p>



<p>However, the judge denied the settlement for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 'coupon settlements' such as this one are 'generally disfavored'.</p>



<p><em>The motion fails to include an estimated recovery had the proposed class prevailed on each claim, and it fails to provide any estimate of the discount applied to the claims. Importantly, though the motion acknowledges the potential damages were smaller than initially contemplated, the motion provides no estimated class recovery given that discovery. These shortcomings alone warrant denial of Cendejas’s motion for preliminary approval because it prevents the Court from meaningfully assessing the fairness of the proposed settlement. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must include a chart setting forth the anticipated breakdown of the $7,850,000 settlement distribution, including amounts estimated for attorney’s fees, service awards, costs, administration expenses, and other amounts to be paid. From the resulting net settlement amount, Cendejas shall provide a ballpark estimate or range of amounts to be distributed to each Settlement Class Member. </em></p>



<p><em>Moreover, the Settlement calls for Class Members to receive compensation in the form of cash-value PlayStation Network (“PSN”) account credits. The Court views such PSN account credits as settlement coupons, which are generally disfavored. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must address the propriety of such settlement coupons and whether the value and structure of this settlement remain defensible.</em></p>



<p>For its part, Sony had actually denied any wrongdoing, but added that it was settling to avoid the further expense and distraction of continued litigation. Following this ruling, it remains unclear whether users will actually see those PlayStation credits or not.</p>



<p>A similar lawsuit was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in the United Kingdom</a>, although the plaintiffs are asking for compensation orders of magnitude greater than the US one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest for the Wicked Might Initially Skip Xbox Because of ‘Market Conditions’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox-because-of-%E2%80%98market-conditions%E2%80%99.1249401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The top-down action RPG No Rest for the Wicked could skip Xbox, at least at first, as suggested by Moon Studios founder and Game Director Thomas Mahler. While chatting in the game's official Discord channel, he <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>By the way, given current market conditions, we might only release on PlayStation 5 and potentially Nintendo Switch 2 for the time being. We'll have to discuss things with Microsoft to see what makes sense for Xbox.</em></p>



<p>Later, Mahler commented on X that it's not official yet, but supporting PlayStation 5 first and foremost is just common business sense at this point.</p>



<p><em>There’s nothing to officially confirm yet. We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately, we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!</em></p>



<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in the second half of April 2024 on PC as an early access title. At first, it was published by Private Division, but Moon Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased</a> the publishing rights back earlier this year.</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the Austrian developer (primarily known for the Ori franchise) wasn't exactly doing very well, with Mahler asking fans to leave a positive review on Steam for No Rest for the Wicked to counterbalance some review bombing. That may be why they are prioritizing the most lucrative platforms for the console ports.</p>



<p>Indeed, Xbox doesn't have nearly as large a user base as the PlayStation 5 (or the Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, if it continues selling at this rate). The hardware sales of Microsoft's consoles have continued dwindling as the first-party games are now available not only on PC but even on other consoles, and third-party developers find it increasingly hard to spend resources on Xbox versions, unless there is a Game Pass deal involved - which is not the case so far with No Rest for the Wicked.</p>



<p>It is, however, ironic that a developer whose best-known franchise, Ori, made its fortune on Xbox, is now essentially forced to put the platform after others.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fable Rumored to Be Missing 2026 Launch Window, Too]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fable-rumored-to-be-missing-2026-launch-window-too.1249374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In late February, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to fans that Fable would be missing its 2025 launch window. He did so while reassuring them with a new, gorgeous Pre-Alpha gameplay video that promised everything was in order except for the additional polish required before shipping the game.</p>



<p>However, according to insider Shpeshal Nick, there's a chance Fable might miss 2026, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gB3q8GursaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast</a>, he relayed information from two sources that suggested a delay is not out of the question:</p>



<p><em>I don't think Fable's next year. My information is that it's not going to be 2026. I've heard it from two different people now that Fable may slip to 2027. And that's not doom and gloom, oh, there's something wrong with the game. Problems. Just hearing that it's taking a little bit longer than they expected.<br>It's not about agreeing or disagreeing, I've had two different people tell me. One of them wasn't from Microsoft. I'm hearing that it's probably going to slip to 2027. Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware of what will probably happen now. Someone from Playground will probably come out and go, "No, no, it's next year."</em></p>



<p>While Shpeshal Nick got a few Xbox rumors right before, he doesn't exactly have a spotless record, either. As such, take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>If it turned out to be the case, though, it would be another blow to Microsoft's reputation. Fans are already disgruntled after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot and the ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG, not to mention the related layoffs. Moreover, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the twenty-fifth anniversary of Xbox, due to take place next year, would be celebrated with the return of several historic franchises, including Fable, Forza, Gears of War, and another that might be Halo.</p>



<p>Going back on that promise wouldn't work in Microsoft's favor. At the same time, rushing a game that is not ready wouldn't be great, either. But Playground Games has reportedly been working on the game for around eight years now, and while it is understandable that it would take them a while to get a grip on the action RPG genre (they only ever did racing games before), making that a full ten years to 2027 would be too much. They even got help from Eidos Montréal, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2024, although a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> from the Canadian studio suggests their part of the work on Fable might have been completed.</p>



<p>Even without Fable, Microsoft could still have a decent first-party lineup in 2026 between Clockwork Revolution, the new Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Halo: Combat Evolved remake</a>, not to mention what Bethesda and Activision Blizzard may have in store for next year. Even so, it would be another blow for the Xbox division in the eyes of fans.</p>



<p>We'll update this story if anyone from Playground Games and/or Microsoft wishes to comment on the rumor.</p>
