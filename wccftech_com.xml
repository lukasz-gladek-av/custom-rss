			<p>This year saw a lot of majorly successful games on Steam, with the best sellers being revealed based on total gross revenue earned in 2024. Although these are the top-selling games, the revenue for the titles hasn't been revealed, and they are separated into categories. If you want to see what games are in each category, you can check out the official list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/bestof2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a>. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platinum: 1st-12th</li>
<li>Gold 13th-24th</li>
<li>Silver 25th-50th</li>
<li>Bronze 51st-100th</li>
</ul>
<p>As there are a lot of games, we won't be discussing every single one that has made it onto the top charts. There are also sub-categories into which the games are organized. On the Steam page, you'll see there are categories for Top Sellers, New Releases, Most Played, Steam Deck, Controller, and VR. This allows you to see what statistics they are measured by, which includes top concurrent players as well as top-grossing revenue for the year.</p>
<p>In the platinum category for top-grossing revenue, live-service games like Apex Legends and Counter-Strike 2 continue to be on top, alongside games like PUBG Battlegrounds and Destiny 2. When it comes to premium titles, it's no surprise that award-winning titles like Black Myth: Wukong, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring are on the list. This year saw Black Myth: Wukong win <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">multiple awards</a> at various ceremonies, with Shadow of the Erdtree raking in a couple, too. Despite being released last year, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be majorly successful, and Larian Studios is dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">providing consistent updates</a> and new content for players to dive into.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the New Releases category, titles like Path of Exile II, Heldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and, of course, Black Myth: Wukong are all in the platinum category. When it comes to how they decide which games go into the platinum category, they look at the first two weeks of the game's revenue after its released, and that is the deciding factor as to which game is best-selling and is deserving of being in the platinum category.</p>
<p>When it comes to peak concurrent players, most of the games are live-service titles that have been out for a while. Specifically, the top-played games with over 450,000 peak players are in the category, which consists of games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, and the newly released title Marvel Rivals. However, there are some premium games on there, such as Helldivers 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Elden Ring.</p>
<p>While 2024 has felt like a bit of a quieter year for gaming, there have been some majorly successful releases, with some of them going on to win multiple awards.</p>
<p>What has been your top game of 2024?</p>
