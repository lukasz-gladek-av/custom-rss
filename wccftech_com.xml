			<p>Nintendo kicked off today with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg&amp;t=2221s">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct</a> presentation, which showcased a bunch of new gameplay details about the upcoming adventure, but perhaps most importantly, revealed that the Odd Rock character we met when the game was first revealed back in April, isn't a rock at all - it's Pauline.</p>
<p>It's not the Pauline we know from Super Mario Odyssey, though—it's Pauline as a young child, with dreams of becoming a singer. Before that can happen, however, she needs to make it back to the surface. Stopping Void Kong and his crew from reaching the planet's core and getting Pauline back to the surface seems to be the driving narrative force in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?start=2221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased how Pauline and DK will work together, with DK using his strength to pound, grab, smash, and throw nearly everything around him, using the game's environmental destruction core gameplay concept to carve new paths, and create new paths by reassembling bits of the environment in some cases.</p>
<p>While Pauline uses her voice to manipulate the environment to solve puzzles, and with the help of Giant Elders teaching Pauline and DK their Bananza-powers, Pauline can transform DK into three new forms. The first transformation is Kong Bananza, which makes DK a bigger, stronger gorilla, capable of smashing parts of the world that normal-sized DK can't, and if you can believe it, causing even more chaos.</p>
<p>The other two transformations are Zebra and Ostrich Bananza. When DK transforms into his Zebra form, he's much faster, can run along water, and run across platforms that would otherwise crumble under normal DK, who wouldn't be fast enough to make it across without falling.</p>
<p>Ostrich Bananza gives DK the ability to fly, reaching heights DK otherwise wouldn't be able to reach, and drop egg bombs on enemies as you take to the skies.&nbsp;You can swap between each transformation, and activate them whenever you like, so long as you have a full Bananergy-meter, an energy meter you fill by collecting gold.</p>

<p>We also got a look at a few of the collectibles players will search for, like Banandium Gems, which can also be collected in smaller Banandium Chips form. There's also gold, collectible fossils, and challenge courses to find to earn more Banandium Gems, which can in turn become skill points, which was another major gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>DK has plenty of abilities players can take advantage of, whether that's smashing the environment, using chunks of the world to surf along the ground or on water, or double-jump, and they can all be upgraded through earning and spending skill points.</p>
<p>Pauline is also a playable character in Donkey Kong Bananza's two-player co-op mode, though it doesn't look like she's capable of getting off DK's back. All she can do is send vocal blasts out to various parts of the environment, helping DK out in puzzle solving and combat.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza also supports game share with other Nintendo Switch devices, which means that you can play the co-op mode with a friend, even if that person doesn't have their own copy of Donkey Kong Bananza. Game share works with Switch 2 devices locally or over online play, though it seems to only work with Switch 1 consoles through local game sharing.</p>
<p>The full direct was nearly 18 minutes, and in that time Nintendo showed off a lot about Donkey Kong Bananza, including plenty more depth than the game's first previews showcased.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch previewed the game</a>, he wrote, "<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>This direct made it clear that there's plenty of potential in DK's abilities, and it'll be interesting to see in the full game how far Nintendo takes them all. In the meantime, we await that full release on July 17, 2025.</p>

			<p>A Data Link Between Worlds. That’s what I went away with after my brief 30-minute hands-on session with Bandai Namco’s upcoming monster-taming JRPG, Digimon Story: Time Stranger. Despite only dabbling with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review/">Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</a> on the PlayStation Vita, Bandai Namco assured me that Time Stranger would be just as standalone as other titles in the franchise.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Central-Town-Introduction_EN_1-1456x819.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The art and character designs were among the first things I picked up when diving into Digimon Story: Time Stranger. With Suzuhito Yasuda returning as the character designer, the animated portraits and character profiles look like the highest definition versions of some of his previous works with Bandai Namco. The character models stand out among the muted colors of the digital realm, giving this JRPG a distinctive charm. Symbol encounters make their debut, with enemy Digimon being visible on the field to help pick and choose your fights rather than being at the mercy of random encounters.</p>
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger’s narrative focuses on the twin worlds of real-world Japan (Shinjuku and Akihabara, primarily) and the digital realm that the Digimon call their home, some eight years in the past. While my brief demo only focused on the latter, Bandai Namco hinted that it would be possible to go back and forth between the two as the story progresses. Whether there are be any time hijinx and events taking place in the past cascading into the future, and vice versa, is a mystery they’d like to leave until release. One of Digimon Story: Time Stranger's recent story trailers centered around a citywide explosion at the beginning of the story, leading to the player getting transported into the digital realm, so surely there must be something worth going back to.</p>

<p>Each Digimon offshoot brings a different gameplay style altogether. Those who played the most recent Digimon Survive would remember that entry for its visual novel storytelling and strategic grid-based battles. Here, Digimon Story: Time Stranger takes after the earlier Digimon Story titles with your typical party- and turn-based encounters. With players bringing in four Digimon at a time in addition to guest characters, there’s a lot to juggle in combat, but thankfully, the Digimon themselves are streamlined, at least in one way. Digimon have a few available skills to pick from, at least in the introductory hours of the game. Most are inline with attacking with the given element of that particular monster, while others come with buffing and debuffing skills to turn the tide of battle. Digimon can also use an item before taking action, freeing up a command that might otherwise be spent recovering health after a vicious boss attack.</p>
<p>With nearly a dozen different elements and seven attributes (Bandai Namco only showed off Data, Vaccine, and Virus, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Free and perhaps Variable making a return), there are a lot of variables to consider when testing an attack's effectiveness. Enemy affinities remain a mystery until attacked with a particular element, upon which it shows off whether the attack is only partially effective or upwards of 250-300% effective, depending on if you’re targeting both the enemy’s weakest element and attributes.</p>
<p>With over 450 digital monsters in the roster, there’s going to be plenty for new and returning players to discover for the first time. Part of the charm of Digimon is its non-linear evolution chains, so two players can play through Digimon Story: Time Stranger and come out with vastly different party compositions.</p>
