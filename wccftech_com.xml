            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Co-founder of CD Projekt RED and of Good Old Games (GOG), Michał Kiciński, has just acquired the digital storefront from CD Projekt RED. Kiciński, CDPR, and GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/">announced the news today in a blog post on the official GOG Blog</a>, as Kiciński promises to keep the founding values of GOG at the forefront of how the store operates.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control," </em>Kiciński said. That was the bedrock of the store when Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński founded the store over a decade ago, and that seems to be the same mission statement that is carrying the platform into this new era, as control returns to one of the platform's original co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG is entering a new chapter. Michał Kiciński</em>, <em>co-founder of CD Projekt and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD Projekt</em>," the platform announced on its <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever. Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library you control rather than one that controls you, and offering the most gamer-friendly policies on the market.</em>" </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the blog post, an FAQ outlines how players don't have to do or change anything about their account, and that there is essentially no change for them on the user side. "<em>DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever</em>," the blog post reads, and the platform will also maintain its strong relationship with CD Projekt RED and continue to release CDPR games on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform also clarified that it is not in a bad way financially, and for the platform, this move is more about keeping the platform's core values at the forefront and protecting the platform through this independence.</p>



<p>"<em>To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Altogether, while this acquisition still has a great deal of significance in the fact that one of the more popular digital storefronts for PC players is changing hands, it doesn't feel like a major change at all, considering who it is going to and what will change about the platform going forward. GOG will remain the best place to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">grab older titles through its preservation efforts</a>, to find <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">premium mods like Fallout: London</a>, and the place <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/">where games like Horses can thrive on</a> while other platforms ban it from sale.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BetterVR Mod Lets You Experience Breath of the Wild in VR, And You Should Grab It Before Nintendo Tries to Kill It]]></title>

            <guid>1393858</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five years ago, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a developer known as Crementif started to work on a VR mod so they could cut down trees in the <strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. After they figured out how to cut down trees in VR in Breath of the Wild, they kept working on it, and that initial idea became <strong>BetterVR</strong>, a full VR mod for Breath of the Wild that will let you experience the expansive world of Hyrule for the first time all over again. Until Nintendo tries to kill it, that is.</p>



<p>A trailer for the mod was released by Crementif and Flat2VR Studios just two days prior to its release today, announcing the mod and showcasing just how impressive it is - and it is incredibly impressive. The mod <a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR">is currently available to download</a>, and it works with a copy of Breath of the Wild for the Wii U that has been emulated and can run on your PC through Cemu version 2.6.</p>



<p>Though, as comments on the trailer and everywhere else Crementif's story has been shared point out, you'll want to get your hands on this mod and get it set up before Nintendo tries to kill it with their legal team. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Zelda BOTW VR Mod Trailer - Releasing In 2 Days!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDuxoo0kNsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo's litigious history is well known, whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">it is striking down entire emulators</a>, mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/">for games like Breath of the Wild</a>, or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-patent-on-summoning-and-battling-characters-re-examination-by-us-patent-office/">stretch the meaning of a patent to take out major competitors in the industry</a>. It wouldn't be a surprise if Flat2VR Studios and Crementif were contacted by Nintendo soon, if they haven't already.</p>



<p>Of course, Nintendo will not necessarily go after this mod over the scores of mods available for Breath of the Wild - <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-modded-ray-tracing/">like this one that adds ray tracing and makes the eight-year-old game look brand new</a> -  it's just something that's always a concern when projects like this pop up. So, in the meantime, if you have the necessary hardware and know-how to set this mod up for yourself, you'd do well to get it downloaded and ready, just in case something happens to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Have Until 2030 to Build a Cyberpunk 2-Ready PC, Polish Analysts Predicts a Late 2030 Release for CDPR’s Estimated $419M Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-cd-projekt-red-2030-polish-firm-predicts/</link>
            <guid>1393786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>

			<p>Other years, it's a quiet period for Strategy and Simulation games, making it difficult to even put together a selection of the best games from the genre. Thankfully, that's not the case with 2025, as there were some excellent strategy and simulation games released this year.</p>



<p>Some of those releases even came from the most popular franchises in the strategy and simulation gaming genre. With that said, here are our picks for the Best Strategy and Simulation Games in 2025. Also, make sure to vote for your pick at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-10-10">Two Point Museum (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/">10/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tpm_tp-website_bg-image_3840x2160.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum. Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Two Point series of simulation and management games has always been about creating fun and engaging environments for players to enjoy. It's not about testing your management skills to the brink or making you stress over how your colony (or in this case, museum) is operating. It's about leaning into chaos and comedic moments that make these games enjoyable.</p>



<p>Two Point Museum is a masterclass of a Two Point game, as it strikes all of those points perfectly without missing a beat. It is a bright, accessible management game that will keep you engaged all through its campaign and even further beyond that with its sandbox mode. It's a wonderful accomplishment and easily one of the year's best strategy and simulation games.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's review puts it, "<em>There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-9-5-10">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-the-Ivalice-Chronicles.png"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles. Image credit: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is a return of a classic strategy game that fans have been dying for, and it absolutely did not disappoint when it arrived this past September. With the original Final Fantasy Tactics being known as one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series, and one of the best strategic role-playing games ever made, there was a lot of nostalgic weight on its shoulders <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">when it was finally announced</a>.</p>



<p>It kept the story that players loved and gave it a boost with the Enhanced version, adding some solid voice acting with only a few minor changes to the script, though if it's not to your liking, you can always jump back to Classic mode to play nearly the exact same game you would have played back in 1998. Of course, you miss out on the quality of life improvements made in the Enhanced version, but it's the fact that you have the option for both that really matters when it comes to a game so beloved as this.</p>



<p>The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't try to fix what isn't broken with the game's already excellent gameplay and Job system, and on the Enhanced version, lets you dive even deeper than was previously possible, with a bit of added difficulty, while still staying true to a core feature of the original: you can still break the game wide open if you can figure out how.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo put it in his review, "<em>Decades after its original release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles remains the golden standard for tactical role-playing games. Refined with excellent quality-of-life improvements that enhance its already deep gameplay and superb voice acting, the War of the Lions’ story and battles have never felt more engaging. While the modest visual overhaul and missing War of the Lions content may disappoint those seeking a true definitive edition, they are minor issues in an otherwise excellent reimagining.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sid-meier-s-civilization-vii-8-10">Sid Meier's Civilization VII (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Civilization VII. Image credit: 2K</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the arrival of Civilization VII has been a long time coming. Not as long, of course, seeing as how the last Civilization game arrived in 2016, but nearly a decade between releases is still a long time to wait, especially if you weren't enamoured with the DLCs that came after the full release.</p>



<p>Which is what made the arrival of Civilization VII such an event, and such a divisive one at that. Not everyone has loved the changes made in the latest entry in what is arguably the most popular (or at least well-known) 4X strategy game in the industry. At the time of this writing, it still has a "Mixed" rating for user reviews on Steam. That said, it doesn't fall so far that it's not a good Civilization game, and to still be a good game in a series of filled with excellent games means Civilization is an easy entry in our best strategy and simulation games of the year.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray put it in his review, "<em>Civilization VII is a great game, that's the simple answer. With an improved city-building system, terrain features, and diplomacy, there is much to like in the new release of the three-and-a-half decade old franchise. However, long-time fans of the series will find some of the omissions, such as the ability to turn off victory conditions other than domination, limiting. This, and the rapid nature of the ages, will also leave some feeling that the epic nature of some longer games is altogether missing. Still, even with the games feeling a little rushed, the one-more-turn that makes Civilization one of the best series ever remains there.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tempest-rising">Tempest Rising</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tempest-Rising.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tempest Rising. Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tempest Rising might just be Command &amp; Conquer with a bit of different paint, but that's not really something worth complaining about when Command &amp; Conquer is nowhere to be seen. Developer Slipgate Ironworks saw a gap in the RTS world, and while it didn't fill it entirely with everything Tempest Rising does, it went far enough to scratch the itch for C&amp;C fans that hasn't been scratched for a long time.</p>



<p>Though its multiplayer didn't launch with a lot of fanfare, and its story mode isn't able to reach some of the C&amp;C iconic highs of the series, Tempest Rising doesn't try to fix a system that isn't broken and still delivers the fast-paced RTS gameplay that kept C&amp;C fans engaged for over three decades. </p>



<p>It's more than a good time for RTS fans and a can-not-miss game for anyone still waiting for a new C&amp;C.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mount-and-Blade-II-Bannerlord-War-Sails-Interview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails. Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord had already established itself as one of the premier cinematic options for medieval gameplay and warfare simulation and strategy, with a solid campaign and a wonderfully built world since its 1.0 release in 2022. Now, five years after its initial release, TaleWorlds Entertainment has expanded on the game with its largest and most significant update yet, a naval expansion.</p>



<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the addition of War Sails changed the game for Mount &amp; Blade II. On top of changes to the map and to the layout of Caladria, adding a new battlefield that also adds new trade routes and ways for players to expand their empire has made an already strong game an even more complete offering.</p>



<p>As I said in my impressions of the expansion and the game when it arrived, "<em>War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers.</em>"</p>
