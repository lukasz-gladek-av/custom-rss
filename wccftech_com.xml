			<p>Here's something I really wasn't expecting to write about: YouTuber and modder InfernoPlus has successfully ported The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine.</p>



<p>Originally, InfernoPlus had planned to port Morrowind to Dark Souls 1, then shifting to Dark Souls 3 and eventually to Elden Ring. Not only is FromSoftware's latest game a better title in every regard, including fidelity and gameplay, but its (entirely unofficial and user-made) modding tools have also greatly matured to the extent of making even such a gargantuan undertaking possible.</p>



<p>InfernoPlus said he has been working on the project for quite a while and is now roughly halfway done, but also admitted it's hard to say with any accuracy at this point. The modder said world generation is finished, and lighting and world effects are nearly there, although some lighting processing is still needed.</p>



<p>Interiors are also basically finished, while dialogue generation still must have its scripting data loaded. Voice acting will be added toward the end of the mod's development. However, NPCs, be they animals or humanoids, still have to be properly converted: right now, they're either Elden Ring's default girl (for humanoids) and goats (for animals).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the video, InfernoPlus also touches on the inevitable copyright question, stating that the project cannot possibly violate any laws, as it does not include any Morrowind data. It requires the user to have that Morrowind data installed with a legitimate copy of the game, similar to A Tale of Two Wastelands, which combines Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in a single game while requiring both games. This Morrowind port to the Elden Ring engine is also open source, by the way.</p>



<p>The modder then requested the community's help to keep going. InfernoPlus has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/infernoplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon page</a> where fans can support his work, but beyond that, the project could also use more expertise in certain areas. Between this and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skywind</a>, Morrowind fans have two total conversion mods to look forward to. There's also the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morro RTX mod</a> that aims to take the original game and significantly boost its visuals with the help of NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod is, however, still in its infancy.</p>

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launched a few days ago on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Developed by Virtuos, the remake of MGS3 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 but lacks a few features that PC gamers have come to expect lately.</p>



<p>For example, the game uses Software Lumen for global illumination, but there's a way to enable Ray Traced Lumen for better visual results, albeit at a performance cost. YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8w8pkeaw4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided the guide</a> on how to:</p>



<p><em>Go to AppData\Local\MGSDelta\Saved\Config\Windows and open the Engine.ini file. Then, add the following commands to the bottom of the Engine.ini file:<br>[SystemSettings]<br>r.Lumen.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.ScreenProbeGather.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.LumenScene.DirectLighting.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTrace=0.6<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTraceForFoliage=0.6</em></p>



<p>For even better ray tracing fidelity, Ray Reconstruction can be enabled with:</p>



<p><em>r.NGX.DLSS.denoisermode=1</em></p>



<p>To get NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation, add these commands:</p>



<p><em>r.Streamline.DLSSG.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Mode=1</em></p>



<ol></ol>

</p></figure>



<p>It is indeed a bit weird that all these commands just work in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and yet there is no way to enable them through regular settings. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game does take a slight hit (around five to six frames per second on an RTX 5080) when enabling Hardware RT Lumen, though DLSS Frame Generation more than makes up for it. With DLSS set to Performance, the RTX 5080 used in the test runs around 105 FPS. Of course, having access to Multi Frame Generation would accelerate performance even further. It is likely modders will find a way to get it working soon. By the way, you will need the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-mod-critical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frame rate unlock mod</a>, as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is by default locked to 60 FPS on PC.</p>



<p>Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our PS5 review</a> to find out what Kai Tatsumoto thought about this remake:</p>



<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the de facto perfect way to experience the rise and fall of Big Boss. Each detail has been meticulously refined and brought to modern standards while leaving nothing behind in the past. While this also means retaining both the campiness and jank, there’s no better way to experience the first Metal Gear Solid title in the timeline.</em></p>
