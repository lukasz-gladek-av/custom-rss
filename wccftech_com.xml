			<p>It's been a couple of years since Crate Entertainment announced Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn, a new expansion coming to the hack-and-slash action RPG. Back then, the US-based studio estimated a launch in 2024, which clearly didn't happen.</p>
<p>Now, the developers have <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/fangs-of-asterkarn-development-update-june-2025/146114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update. The game has a chance of launching late this year, but Crate admitted it could be delayed to Spring or even early Summer 2026. In their partial defense, the developers noted that Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn will be by far the biggest expansion for the game, dwarfing <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-ashes-of-malmouth-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashes of Malmouth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-forgotten-gods-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgotten Gods</a>:</p>
<p><em>To put things in perspective, by our current estimations, Fangs of Asterkarn will cover approximately 3.55sq. km, which makes it roughly 110% as big as Ashes of Malmouth. Kurnhold, the de-facto capital of the Kurn and the new quest hub, spans 4 zones, compared to the 1.5 that the Covenant of the Three took up in Forgotten Gods.</em></p>
<p><em>In all that world, there are, as of this writing, currently 47 main/side quests, and that number will likely continue to grow as we flesh out the content. Scattered across Asterkarn are 54 new bosses, including 8 new Nemesis encounters. Mechanically, these bosses will feature some of the most advanced skill tech Grim Dawn has had yet as we continue to push this aging engine to its absolute limits. If you have been keeping up with our updates, then you are already aware of the first superboss, the Dread, but another awaits you…somewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>From these bosses, and their minions, you will be looting over 380 new Unique items and 120 Monster Infrequents. This is not including Awakened Epic items, which is a list we are still working on and expect to grow post release, or Ascended common drops in Ascendant mode, which have 33 unique tertiary affixes found nowhere else in the game. All this is not even including the two roguelike dungeons we have planned post-release, which will expand the world and add another two rounds of new bosses and unique loot drops.</em></p>

The team <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-definitive-edition-xbox-release-date-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Grim Dawn Definitive Edition for Xbox One in December 2021, including both Ashes of Malmouth and Forgotten Gods.</p>
