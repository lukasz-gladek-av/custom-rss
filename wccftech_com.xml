			<p>The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is getting a free upgrade on PC in a few days that will introduce, among other things, ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion and support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>
<p>The new update, which will go live on March 4th, will bring all the latest improvements introduced on consoles, including a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao's Special Works, Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trails, Ambient Animals that can be photographed to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge, the ability to obtain special benefits for GTA Online via a GTA+ Membership, a renewed Landing Page, a free GTA$4,000,000 and a few more additional items to get started in GTA Online and more.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the biggest improvements the Grand Theft Auto V March 4th upgrade will bring are new technical enhancements, such as the PC-exclusive ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, plus the ray-traced shadows and reflections also available on current generation consoles, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times using an SSD with DirectStorage, DualSense controller support, and enhanced audio. Following the launch of the update, however, Rockstar Games will continue to support the previous version of the game, allowing those with hardware that does not meet the new minimum requirements to keep playing. The updated requirements can be found below.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support is being integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a new game update. As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, players can take advantage of the new transformer-based DLSS AI model, which improves image quality compared to the previous CNN-based model. Users with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can also enable Multi Frame Generation, reaching much higher frame rates on their configurations. And even GeForce RTX 40 GPU owners can take advantage of the updated Frame Generation model, which delivers higher frame rates and consumes less video RAM.</p>
<p>Moreover, MachineGames improved the game's visuals by adding fully ray traced shadows to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you own an RTX GPU and use ray tracing, the update also adds DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces multiple denoisers with NVIDIA's unified AI model, improving surface detail, drawing more precise shadows are more precise, enhancing lighting and delivering more accurate reflections. Lastly, the game also includes native DLAA support for those with spare headroom (GeForce RTX 5090 owners, in all likelihood). However, it seems like the new RTX Hair feature didn't make it into this update as previously planned.</p>

<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available tomorrow in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, the campaign mode of the shooter game developed by Team Jade. According to NVIDIA, a GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card can get up to 265.9 average frame rate per second in the game with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (CNN model). For more about Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, check out Kai's hands-on preview of this mode.</p>
