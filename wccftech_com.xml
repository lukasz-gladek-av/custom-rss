			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Ironeye Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-very-likely-to-support-4k-resolution-output-new-findings-suggest.1151247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remaster-experts-nightdive-studios-stand-ready-to-take-on-remastering-ps3-and-xbox-360-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main reasons Wccftech was on-site for GDC 2025 this year was to take part in the first hands-on play sessions for 10 Chambers' upcoming cooperative cyberpunk heist title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a>. First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Ulf Andersson made his directorial debut with the new studio founded from the ashes of his days designing PAYDAY and PAYDAY 2.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves takes the neo-futuristic approach where corporations are more than people and instead run the world. While you won't see Weyland-Yutani or Arasaka Corp logos on city streets, the sentiment is still very much the same with the megacorps that make up Den of Wolves' setting. As mentioned in my first impressions piece on Den of Wolves, the setting 10 Chambers is working with is a corporate haven known as Midway City, sheltered out in the mid-Pacific that operates outside jurisdictional waters or AI intranets. It's here that a new form of data transmission emerges right out of Johnny Mneumonic's playbook: human brains as cold storage.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite difficult to convey the concept of brain-jacking and stealing secrets from someone's mind in a two-mission preview, but 10 Chambers gave a decent amount of onboarding to get into the flow of the heists. The first mission began with a smaller prep mission to get in and extract some key items for the larger heist. This played out across a small cluster of individual rooms linked together by closed vault doors where teammates need to regroup back before jumping into the next segmented room. It's a formulaic approach that 10 Chambers designed into the core gameplay loop of the studio's previous game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>) that may feel like more of an homage to their previous title than something necessary to crack open some vaults. On the bright side, these discrete rooms do reset the enemy alarms, so players can attempt once more to go for a stealthy approach after getting into an accidental gunfight.</p>
<p>This mini-mission in Den of Wolves resulted in some half-dozen rooms with shorter encounters with a handful of guards and armed combatants on our way to gather some loot bags and head to an elevator for extraction under a constant stream of ever-respawning enemies. It's here that I learned the hard way that these prep missions are an all-or-nothing solution, and all four team members needed to walk out alive for the mission progress to count and what we've picked up to carry over. Sadly, I was the first to go down after foolishly trying to make a break for it and grabbing another loot bag on the way out. I had to lie idly by and watch as groups of five or more guards would spawn one at a time and fill the hallway with bullets, thus preventing my team from making a safe extraction, even if down a member.</p>
<p>Our second mission in Den of Wolves certainly went smoothly by comparison. It was a by-the-numbers vault-busting mission to start with the prep phase letting us swap out our primary and secondary weapons as well as choose an additional equipment tool, like a turret or deployable shield. No glimpse at the character or deeper customization options, so I was limited to the one mask and outfit on hand that were pre-selected for me. Given the sheer number of mask options in the first two PAYDAY titles, I do expect Den of Wolves to bring in a wide range of customization options to incentivize players to keep coming back for heists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our team split up into groups of two, each taking one-half of the bank vaults on each side, drilling through a number of vaults to find the sacks of loot we'd then pile up at a massive glass window that would prove to be our one way out. There were a few security guards throughout with more coming in at a drip feed as we made our way to the second part of the mission: diving into our target's brain to gather some crucial data stored in their human brain.</p>
<p>This segment is where Den of Wolves morphs into something I wasn't expecting. In the middle of gunfights, suddenly, our team would be pulled into the mind of the target and forced to run through a 3D parkour gauntlet where reality would rotate on a whim and force our entire squad to endure a running challenge to jump and scramble all the way to an exit point. In those moments, only one of the squad would need to actually be successful, but I wouldn't want to rely on just one person to clear it every time. After a successful dive, we'd be pulled right back into the firefight as if nothing had happened and proceed on as normal with the heist before getting pulled back in another one or two times before extracting all the information we needed from the target's brain.</p>
<p>Coming from GTFO, Den of Wolves feels much more in line with the difficulty curve that heist enjoyers would come to expect from the genre. There are still some obvious growing pains for 10 Chambers to overcome, from creating an enemy AI that's more responsive to flanking maneuvers to gunplay that feels more impactful in each shot. But for those looking for their next heist fix to play with friends online, Ulf Andersson and his team already have a good feel for what their next big move will be. Den of Wolves is currently slated as a PC exclusive without a release date in sight.</p>
