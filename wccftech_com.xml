			<p>EA Sports has officially unveiled F1 25. This year's edition of the licensed FIA Formula One World Championship racing game will debut on May 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $59.99 and the Iconic Edition priced at $79.99. All pre-orders will receive the F1 75 Celebration Pack (suit, gloves, and livery). The Standard Edition also gets the F1 World Starter Pack (10K cash and F1 World Resources) and 5,000 PitCoin. The Iconic Edition, on the other hand, will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis Hamilton Iconic Pack</li>
<li>Lewis Hamilton F1 World Event in F1 24</li>
<li>3 days of early access</li>
<li>F1 The Movie â€“ Chapter Scenarios</li>
<li>APXGP Team Pack</li>
<li>Collection of 2025 season liveries immediately in Time Trial in F1 24</li>
<li>F3 Driver Icons</li>

<li>One month of F1 TV Pro subscription (only for US customers)</li>
</ul>
<p>F1 25 includes Braking Point 3, the latest chapter in the series' story mode, with Konnersport now battling for championships as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point 3 comes with multiple difficulty settings in an attempt to cater to returning vets and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>The popular My Team game mode has been improved. Players will now be calling the shots as the owners of their F1 team. On the track, F1 25 will feature the latest version of the EGO engine, which Codemasters says will deliver enhanced circuit authenticity powered by LIDAR technology. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed in the coming weeks through the F1 25 Deep Dive series. Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters, said:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory. This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrystalDynamics/status/1904969991968956833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future.</p>
<p>The full statement reads as follows below:</p>
<p><em>This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.</em></p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.</em></p>
<p>As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-perfect-dark-reboot-crystal-dynamics-embracer/">The Initiative</a> is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Director on Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/">Embracer Group</a>, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/5-years-after-avengers-2-years-after-its-last-layoffs-and-who-knows-how-long-before-perfect-dark-and-tomb-raider-return-crystal-dynamics-announces-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only seen 27 layoffs</a> in a total of three years, while some companies have <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">experienced closures</a>, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse.</p>
<p>Already this year, there have been an <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1,493 employees</a> laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.</p>

			<p>NEOWIZ took everyone by surprise with Lies of P. The Soulslike game enthralled a lot of fans with its unique setting, which was very loosely inspired by Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, and its solid Soulslike combat system. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech</a> and quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a million seller</a>.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a sequel</a>, but before that, they are launching a DLC called <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overture</a>. Ahead of the expansion's release, slated for this Summer, we caught up with Game Director Choi Ji-won at San Francisco's Game Developers Conference 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lies of P Overture was certainly not what players were expecting after the ending tease from the base game. For those that don't know much about Overture, can you talk a little bit more about that?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, to answer your question, the delay that is shown at the very end of the base game is actually not going to be in Overture. Overture itself, for us, is the completion of the Lies of P game as a whole. It is something that we truly wanted to deliver when we released the base game. It's a sort of continuation of that.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider releasing Lies of P Overture as a standalone game? The base game just left Game Pass, and there are many customers who are more inclined to buy expansions if they are standalone.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for bringing that up. It's a good question, but allow me to elaborate on our view. Lies of P Overture is an expansion, but it's not separate. It's an opportunity for us to really complete the Lies of P experience. What this means is that it's almost like a developer's cut. We would not be able to deliver it as a separate product because it's so intertwined with the base game. That's how we want customers to experience Lies of P.</p>
<p><strong>When, during a Lies of P playthrough, will players be able to enjoy Overture?</strong></p>
<p>To be precise, around Chapter 9 is when you'll be able to jump into the world of the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Is that where the Golden Stargazer is?</strong></p>
<p>I don't remember exactly, but I believe so. There is actually an NPC that explains it.</p>
<p><strong>What level of equipment should players acquire before being able to experience Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gotten to Chapter 9, you will be ready to experience the expansion. But even if you have finished the game completely, you will also have a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p><strong>In the feedback, what did fans talk about wanting to see the most in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of feedback. I would categorize it into three main areas: music, story, and combat. We wanted to ensure all three areas had quality and more content to be introduced, so customers will experience an extension in all three areas. That was difficult.</p>
<p><strong>There were many diverse music tracks in Lies of P. Can you give us some teases about what players can expect to hear in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much for that question. Certainly, there is a lot of interconnectivity between the soundtracks of Overture and the base game. Of course, you'll have to wait to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Will the cat Spring be important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Spring is an extremely precious element in the game, so yes.</p>
<p><strong>In the base game, much attention was paid to how the various levels were laid out. They were looping, and secrets were scattered throughout them, but players felt like there weren't many missable secrets. Will Lies of P have more secrets, or will it be similar in this regard?</strong></p>
<p>It's a very interesting question. Yes, you could certainly miss some areas, but you would still experience the game as a whole. We designed Overture so that you would have more adventures to experience.</p>
<p><strong>For players who want to experience those adventures, how is the difficulty in Lies of P Overture going to compare to the base game?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically instead of adjusting and setting certain difficulty bars.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically. One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you have any examples to share of that diversity?</strong></p>
<p>One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new. I guess that, indirectly, could be related to the difficulty level because it's something new.</p>
<p><strong>Will parrying be as important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>All aspects of combat are very important to us. We wanted to make sure players would be in situations where they could use all these diverse aspects of combat that we have designed.</p>
<p><b>I asked because, in the base game, there is a very notorious clown boss where players have to learn how to parry; otherwise, they really could not progress further.</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a very good example where players have to learn certain aspects of the game and learn how to get better at them. In fact, that helped us implement fights in the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>One piece of feedback that I've heard a lot from the original game is that the time spent going from a checkpoint to running back to a boss arena was a chore. It was a lot of time spent between new boss tries. Have you addressed that in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>That's also something we definitely heard a lot and took into consideration when designing the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Legion Arm weapons, like the Puppet String, were very popular. Are there going to be more of those?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, certainly. That really is a prime example. We want fans to experience many different things that we provide.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about the length of the experience, can you compare it to certain chapters or maybe just provide an hour count?</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, we cannot be too specific about that because we want them to experience Lies of P Overture without having a set of expectations. But it should be around 15 to 20 hours for experienced players.</p>
<p><strong>Switching topics to the technical side, Lies of P was a very beautiful game and a bit of a showcase for AMD FSR. Will you be implementing the new AMD FSR 4?</strong></p>
<p>For us, the most important things are the user experience and general optimization. We are really putting a lot of effort into these. We cannot go into much detail about the improvements that we are making, but optimization is key.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite weapon combination in Lies of P?</strong></p>
<p>I like everything. I am not lying to you: I really like every one of those combinations because they give us different combat flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
