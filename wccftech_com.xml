			<p>Embark Studios just released its second major title, ARC Raiders, which launched yesterday and made quite the splash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">achieving over 250K concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the biggest launch for an extraction shooter on the platform, and it also surpassed Embark's other major title, The Finals, for its concurrent launch numbers on Steam.</p>



<p>Keeping up with the pace of modern-day live service games, Embark Studios has no intention of slowing down and followed up yesterday's stellar launch with the reveal of the game's roadmap for the remainder of 2025.</p>



<p>There are no specific release dates around when the next set of major updates are coming, but it does tell us that we can expect two major updates for the rest of the year, one in November and one in December. Both include new quests and community events, though only the November update includes a new map and new ARC machines for players to combat.</p>



<p>The December update adds Snowfall as a new map condition to fit the holiday mood, a new expedition, and a new raider deck. </p>

<p>"<em>We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us,</em>" Embark Studio <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">writes on its website in its roadmap blog post</a>, "<em>and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind. Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the roadmap shown off today, Embark Studios has also already put out the first hotfix for the game, which was intended to fix some server issues and animation issues. Though overall, yesterday (and so far today), has gone on without major reports about the servers being broken or players waiting in long queues. For an indie team making online multiplayer games, that's an impressive feat on its own.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-sidekicks-are-cute-pets-that-follow-you-around-but-can-only-be-customized-once-unless-you-buy-them-again.1340638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has introduced a new category of cosmetics called Fortnite Sidekicks. They're essentially pets that follow the player around in various modes, including Battle Royale, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-fortnite-gets-launch-of-new-game-and-major-content-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a>, Save the World, Fortnite Festival (though they'll remain backstage), and even user-made experiences (though only if the creator has enabled them).</p>



<p>They won't provide any gameplay advantages, so their only real perk is looking cute. They do, however, react to the surrounding world, and players can interact with them through special Sidekick Emotes. The first one to be introduced to the game is Peels, a 'banana dog', which will be available to be unlocked via the Battle Pass starting tomorrow. Bonesy (which will be granted to owners of the Bonesy Back Bling), Spike, and Lilâ€™ Raptor will go live next Friday, and Epic also teased that there will soon be something for the many cat lovers out there.</p>



<p>It sounds like yet another idea that will earn Epic a lot of money, especially because they are locking repeated customization beyond multiple purchases of the same pet. That's right: you may only customize the physical traits of Fortnite Sidekicks once. If you purchase it multiple times, you can give it separate Appearances, which must be unique (duplicate Appearances are not allowed). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, some Fortnite players have already criticized this choice as a blatant way to extract more money from the user base. It is especially lamentable, since younger players may well be among the most interested in this kind of cosmetic customization. That said, Epic does allow you to change the Sidekick's name and accessories at any time, and you can also earn hats and hoodies by hanging out with your pet and using your Sidekick Points.</p>



<p>The current Fortnite season, Shock 'N Awesome, will end tomorrow at 8:30 AM Pacific Time/11:30 AM Eastern Time/4:30 PM Central European Time. The downtime is expected to last around two to three hours, after which Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 5, which is known to be themed around The Simpsons, will go live.</p>

			<p>It's Halloween at the time of this writing, which means it's the perfect day to turn off the lights and play a horror game, whether that's something new like Cronos: The New Dawn and Silent Hill f, or a classic like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation. Developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games' upcoming isometric 80s-themed horror adventure was unfortunately never going to be an option this Halloween, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">as it was due to come out on November 7, 2025</a>, but now it won't even be coming out this year.</p>



<p>A new story trailer released today shows off more of the game's spooky vibes, which is more than fitting for this time of year, but it ends with the revelation that the game will no longer make its November 7, 2025 date. Instead, it'll now release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on January 29, 2026.</p>

<p>"<em>As for the date change, we decided that we need a little more time to better incorporate some changes and features gathered from community feedback</em>,<em>" </em>Broken Mirror Games wrote <a href="https://x.com/BMGhorrors/status/1984260318382658038">in a post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>We feel the game deserves to make a good first impression so we rethought things and set the new release window to January 2026. Thanks for your patience and understanding.</em>"</p>



<p>Broken Mirror Games' debut title is based on the comic book by writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, with players facing supernatural entities in this 80s-themed world. It was first showcased in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">March 2025</a>, and prior to this delay, was expected to arrive sometime before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At least with its current release date, by the time we get to October 31, 2026, you'll probably be able to grab I Hate This Place as part of a spooky sale if you hadn't already picked it up. In the meantime, if you do want to check it out, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">a demo currently available on PC</a> that was featured in the latest Steam Next Fest. </p>
