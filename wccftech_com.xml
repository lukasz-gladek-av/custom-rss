			<p>Legion Studios is a relatively new and small studio that contains a team of 12 people who all have a significant amount of experience. The team consists of developers from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">Halo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/">Doom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-from-the-rift-update-available-today-adding-new-cosmetics-launch-royale-more/">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">Battlefield</a>, all of which are announced in the first gameplay trailer that they revealed. They have just announced their new and upcoming game called Covenant, which is a first-person dark fantasy combat game. To get a glimpse at what the game will be looking like, check out the first gameplay trailer below. The trailer is just under three minutes long.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxeAuWTduC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Covenant will have a Metroidvania and Soulslike world, where players will get to explore a vast, interconnected world, where you'll get to go on a long and arduous journey to discover the fighting stances, weaponry, spells, and armor that can help you become powerful in the game. The footage seen in the trailer shows that Covenant will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, with the footage in the video being from a pre-alpha, in-engine build of the game. Despite that, the quality looks great, and the world looks incredibly detailed and reminiscent of FromSoftware games. Even the narration that sets the tone of the video feels very much like a Soulslike. However, it is pretty rare to see a first-person Soulslike, so it'll be interesting to see how Covenant will shape up and whether it'll be closer to a game like Remnant. However, even that title is in the third person. With how quick movements and attacks are in a Soulslike, it seems like being in first-person will provide an additional challenge that may not sit well with those who are fans of the genre.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sort of ETA or release window for Covenant, which is to be expected, considering this is really the first time anyone is hearing about the game. They shared some relatively generic PC specs for the title, which can be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. If this game is something you are interested in, you are able to wishlist this game now on Steam.</p>
<p>Much like many Soulslike or Metroidvanias, you will be able to play alone, as well as play with friends in co-op, if that is your preferred method for these types of games. There are also plenty of PvP opportunities, as you will be able to battle in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this reveal?</p>
