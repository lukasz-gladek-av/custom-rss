            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the final week of September, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">a report from The Wall Street Journal claimed</a> that Electronic Arts (EA) was going private in a massive $50 billion buyout, with the major investors being Silver Lake, a private equity company run by Jared Kushner, and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), among others. A few days later, the news would be confirmed, with EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">officially announcing it had agreed to be acquired by this 'Consortium' of investors for $55 billion</a>, and the video game industry has had endless questions ever since.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">Questions about the $20 billion of debt</a> that EA takes on with this deal, and what impact that will have on EA's future. Questions about whether EA will be able to continue making the kinds of games it makes now under its new ownership, and if the developers making those games will still be the ones who get to say what goes into those games and what doesn't. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">In an updated version of its FAQ</a> about the deal for EA employees (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners">Game File</a>), it seems like EA has tried to answer that question.</p>



<p>Under the question, "<em>Will our culture change as a result of this deal?</em>" a new line has been added which claims that "<em>EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact</em>."</p>



<p>Additionally, under the question "<em>What influence will these stockholders have on creative or business decisions?</em>" EA claims "<em>The Consortium believes in our vision, our leadership and our focus on creating games, stories, and content that reflect a range of experiences and delivering them to our global player community. They're investing in the creativity that defines EA</em>."</p>



<p>If this deal goes through, we'll see where these claims stand once we've seen EA release a game under its new ownership. Of course, there's the chance that these claims remain true, and that none of the new owners will try to influence creative control over EA titles. Or, we could see a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">similar situation to Fatal Fury adding Cristiano Ronaldo to the game</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, another element of the FAQ goes against a report from last week. Under the question, "<em>Will our approach to AI change under new ownership?</em>" an answer line reads, "<em>We will maintain a thoughtful, steady approach to AI. AI is a tool to empower our people to put creativity first by reimagining workflows and amplifying the creative power of our teams</em>."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> report, which quotes several current EA employees, does not describe EA's approach to AI as "<em>steady</em>" or "<em>thoughtful</em>," but rather that EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">is pushing AI on its employees in every task</a>, with tools meant to produce code in particular, causing a mountain of issues that then need to be fixed manually.</p>



<p>That said, workflows going from what they used to be, i.e. a programmer writing code, doing their best to make no mistakes, to having an AI tool write hundreds of lines of code without any care for the quality of it that then has to be fixed manually, does count as workflows being "<em>reimagined</em>" by AI if you think about it.</p>

			<p>It will be years before we are close to even the release date for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, but that hasn't stopped people from asking CD Projekt RED and anyone connected to the series about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">We know the game is in pre-production</a>, and that it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">feature a kind of "<em>Chicago gone wrong</em>"</a> setting, and as of September, we know that Hollywood star <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/">Keanu Reeves would "<em>absolutely</em>" love to find a way back to the series to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand</a>. </p>



<p>Well, according to series creator Mike Pondsmith in a recent anniversary live stream that CD Projekt RED hosted, all Reeves needs to do is pick up the phone. Speaking on the stream, Pondsmith said, "<em>Not that long ago</em>, <em>I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I have ways to do that, Keanu</em>. <em>Contact me</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pondsmith has already made it clear that he's not as involved with the sequel as he was with the first game, so while he might have an idea as to how Johnny Silverhand could come back from the dead and get Keanu Reeves back in the game, he might not necessarily have the authority to make it happen. CD Projekt RED could be on an entirely different path that doesn't involve Silverhand, so even if Reeves picks up the phone, it's not a sure bet.</p>



<p>Still, it would be exciting for fans to see him make a comeback in a way more meaningful than perhaps a flashback scene, which is currently the most feasible way we'd see Silverhand again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bill Roper, a Blizzard veteran who worked on the first games in the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises in various capacities (producer, design, voice-over, etc.), has announced that his studio has secured funding for Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>The studio, Lunacy Games, was actually supposed to produce <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellgate-redemption-ue5-sequel-hellgate-london-details-sketchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellgate: Redemption</a>, a sequel to Hellgate: London, a cult classic Diablo-like game that Roper created after departing from Blizzard, and a game called Skinwalkers, which would merge the Weird West and Cthulhu settings, with players acting as cowboys. However, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/bill-robers-lunacy-games-raises-500k-from-accelerator-for-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Roper said the studio couldn't find anyone who would fund this project, which required between $15 million and $20 million. </p>



<p>They did find someone to fund Innsmouth Mysteries, though. <a href="https://www.bbx.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Accelerator</a> agreed to provide $500K for the project, which is a cooperative horror extraction roleplaying game inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In a mysterious 1920s seaside town, a team of player-controlled supernatural investigators must uncover the truth, collect arcane artifacts, and stop an ancient evil from being unleashed before midnight strikes.</p>



<p>Ying Sha, co-founder of BBX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Lunacy Games has a clear and compelling vision for a Co-op Horror Extraction RPG, and it's backed by a team of veterans whose track record speaks for itself. We are proud to support studios like theirs that are pushing the boundaries of games. We see Innsmouth Mysteries as a project that perfectly aligns with our mission to support talented teams to bring high-quality, deeply engaging experiences to players.</em></p>



<p>For his part, Roper believes there's a significant middle ground between triple-A and indie games that is currently underserved, a place where exciting gameplay mixes with deep, immersive, and story-rich experiences, which the studio aims to deliver with Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>Lunacy Games currently has just 13 employees, and Roper himself contributes to the audio work as well. There's no release window yet, but we'll keep track of the progress.</p>
