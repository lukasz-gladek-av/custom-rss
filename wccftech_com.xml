			<p>The amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/3dsen-nes-emulator-brings-new-life-to-final-fantasy-dragon-quest/">3dSen NES emulator</a> has finally left early access after having been in development for 10 years, and its 1.0 release is now available for purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>The emulator is a passion project that reimagines classic NES games by turning them from 2D to playable 3D voxel dioramas. The improvements introduced to the supported games don't stop here, as the emulator introduced real-time lighting and shadows and animated skyboxes that breathe new life into some all-time classics. Unfortunately, the emulator doesn't yet support every NES game, but among the 100+ currently supported games are the Super Mario Bros. games, Contra, Metroid, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Duck Hunt, Mega Man, Castlevania, and others. The list of supported titles is constantly expanding thanks to the work of the <a href="https://itch.io/board/872690/profile-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community,</a> which is creating custom profiles using 3dSenMaker.</p>
<p>In case you have never seen the 3dSen emulator in action, you can check out the trailer below shared to celebrate its 1.0 release.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenia-canary-development-team-is-not-working-with-microsoft-on-the-xbox-classics-program.1225476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenia Canary development team is not working with Microsoft on the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/">Xbox Classics program</a>, the team itself confirmed in a new statement shared online.</p>
<p>As reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lhsg0m/xenia_team_post_official_response_about_rumoured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the development team of the Xbox 360 emulator confirmed on their official Discord server that they are not associated with Microsoft by any means, nor are they working with the company in any capacity. Microsoft uses its own emulation to deliver backward compatibility on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, the team added, and, as such, has no reason to collaborate with Xenia if they ever decide to bring their games to PC.</p>
<p>Though one may argue the Xenia Canary team could never confirm they are working on the Xbox Classics program under an NDA, if the team actually signed such an agreement, they would keep their silence on the matter, so at this point, there's no reason not to believe the developer's official statement. This doesn't mean that Microsoft isn't working on bringing classic Xbox games to PC and current consoles, but it also makes the rumor less credible, although the original leaker has doubled down on the matter, saying that such a program is indeed in the works and will be revealed next year to coincide with Xbox's 25th anniversary.</p>

			<p>Marvel Snap, the digital collectible card game that's been live for nearly three years, has been accused of stealing art from the Japanese tokusatsu drama Kamen Rider Wizard. More specifically, users <a href="https://x.com/Tewakuumea/status/1933090847089979699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> that the art used for the Ancient One's magic shield is nearly identical, as you can see in the comparison below.</p>


<p>The original designer of Kamen Rider Wizard, which aired a total of 53 episodes between September 2012 and 2013, didn't take it very well. On their X account, they <a href="https://x.com/tajimax1968/status/1933479652292734983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oh my. I don't know this game, but this may be a huge rip-off. By the way, the dragon in the center is a PLEX design, and the outer circle surrounding it is all my own. The text is designed by my junior colleague and means a spell to gain power from magic stones. The text was written by K-kun from our literary team. Needless to say, everything is undoubtedly original.</em></p>
<p><em>As a designer, I find it distasteful. Above all, it is extremely disrespectful to fans of both characters. It ignores the original and is distributed and used as if it were originally this character's, which makes me feel angry and sad. Especially since I love MARVEL so much.</em></p>
<p>Griffin, the Community Manager of Marvel Snap, replied on the game's official Discord channel that the report is being 'investigated'. That was a while ago, however.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to the forefront of gaming news earlier this year due to the temporary TikTok ban enforced in the United States. At the time, the game was still published by Nuverse, which is owned by ByteDance, the same company behind TikTok.</p>
<p>The ban only lasted a couple of days, but later in January 2025, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner announced the decision to switch to Skystone Games, a US-based publisher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In March 2021, Bellevue-based game development studio Hidden Path Entertainment (known mainly for Defense Grid and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-aaa-open-world-rpg-coming-from-hidden-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on a third-person open world AAA RPG based on the D&amp;D license. At the time, the developer was still recruiting for key roles, such as Graphics Programmer, Lead Graphics Programmer, Senior Technical Artist, and Writer.</p>
<p>It was an exciting project, as we had never had a true open world D&amp;D RPG. Unfortunately, the game never materialized. In January 2023, Dungeons and Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> several games, including a game in development at Otherside and Hidden Path's open world title. Intriguingly, at that time, Hidden Path denied that the project was already dead as they tried to find other funding sources.&nbsp;However, it ultimately had to resign itself in February 2024, when the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-open-world-rpg-from-hidden-path-is-officially-halted-as-developer-lays-off-44-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> 44 employees.</p>
<p>Although we may never play the game ourselves, we can now at least take a look at it. MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the portfolio of a former employee, which included several details and even some gameplay footage of a mission, which you can find embedded below.</p>

<p>The D&amp;D open world RPG was codenamed Project Dante. The gameplay seemed very similar to a regular third-person action RPG, with stealth mechanics on display as well. The player character was accompanied by two companions, as befitting a Dungeons &amp; Dragons title.</p>
<p>There's also an IMGUR gallery featuring concept art for the canceled game. You can browse it below.</p>
<blockquote lang="en" data-id="a/ZCdr9WI"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI">View post on imgur.com</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this cancellation, D&amp;D gaming fans have plenty of other projects to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a> (out this year)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooperative multiplayer game made by Starbreeze</a> and scheduled for 2026</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new game from Invoke</a> (the studio behind Dark Alliance)</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a couple of years since Crate Entertainment announced Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn, a new expansion coming to the hack-and-slash action RPG. Back then, the US-based studio estimated a launch in 2024, which clearly didn't happen.</p>
<p>Now, the developers have <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/fangs-of-asterkarn-development-update-june-2025/146114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update. The game has a chance of launching late this year, but Crate admitted it could be delayed to Spring or even early Summer 2026. In their partial defense, the developers noted that Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn will be by far the biggest expansion for the game, dwarfing <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-ashes-of-malmouth-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashes of Malmouth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-forgotten-gods-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgotten Gods</a>:</p>
<p><em>To put things in perspective, by our current estimations, Fangs of Asterkarn will cover approximately 3.55sq. km, which makes it roughly 110% as big as Ashes of Malmouth. Kurnhold, the de-facto capital of the Kurn and the new quest hub, spans 4 zones, compared to the 1.5 that the Covenant of the Three took up in Forgotten Gods.</em></p>
<p><em>In all that world, there are, as of this writing, currently 47 main/side quests, and that number will likely continue to grow as we flesh out the content. Scattered across Asterkarn are 54 new bosses, including 8 new Nemesis encounters. Mechanically, these bosses will feature some of the most advanced skill tech Grim Dawn has had yet as we continue to push this aging engine to its absolute limits. If you have been keeping up with our updates, then you are already aware of the first superboss, the Dread, but another awaits you…somewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>From these bosses, and their minions, you will be looting over 380 new Unique items and 120 Monster Infrequents. This is not including Awakened Epic items, which is a list we are still working on and expect to grow post release, or Ascended common drops in Ascendant mode, which have 33 unique tertiary affixes found nowhere else in the game. All this is not even including the two roguelike dungeons we have planned post-release, which will expand the world and add another two rounds of new bosses and unique loot drops.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/1f89pgp/comment/lld78ko/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last official word</a> is that Crate Entertainment plans to release Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn for the Xbox One simultaneously with the PC version. The team <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-definitive-edition-xbox-release-date-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Grim Dawn Definitive Edition for Xbox One in December 2021, including both Ashes of Malmouth and Forgotten Gods.</p>
