			<p>With Octopath Traveler 2 having been released in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">2023</a>, I did not expect to see a new entry in the series that made HD-2D popular anytime soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Back in July</a>, however, Square Enix surprised fans of the series worldwide with the announcement of Octopath Traveler 0, a new game which isn't a proper sequel to its predecessors, but a sort of new and improved take on the story elements and gameplay ideas seen in the mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent as well as some brand new gameplay mechanics, such as town building mechanics that will allow players to rebuild their hometowns and customize it with a ton of visual customization options.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last month, I was given the chance to try out Octopath Traveler 0 before its release later this year, getting a taste of both the town building mechanics and the gameplay loop, which doesn't seem to stray too far from the classic JRPG loop featured in the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately, a total of around one hour wasn't enough to appreciate the finer details of the experience, and the few minutes I spent rebuilding the town weren't particularly impressive, as, aside from placing some buildings here and there, I couldn't experience how much choices would impact the development of the town and its inhabitants, although things seemed promising enough.</p>

<p>The second half of the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo, on the other hand, felt way more familiar and engaging. Set during one of the early story chapters, I was able to explore a beautiful and lively HD-2D town, interact with NPCs using the series' trademark Path Actions, which can have widely different outcomes depending on a variety of factors, and eventually proceed to a dungeon whose design is in line with the design of dungeons of the previous two entries in the series - a few alternate paths, but a generally straightforward design that easily prevents players from getting lost. As I explored the dungeon, I got into quite a few battles which felt instantly familiar, as the turn-based combat system of new entry in the series hasn't been changed a whole lot. As such, before long, I started hitting enemy weakpoints to Break and stun them, and Boost my characters to enhance the power of their skills to get rid of them in a single turn. The biggest change to the Octopath Traveler 0 combat experience is the bigger party size, eight members instead of four positioned in a front and back row, which I expect will open up a lot of interesting strategies and that is sure to influence enemy design considerably, since it will be easy to hit an enemy weakness with so many characters on hand. Having so many characters and widely diverse skills at my disposal, however, did not make the boss battle awaiting at the end of the dungeon any easier, so even those who mastered the previous two entries in the series should find plenty to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>Thrown into the middle of the adventure with little to no knowledge of skills and synergies for eight different characters, playing the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo felt overwhelming, at times, but as soon as I got a little more acquainted with them, I was hooked once again. With the game's Job system promising to deliver the usual excellent customization features the series is known for, and plenty of unknowns regarding story, characters and the town building mechanics, which still managed to show promise in a short one hour session, I cannot wait to sit down and spend more time with what it setting out to be a more than worthy new entry in the series when it launches on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">recent entries in the series</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is not going to leave the last generation of consoles behind, nor will it skip the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">X</a>, known Capcom leaker Dusk Golem commented on the ninth entry in the popular series launching early next year, saying that it should also release on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, corroborating other rumors circulating online. As for the timing, it's not yet known if these two unannounced versions of the game will launch at the same time as the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions and how they will compare to them, as the insider speculates it will be a different version of the game with different tech behind it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Commenting further on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem touched upon some of the technical aspects of the game, saying that they expect the game will be optimized and polished in the vein of the Resident Evil 4 remake. The developers of Requiem are likely being helped by the team behind previous entries in the series, who have a lot of PC experience, and are taking the time to focus on optimization and polish. Not featuring an open-world setting like Monster Hunter Wilds is also going to ensure the RE Engine will handle the experience well. Hopefully, this will indeed be the case, as some recent games powered by the RE Engine, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, left a lot to be desired in terms of performance and optimization on all platforms, although they were open-world games that offered something different than what the survival horror series usually does.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RE4R over Wilds for certain. Resident Evil Requiem I think is helped the team behind RE games have a lot of PC experience, don't need a full open world, &amp; I think they took time to focus on optimizing &amp; polishing the game, alongside reworking a few areas. <a href="https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T">https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963195557947588740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides commenting on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem also talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/">Resident Evil 0 remake</a>, which is one of the remakes of previous entries in the series to be in the works. Much like the ninth entry in the series, this remake was initially meant to be out by now, but both received internal delays. Last year, the development of the 0 remake was rebooted while changing hands, much like it happened for the Resident Evil 4 remake, so it may be a while until we will see this remake for the first time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/2) Originally, Zero Remake &amp; Resident Evil Requiem were meant to be out by now. But both received internal delays, Zero received a form of reboot &amp; changed hands in who's working on it late last year.</p><p>Keep in mind various scopes of reboots are common in this series, not <a href="https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc">https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963188874697687188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Considering how CAPCOM believes the high price of current-generation consoles is impacting sales of their games, it wouldn't be surprising for Resident Evil Requiem to launch on PlayStation 4 as well. Hopefully, being a cross-gen release won't impact the experience a lot, and from what I experienced during Gamescom, it definitely looks like it hasn't in any significant fashion.</p>

			<p>After much <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">teasing</a>, a Stellar Blade sequel has been confirmed to be in the works.</p>



<p>As reported by Genki_JPN on X, the sequel to the popular action role-playing game originally released on PlayStation 5 last year has been confirmed to be in active development by Shift Up in a new financial report. Details on the game are scarce, but the Korean developer confirmed the second entry in their series will retain the action-packed gameplay of the original while incorporating an expanded universe and improved gameplay. In addition to developing a new entry in the series, the developer is planning to create various works related to the Stellar Blade franchise to expand the IP.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Besides the possibility of a new entry in the series being discussed various times in the past, no one will likely be surprised to learn that the Stellar Blade series will continue, given the fantastic success of the game on both PlayStation 5 and PC. On Steam, in particular, the game became a smashing success right from release, selling 1 million units in three days and becoming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">fastest-selling Korean game</a> on the platform to date. Hopefully, the game will hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">other platforms</a> as well, as it is an action RPG that deserves to be enjoyed by as many players as possible.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's glowing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision, reportedly set to launch in Europe soon, will feature a rather critical change that makes the new release effectively feel like yet another price increase for the system.</p>



<p>As reported today by the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Dealabs</a>, the new CFI-2100 console model discovered back in June 2025 via certification documents filed in Japan is set to launch on September 13 in Europe for €499, the current price of the system. The new hardware revision has been created to optimize production costs, something that is reportedly being achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than all the current Digital Edition models, 825 GB instead of 1 TB, a critical change for a system that cannot run physical games without an additional purchase. The new PlayStation 5 Standard Edition hardware revision, on the other hand, will retain the 1 TB SSD when it launches at a later date. The system's packaging will also feature a visible 825 GB label, so it should be easy to distinguish between the current and the next hardware revisions.</p>



<p>Although this new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision is being released to avoid another price increase, it effectively feels like one, as those purchasing the system in the future will get less than others did at the same price. This new release comes during a tumultuous time for console gaming, as both <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a> increased the price of their systems worldwide in the past few months, making this console generation the first one where systems were cheaper at launch, at least on paper. Hopefully, the global economic situation will improve in the future and prevent other price increases, which would be as disastrous for users as for publishers, as some of them, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">CAPCOM</a>, believe that the high price of systems is impacting the sales of games.</p>
