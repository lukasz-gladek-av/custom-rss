			<p>It appears that Respawn Entertainment has quietly canceled another game project. The news was shared via LinkedIn by former Executive Assistant and Production Coordinator&nbsp;Emilee Evans, who wrote (as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/titanfall-developer-respawn-canceled-fps-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by The Game Post):</p>
<p><em>The unannounced incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role.</em></p>
<p>Evans did not specify what kind of project it was, but the studio had been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> people with 'significant professional experience designing Multiplayer FPS experiences' for the Incubation Team, hinting that it would have been a multiplayer first-person shooter game. That's certainly not surprising, considering that the studio built its fortune on that kind of game with Titanfall and later Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We'll probably never know for sure if it was another attempt to make a new Titanfall, though Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-game-reportedly-in-development-at-respawn-though-it-wont-be-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> last year that the studio was indeed developing another game in the franchise. This would be the second time (that we know of) a new franchise installment gets canceled, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-legends-single-player-gamer-canceled-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of the Titanfall Legends single player project</a> in early 2023.</p>
<p>About a year later, Respawn Entertainment's parent company, Electronic Arts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> another game in development at the studio, a multiplayer first-person shooter set in the world of Star Wars. Back then, EA CEO Andrew Wilson highlighted the need to move away from licensed IPs due to the licensing costs. That excuse is certainly not applicable to new Titanfall games, though.</p>
<p>Right now, the Los Angeles based studio is certainly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi franchise. They should also still be publishing an upcoming XCOM-like Star Wars tactics strategy game with Bit Reactor. In June 2024, the developers <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked to PC Gamer</a> about the partnership:</p>
<p><em>Respawn really treats us like an internal team. They've been really good to us. They encourage collaboration and communication between teams. And so they've been just flat out the best experience I've ever had in publishing. They trust us to make the kind of game we know how to make.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Path tracing looks stunning in video games, both old and new, but the hardware definitely still isn't quite there yet to offer decent performance on anything that isn't top-end, as highlighted in a new showcase of a recently released Left 4 Dead 2 RTX Remix mod.</p>
<p>The mod, which can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/l4d2-rtx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is a compatibility mod that makes the classic game by Valve compatible with RTX Remix and, as such, lacks some advanced features. Even with some issues, however, path tracing undoubtedly breathes new life into the game's visuals in some scenarios but does so at a very heavy cost, as highlighted in the new showcase shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>. At 4K resolution, very high settings, the game goes from running at around 500 FPS to running at unsteady 60 FPS with the RTX Remix mod and NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Performance preset, a huge hit in performance that highlights how even one of the most powerful GPUs on the market isn't ready to handle path tracing at 4K resolution. Even at 1440p resolution, the RTX 5080 doesn't run the game as well as one might expect with the path tracing mod, requiring Frame Generation to hit an average of 90 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Left 4 Dead 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix On vs Off - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHKBqCJW9Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at how the Left 4 Dead 2 RTX Remix path tracing mod challenges even an RTX 5080 GPU, it looks like Frame Generation will continue to be a necessity to reach acceptable levels of performance in games that support the technology. Multi Frame Generation, which is currently available on RTX 5000 series cards only, makes it possible to enjoy games with path tracing at high resolution and framerates, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

			<p>It's been a while since Bethesda Game Studios provided an updated roadmap of what's next for Starfield. Fans have been reaching out to the developer, and now the game's official X account has <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> 'lots of exciting things' coming to the game later in 2025:</p>
<p><em>We know you're eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right. Weâ€™re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</em></p>
<p>2024 was filled with lots of updates, such as the one that added the much-requested Rev-8 land vehicle, not to mention the Shattered Space expansion. However, the premium DLC wasn't that well-received, getting just a six out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if the game gets another full-fledged expansion this year or just some free updates. Bethesda's Todd Howard did <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> the team was gearing up to release annual story expansions, but plans might have changed, especially as the studio is very busy with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>Still, there is that Starborn trademark that Bethesda&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> in the Summer of 2024; fans have been speculating it could be the title of the next Starfield expansion. We'll probably learn a lot more about the future of Starfield during June's Xbox Games Showcase. Keep in mind that one of those exciting things could very well be the long rumored PlayStation 5 release, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to be close now.</p>
