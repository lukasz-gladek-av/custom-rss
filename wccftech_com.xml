            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, owner of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, has responded to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders, doubling-down on allegations that co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio, and that their absence had been impacting the development team for Subnautica 2 as far back as July 2023.</p>



<p>Backing up slightly, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, each co-founder of Unknown Worlds and together creators of the original Subnautica, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">sued their former employer, KRAFTON</a>, after KRAFTON fired all three of them and delayed Subnautica 2 from its initial 2025 release window into 2026. There's a whole whack of <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">events that led up to that lawsuit you can check out in a bullet-point list, here.</a></p>



<p>A key element that KRAFTON has pushed since the public dispute between Cleveland, McGuire, Gill, and KRAFTON began is KRAFTON's allegation that the co-founders<em> </em>weren't actually working on Subnautica 2 at all, and in the company's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">response filing published August 12, 2025</a>, KRAFTON tries to drill that point home even further.</p>



<p>KRAFTON claims that once it had successfully acquired Unknown Worlds, Cleveland and McGuire took their earnings from the sale and "<em>quickly lost interest in developing Subnautica 2</em>," the filing reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide game director and technical director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game</em>."</p>



<p>The filing continues to allege that Cleveland in particular had left his videogame development career to pursue filmmaking, another point that KRAFTON has brought up before.</p>



<p>KRAFTON goes on to allege that two months prior to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill claiming the game was ready for an early access launch, the development lead on Subnautica 2 said the first stage of early access for the game would be "<em>about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope</em>," and that the lead joked the game "<em>would be in development for 30 years</em>" at the current pace it was going earlier this year.</p>



<p>To further its point about Cleveland and McGuire leaving their posts, KRAFTON claims the two co-founders declined to return to their roles as game director and technical director, and that Gill had even stated "<em>there's no coming back to a job they didn't have</em>." Following that, KRAFTON includes a statement allegedly from Cleveland, in which Cleveland admits that Subnautica 2's development began with the intention of having a younger generation of development talent at Unknown Worlds take the helm for the sequel, and that he knew that he "<em>wasn't going to be running that team</em>" from the beginning.</p>



<p>All of this will be worked out in the courts over the course of the coming months, potentially even years, and right now the dispute can be boiled down to both sides flinging claims at the other that we can't yet know to be totally true. </p>



<p>Whichever way it goes, it'll be interesting to see how this dispute ends, and which of the claims being flung end up sticking.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ready or Not VR Mod Coming from VR YouTuber]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-vr-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ready-or-not-vr-mod-coming-from-vr-youtuber.1268268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">VR</a> <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">Games Showcase</a> is an event usually reserved for announcing new games or updates on current VR games. It's one of the few digital showcases in a year that VR enthusiasts should pay attention to in order to find out what's on the docket for VR games on PCVR, Meta Quest, and a few PlayStation VR2 games as well. Today's show however, included its very first mod, as a VR mod for popular shooter Ready or Not was revealed.</p>



<p>Ready or Not is a new tactical first-person shooter from VOID Interactive that initially launched on PC in December 2023. In less than two years following that launch, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">sold 9 million copies on PC</a>, a milestone reached a little less than three months before it arrived on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, where it went on to sell another <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-hits-2-million-copies-sold-console/">2 million copies</a> just two weeks after its July 15, 2025, arrival on consoles.</p>



<p>It's unusual, to say the least, for a mod announcement to be part of a showcase like the VR Games Showcase, which also noted that this VR mod was the first time the presentation had featured a mod, but given the current popularity of Ready or Not, the mod's inclusion does make sense.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ready or Not VR Mod Annoucement Trailer | VR Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yt0G1J9Dcug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The mod is being made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualRealityOasis">Virtual Reality Oasis YouTuber Mike Cussell</a>, who is also a co-founder of a VR influencer marketing and game testing company, <a href="https://www.xrgamelabs.com/">XR Game Labs</a>. Cussell isn't alone in the project however, as he's developing it with modder KITT to bring the tactical gameplay of Ready or Not to life in VR.</p>



<p>When the mod is ready, it'll be available to everyone who owns the base game for free, and according to Cussell, it'll be ready "<em>soon</em>," though no actual release date or release window was confirmed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also currently no indication that Cussell and KITT could work with VOID Interactive to help bring the game to VR for PlayStation players, though if the mod proves popular with PC players, it could potentially be something VOID Interactive looks into for the future. Until then, PlayStation VR2 owners are better off buying that adaptor to plug their headset into their PC and hope for the best when the mod arrives.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-versus-mode-closest-thing-game-master-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-mod-%E2%80%98versus-mode%E2%80%99-is-the-closest-thing-there-is-to-a-game-master-mode.1268265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a better game than Larian's previous title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, in almost every regard, with one notable exception: the former game's lack of a Game Master mode. Divinity: Original Sin 2, on the other hand, allowed Game Masters (or Dungeon Masters, as they are usually called in tabletop RPGs) to recreate the atmosphere of a pen-and-paper game, crafting brand new adventures and quests where other players, the so-called 'party of heroes', were ultimately at their whims.</p>



<p>It was the closest thing gamers could find to a videogame version of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons session. It would stand to reason that Baldur's Gate 3, a game made on the D&amp;D license, would get that as well, but it did not. Larian Studios CEO and Game Director Swen Vincke explained a few years ago that it would have taken way too much time and effort, and given that Baldur's Gate 3 ended up being a gargantuan game (even larger than Divinity: Original Sin 2), the mode simply never materialized.</p>



<p>However, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get proper modding tools about a year ago</a>, and now modder 786r786 has uploaded a 'Versus Mode' mod on both <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17984?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/versus-mode4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod.io</a>. While not nearly as extensive as the Game Master mode in Larian's previous game, it does allow the host of an online session to gain control of monsters:</p>



<p><em>When an enemy's turn starts, the game gives control to the host player allowing players to fight against each other by controlling enemies. Make sure to click the blue enemy portraits at the start of their turn to actually control them.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This mod is intended to be used in multiplayer with two or more players.</strong> To use this mod correctly, have the host player spectate the other players until they enter combat at which point the host will be able to control the enemies on their turn.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this Versus Mode can be expanded in the future to allow something even closer to the aforementioned Game Master mode featured in Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

<p>"<em>After running playtests with our Discord community over the last 6 months, and receiving some fantastic feedback, we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions,"</em> writes Brendan Greene, also known as PlayerUnknown, in a press release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ninja Gaiden 4 to Last 15-20 Hours, Plus Challenge Missions and Optional ‘Purgatory’ Battles]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours-plus-challenge-missions-and-optional-%E2%80%98purgatory%E2%80%99-battles.1268187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-1-hour-new-gameplay-team-ninja-explains-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of fresh new gameplay footage</a>, Team Ninja has now also shared an estimate of how long Ninja Gaiden 4 is going to be when it releases later this year. <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Australian website Next Play</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama said that the first playthrough should take most players between fifteen and twenty hours, but then there are also the Challenge Missions to consider.</p>



<p><em>Your first playthrough, you can expect about 15 to 20 hours. But, like I mentioned before, after you beat the game once, you unlock Master Ninja difficulty and then, of course, outside of the story mode, there’s also the challenge missions and also chapter challenge as well … so there’s going to be a robust amount of content for players to sink their teeth into after they complete their first playthrough.</em></p>



<p>Regarding these Challenge Missions, Hirayama-san added:</p>



<p><em>In the full release, there’ll be missions outside of just boss fights. So you have to fight in groups of enemies under special conditions that differ from what you experienced in the story mode.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 also offers some optional battles hidden within the game 'Purgatory', and you can even wager before entering these fights. Hirayama explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s kind of an evolution of the Tests of Valor that were in previous Ninja Gaiden games. The idea of having players choose the level of risk for that reward, that was something we included to kind of stoke the flames of challenge.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, with Xbox Game Studios publishing the title. It will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Just like all the games published by Xbox Game Studios, it will also be available for PC and Xbox Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>
