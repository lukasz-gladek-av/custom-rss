			<p>Festivities are returning to the streets of Los Santos, and players will get to enjoy the holiday events in GTA Online again. From December 19 through January 1, there are plenty of events to participate in, as well as plenty of rewards to get your hands on. Of course, there is also the most recently added GTA Online: <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-update-agents-of-sabotage-now-available-in-gta-online/">Agents of Sabotage</a> update for you to get stuck into, which adds new decommissioned law enforcement vehicles for you to purchase, as well as a whole new HQ to make yours.</p>
<p>In today's update, there are multiple returning seasonal events for you to dive into. This includes the return of the Gooch, the Weazel Plaza Shootout, and the Yeti Hunt. By participating in these events, you can get some great rewards, such as the Yeti Outfit, the Gooch Outfit, The Snowman Outfit, and much more. Outfits aren't the only things you'll be able to get your hands on, as there is now Double Garment Factory Passive Income and Double Rewards on Pizza Deliveries and Dispatch Work if you feel that you need to make some big bucks to make it through the festive season.</p>
<p>You can also get triple the amount of GTA$ and RP by participating in Entourage (Festive Remix).

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 dock may have been designed to let the console run faster, but won't be able to output at smooth framerates at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a> allegedly has had access to the new console by Nintendo and has revealed some additional information on the system as well as on the dock and Joy-Con controller while also providing proof that their information has merit. Such proof, which includes pictures of the system's dock and the inside of a possible controller rail has also been provided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, which concluded that the leaker may be legit after talking with them as well.</p>
<p>While most of the information revealed by NextHandheld falls in line with other rumors and leaks that have been circulating online in the past few weeks, some of the information on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, which was never shown in any of the previous leaks, is new. The picture of the dock shown to The Verge shows that it has big feet around the back so that it can be placed horizontally without blocking a potential set of vents. While no one would position the dock this way, these feet may have been placed in case the dock is accidentally knocked over to prevent overheating. And if vents are included in the dock, as the leaker seems to have confirmed, albeit cryptically, then there's a very good chance the console will run faster in docked mode. In addition, the leaker revealed that the dock is rated for 60W, while the Nintendo Switch 2 for 45W, values that are considerably higher than the original model, and that it will only output<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hgikth/comment/m2mwv50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 4K resolution at 30 frames per second,</a> which would definitely be disappointing if true.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, NextHandheld also revealed plenty of other information on the Nintendo Switch 2. You can find a summary of the information shared by the leaker on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit. </a>Despite the proof the leaker has provided, we strongly suggest taking all the new information with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but there's been some chatter that its reveal could happen right after the new year begins. No matter when it is revealed and released, the console is projected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/">most successful next-generation system</a>, something that will further solidify Nintendo's position as the console market leader for the next few years.</p>
