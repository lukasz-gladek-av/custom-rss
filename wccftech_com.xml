            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-executive-says-exclusivity-will-be-considered-on-a-case-by-case-basis/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft's Xbox finally has a Game of the Year contender in a popular category such as action/adventure (or, as I called it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>, adventure/action) with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. It's a bit ironic that it launched a couple of weeks too late to be considered for The Game Awards show that goes live tomorrow.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, Microsoft and all parties involved (Bethesda, MachineGames, LucasFilm) are very happy about the great reception of the game. Speaking to Variety after the reviews hit, Xbox president of game content and studios Matt Booty also discussed the exclusivity topic, suggesting that it will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><em>We are very much making the exclusivity and windowing decisions on a game by game basis, and each of our studios is in a little bit of a different position. There’s also the production timeline on a game, so the decision on spacing comes there first. We want to make sure there’s a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between when it becomes available on PlayStation is as much a production decision as it is anything else. This is a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even.</em></p>
<p>This sounded like a partial backtrack compared to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest statement</a> that there were no 'red lines' when it came to Xbox exclusives being ported to other consoles.</p>
<p>With Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the situation was a bit more complex. As mentioned by Booty, the game started development ahead of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax. As such, it was originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-indiana-jones-game-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> not planned</a> to be an Xbox exclusive. That changed later as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-game-will-be-pc-xbox-exclusive-and-day-1-on-gp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to launch the game only on Xbox and PC to boost its Game Pass subscription service. To do so, they had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusivity-indiana-jones-made-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amend the contract</a> with Lucasfilm (and Disney).</p>
<p>However, Microsoft's stance on exclusivity toward rival consoles has changed drastically in the last few months, beginning with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ports of Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and Grounded</a>. Consequently, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle got a simultaneous <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=indiana+jones+timed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date announcement</a> for PC and Xbox and a release window for PlayStation 5, leaving some Xbox fans a bit baffled.</p>
<p>Following Spencer's statement, it seemed like there were no barriers anymore, but Booty's words leave some room for Microsoft to potentially keep some exclusives close to its chest. The general trend is clearly to maximize revenue by releasing games on as many platforms as possible, though.</p>
<p>Their next big console exclusive is Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, due to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

						<h5>Fairy Tail 2</h5><p><span>December 11th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>

			<p>Despite some of its shortcomings, such as the excessive amount of busywork for quests, guild development, and other mechanics that dragged the experience down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fairy-tail-review/">the first proper adaptation</a> of Fairy Tail in JRPG form developed by Gust managed to be rather successful, mostly thanks to the faithful rendition of the charming characters created by Hiro Mashima. Still, no one expected the game to receive a sequel, so its announcement earlier this year came as a complete surprise.</p>
<p>Adapting the Alvarez Arc, the seventeenth and final story arc of the main series, Fairy Tail 2 also attempts to address the most glaring issues of its predecessor by reducing the amount of busywork and introducing a new combat system that combines turn-based and real-time elements to feel more involving and engaging. In some ways, the changes are quite welcome and make for a snappier experience, but not every drastic change has been for the best.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241202194349_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, Fairy Tail 2 adapts the Alvarez Arc in its entirety, starting from the Fairy Tail guild's fight against Ajeel of Spriggan 12 until the final confrontation against Acnologia. To improve the narration in JRPG format, some events are moved around while others are unsurprisingly glossed over or removed altogether, but the story is exactly the same as the manga and anime at its heart, so fans of the series should expect some of its most important moments to be present in all of their glory.</p>
<p>Adapting the final story arc in a very long story, Fairy Tail 2 doesn't waste any time introducing characters as if they were appearing for the first time. Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, and every other member of the guild is a well-established character at this point, and they are only further developed if the story calls for it in some way. While this was expected, it makes the game not particularly well suited to newcomers, as right from the first few minutes, a barrage of concepts, terms, and locations are thrown at the player, with only the Terminology, which allows players to learn more about certain highlighted terms without having to go through menus, and Glossary features to help them. While these features work well for the most part, there was no way they could provide the same level of engagement or information as actually experiencing the events they summarize, and, as such, they cannot solve an issue that was essentially unsolvable, everything considered.</p>
<p>Even though newcomers to Fairy Tail will inevitably feel lost among all these references to past events and concepts they should already be familiar with at this point in the story, the Fairy Tail 2 story still manages to be engaging, thanks not only to a very fast pace which has events moving rather quickly, and the incredibly charming characters that Hiro Mashima created. While not every member of the guild has their time to shine, those that do are instantly likable, even if the player previously did not know anything about them. At the very least, Fairy Tail 2 does a very good job of getting players interested in Fairy Tail, and it wouldn't surprise me if anybody who didn't know about the series before started reading the manga or watching the anime after experiencing the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241204195006_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After completing the main campaign, Fairy Tail 2 continues with a new journey, Key to the Unknown, which comprises four additional chapters. Compared to the main campaign, the story of the extra campaign, an original tale written in collaboration with series' creator Hiro Mashima, is more lighthearted, but it's still rather enjoyable, providing some hilarious interactions between the vast majority of characters that appeared in the main campaign. At the end of the story, Key to the Unknown also somewhat ties back with the main campaign, so it is definitely worth playing for all Fairy Tails fans. The four chapters are also not particularly long and take two hours tops to play through, so it's not a major time investment, as is the entirety of the game.</p>
<p>A single playthrough of the main campaign and the extra chapters at Balanced difficulty took me around 15 hours and might have taken me even less if I didn't spend some time exploring maps to gather crystals to unlock nodes on the Magic Origin skill trees, three for each character which include passive and active combat skills, stats improvements and more. By all accounts, Fairy Tail 2 is undoubtedly a very short game, especially for a JRPG, but at least the brief playtime allowed for tight pacing that is a breath of fresh air in the genre, considering how many modern games are just padded with filler to extend the playtime.</p>
<p>While Fairy Tail 2 mostly succeeds with its portrayal of story and characters (which shouldn't have been surprising for anyone with some familiarity with the source material), the gameplay is another story. It's not bad by any means, but it's extremely basic and essentially centered on combat. Unlike its predecessor, which twisted features and mechanics from the Atelier series that did make the experience a little more varied even when adding too much busywork that got in the way of enjoyment, Fairy Tail 2 goes the opposite way. All the fluff is gone, and all we are left with is the straightforward exploration of some open-ish fields filled with enemies, items that can be exchanged to "purchase" consumables and Lacrima, special accessories that provide a variety of beneficial effects, and treasure chests. At the beginning of the game, some areas are closed off and will only become explorable later on with some abilities unlocked via story progression, but other than this, traversal and explorations are as basic as they get and pretty unexciting.</p>
<p>The game also only features a couple of towns, including Magnolia, where the Fairy Tail guild resides, but they essentially function as the open fields, and no dungeons whatsoever. Considering the story it tells, it's not surprising to see the gameplay be so constrained by it, but it's still a little disappointing, as the lack of anything meaningful to do outside of following the story, completing some boring fetch quests, collecting Plue clones scattered all over, experiencing Character Episodes at campfires, and fighting enemies, makes the entire experience rather linear and one-dimensional.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241205185056_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the experience centered around fighting enemies, the combat system, at least, does not disappoint, being one of the best features of Fairy Tail 2. Doing away with a traditional turn-based system, Gust went with a very interesting system that gives players more agency during both offense and defense. Controlling one character in a party of up to three characters, it is possible to use regular attacks to fill up an SP bar, which can be spent to use a variety of special skills that target single or multiple enemies, buff, debuff, or heal party members. Using skills also increases the Fairy Rank, and every time it does, not only does the maximum amount of SP that can be stored increase, but it also becomes possible to use more powerful Extreme Magic attacks. Using skills appropriately, it is also possible to Break enemies by depleting another gauge and unleashing Link Attacks with other uncontrolled party members, which grant some beneficial effects, and Assault Raids against enemies that have more than a single Break bar, which deal a lot of damage and grant even more beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Add the ability to guard against attacks at almost any time, elemental weakness and resistances, Support characters whose attacks are triggered by fulfilling certain conditions, Awakening mode, which increases the power of characters and lets them unleash even more powerful skills, and the ability to switch between all ten playable characters on the fly, and you get a rather dynamic combat system where changing characters constantly is the way to go. In many ways, the Fairy Tail 2 combat system feels like a more turn-based variant of the combat system of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>, so if you have mastered Remake and Rebirth's combat mechanics, you will probably feel right at home in the game.</p>
<p>From a visual and technical standpoint, Fairy Tail 2 also delivers, for the most part. While locations are not particularly well detailed, sporting average lighting, designs, and texture work, the cel-shaded character models are a joy to look at. With great animation work to boot, seeing characters in action in both cutscenes and combat feels like watching an episode of the show. The generally undemanding visuals, which are not surprising at all since the game is also releasing on Nintendo Switch, mean that most PC players shouldn't have trouble running the game at high resolution, quality setting and framerate.</p>
<p>The machine used for the test (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) had no trouble running the game at native 4K resolution, and the settings in the screenshots below at 100+ FPS most of the time. During a benchmark session held in the Clover region running around and fighting enemies, the game ran at an average of 128 FPS, 65 FPS 1% Low, with no noticeable stuttering, although there were times during my playthrough where I experienced some minor performance hiccups which didn't impact the experience in any way. Those who cannot run the game decently on their machines at high native resolution can also enable the Intel XeSS upscaler, which is, quite surprisingly, the only upscaler supported by the game at launch.</p>

<p>From its announcement, Fairy Tail 2 clearly looked like a labor of love crafted for fans already enamored with Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, and the rest of the guild, and in this regard, Gust delivered an enjoyable, albeit one-dimensional, experience. However, the game's short length and lack of meaningful side activities limit its appeal, making it hard to justify the full price for those unfamiliar with Hiro Mashima's charming characters and their adventures.</p>

			<section>
				<p>Adapting the final explosive story arc of the original story, Fairy Tail 2 is a game that goes straight to the point, featuring charming characters and a well-crafted combat system that makes fighting the forces of the Alvarez Empire incredibly fun. The lack of any involving side activity, lackluster world design and very short length, however, limit the appeal of the experience only to fans of Hiro Mashima's works, as there simply isn't enough for those who are already in love with Fairy Tail to justify a purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A great new look at the alleged Nintendo Switch 2 form factor and screen has arrived today, thanks to a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwitchUpYt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwitchUp</a> was recently sent a detailed 3D-printed mock-up of Nintendo's yet-to-be-revealed new console by a Chinese <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">case</a> manufacturer, so it is safe to assume that their accessories have been produced based on this design. In the video, the 3D-printed mock-up and Joy-Con controllers are also compared with the current OLED model and controllers, highlighting the design, screen, and feel differences.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ok So Someone Sent Us THAT Switch 2 Mock Up &amp; It’s CASE…We Have Thoughts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nacn4yqUY1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At this point, it definitely feels like we know everything about the Nintendo Switch 2 before its official announcement, as this isn't the first time we have seen a 3D-printed mock-up of the system. We also know much about what it will be capable of, thanks to the leaked specifications of the NVIDIA Tegra T239 chip that will power the system. However, it will still be interesting to see if the system will come with any feature that hasn't been leaked and how it will use those that have, such as NVIDIA DLSS, which will likely be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/">widely used in games</a> but won't be able to target 4K and the screen's native 1080p resolution output in the most demanding titles.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/">revealed</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>We're just one day away from The Game Awards 2024, Geoff Keighley's end-of-the-year ceremony that crowns the best games released throughout 2024 and also serves as a veritable hype machine for what's coming next in the industry.</p>
<p>Video Game Chronicle's Andy Robinson already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyped up this year's show</a>, and now Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has doubled down on the claim. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8_XQdX8cEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Kinda Funny videocast</a>, Schreier said:</p>
<p><em>What can I say without getting in trouble... so I know about a couple of announcements that'll be there, and they would qualify as big announcements. That said, like, big announcements are games that won't be out for years. I think there's a good chance that you'll see one or two teaser trailers for a game that is like 2026 or even later in many cases.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I mean, yeah, there are at least two things that will make you guys reacting be like holy [ __ ], like, I can't believe this thing is here. At least two things, I'll say that.</em></p>
<p>Schreier namedropped Quantic Dream's <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Eclipse</a> and Monolith's <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman</a> as the type of announcement he's referring to: very big games, but several years away from being available. Still, they should get people excited.</p>
<p>However, if you're one of those pining for a Bloodborne sequel or remaster for PlayStation 5 and PC (although emulator ShadPS4 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making great strides</a>), Schreier already axed that possibility with a brief 'It's not' post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hb95p2/comment/m1evpg7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>We do <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> for a fact that we'll be getting trailers for Take-Two's Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 at The Game Awards 2024. As a reminder, the pre-show goes live at 4:30 PM Pacific Time from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. The whole thing will last around three hours and a half, which is a bit of a nightmare for us Europeans, unfortunately.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED wasn't actually done with Cyberpunk 2077. The studio has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/514069779412157218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new update, version 2.2, which is focused on expanding customization in a number of ways.&nbsp;To start, there are over a hundred new options for protagonist V to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
<p>The Character Creator randomizer features a new Plain-to-Punk slider, too. Of course, you'll likely want to share all those new customizations with friends, and what better way to do so than leveraging the expanded Cyberpunk 2077 Photo Mode? The following options have been added and/or enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.<br>
Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Car customization was also augmented with the addition of CrystalCoat technology to several vehicle brands. CrystalCoat lets you change the car's paint job on the fly, allowing players to fool NCPD and reduce their wanted level.</p>

<figure><a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//35210272/fdebe757a2d84a897913a96320b66bf68a986bf9.gif"></a></figure>

<p>There are also some PC-specific improvements that improve Cyberpunk 2077 CPU performance on Intel Arrow Lake processors, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-cyberpunk-2077-patch-improves-intel-arrow-lake-cpu-performance-up-to-33-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> in our previous article. Lastly, CD Projekt RED teasingly added that Night City now hosts more secrets for players to discover. These are likely to be Easter eggs rather than full-fledged missions, mind.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the milestone of 30 million units sold. A sequel codenamed Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in development</a> at the newly opened North American studio, although the main focus of the company as a whole is The Witcher 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now in full production</a>.</p>
