			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the video game industry's most renowned and respected creators, tragically died this past Sunday after a fatal car crash. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-died-in-car-crash-call-of-duty-apex-legends-battlefield/">The news didn't break until yesterday</a>, and across the video game industry, game developers, players, and everyone in between have shared messages of sadness upon hearing of his death and condolences to Vince Zampella's family and loved ones.</p>



<p>Zampella was, in every way, a titan of the modern video game industry. As a co-founder of Infinity Ward and a co-creator of Call of Duty, he left an immeasurable impact and legacy on video games and the modern video game industry, though to the people he worked with and who knew him, the impact they had on their lives will be the one they remember most.</p>



<p>One of the stories shared comes from Robert Bowling, a game developer and current studio head at Weatherfoot LLC, who worked on music for Call of Duty 2, 4, Modern Warfare 2, and Modern Warfare 3. The post he shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fourzerotwo_i-loved-vince-zampella-unconditionally-and-activity-7408978227269971969-fsKG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">on his personal LinkedIn account</a> is incredibly touching and a stunning example of the kind of person Zampella was.</p>



<p><em>"He has protected me and rescued me from tragedy, when I've been at the bottom, he'd find a way to nestle up next to me there and provide the ladder to climb up. When my father passed, he asked me to stay at his house, he knew I needed a shoulder and space to share my grief. He secretly paid for my Dad's entire funeral (with full military honors). Whenever something happened in my life, Vince was the</em> <em>first text I'd receive to make sure I was okay</em>."</p>



<p>Bowling goes on to say that he, and "<em>everyone he [Zampella] ever met had countless stories like this, full of unfiltered kindness, understanding, and generosity</em>," and even from a quick look into the comments of Bowling's post, it's clear he wasn't exaggerating. Just below his story is another, more comical story of Zampella pretending to grill a colleague for a hiring decision, before letting him in on the gag.</p>



<p>Laura Miele, head of EA's Entertainment division and one of the lead executives who worked closely with Zampella, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ealaura-miele_yesterday-we-lost-vince-zampella-an-icon-activity-7409023999239970816-E3xD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on her LinkedIn</a>, "<em>He was a wickedly talented creator whose honesty, grounded approach, and sharp perspective made everyone around him better. Vince was a dear friend of mine who challenged me in the best ways and made my work more meaningful, not to mention a lot more fun. Beyond his extraordinary professional legacy, he was also a remarkable dad, which is something I deeply admired about him. I loved him dearly and will miss him more than words can say.</em>"</p>



<p>Jordan DeVires, a UI/UX designer at Respawn who worked on the Star Wars Jedi series, <a href="https://x.com/theastralj/status/2003200678253199585">said of Zampella</a>, "<em>As a creative he had my two favorite qualities: he always had an opinion and he always gave it to you straight. I wouldn't get to work on video games (let alone star wars games) if it weren't for what Vince made. My heart goes out to his loved ones and those that knew him best.</em>"</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2003400118868046169">Hideo Kojima also shared his own story of Zampella</a>, providing a bit of insight into the relationship they shared, and how Zampella reached out to Kojima when he was starting his own independence journey and opening Kojima Productions. </p>



<p>"<em>I first met Vince during his time at Infinity Ward, when he and Jason were creating “COD: MW2.” After they were forced out of Infinity Ward, Vince went on to found Respawn. When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways. He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures. I honestly don’t have the words. It’s far too soon. This is heartbreaking. R.I.P. Vince.</em>" </p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada stepped in to add, "<em>I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Vince Zampella. He was a creator who reshaped modern gaming and left an indelible mark on the industry through his vision, leadership, and commitment to quality. His work set new standards for competitive play and player experience, influencing countless developers across genres.</em>" Harada continued to say that he would find himself playing games Zampella worked on for hours into the night, even when he was busy trying to make his own games. "<em>Proof of how compelling and inspiring his work truly was</em>."</p>



<p>Alex Frostwolf, a community lead on <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">the upcoming multiplayer title Highguard</a>, who previously worked on Apex Legends and Overwatch, <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2003222453066039663">added</a>, "<em>While most knew him as the co-creator of Call of Duty and head of Respawn, I had the great fortune of also witnessing his particular brand of leadership, which often included standing up for what he believed in over politics, and protecting his people. The embodiment of a legend if I ever saw one. The industry has suffered a deep loss with this tragedy. My love and sympathy go out to his family. Thank you for everything, Vince</em>."</p>



<p>These are just a handful of messages that have been shared since the news of Zampella's passing was made public. It's clear that his loss is one the video game industry will not wholly recover from, and that the industry is now worse off without him in it. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones.</p>

            <guid>1391230</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Chris Roberts</strong>, the video game designer known for the Wing Commander series and most recently for <strong>Star Citizen</strong>, penned his usual end-of-the-year <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Letter From the Chairman'</a> to the SC community, including a few updates on <strong>Squadron 42</strong>.</p>



<p>The single player campaign was initially supposed to launch its beta in <strong>Q2 2020</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-beta-delayed-by-three-months-now-targeting-q3-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then in <strong>Q3 2020</strong></a>, before being delayed indefinitely, with Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-will-be-done-when-its-done-says-chris-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting in October 2020</a> that the game would be 'done when it's done'. </p>



<p>The tune finally changed in October 2023, when developer Cloud Imperium Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Squadron 42 was now <strong>feature-complete</strong> and would enter its polishing phase. A year later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the new target release window: <strong>2026</strong>. However, a few months ago, the game's Content Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that delays could still happen.</p>



<p>Today, though, Chris Roberts has reiterated that Squadron 42 is on the right path toward the Beta milestone and the eventual launch at some point next year. According to Roberts, the game will take <strong>over forty hours</strong> to complete. The game designer also teased that the content quality is something he's proud of, from writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his previous statement</a> about hoping to attract a GTA 6-like attention, Roberts has now said that Cloud Imperium Games isn't planning a long marketing campaign. Because of this decision, fans should expect to learn more about the game relatively close to its actual debut compared to most triple-A games.</p>



<p>The plot of Squaron 42 will see the player character in the role of a rookie pilot joining the celebrated 42nd Squadron, a naval combat unit deployed aboard the massive capital ship UEES Stanton, assigned to the 5th Fleet, 87th Battlegroup in the Odin system, during the Events of Vega II in 2945. The story is framed as a military war narrative centered on the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy, where the player is thrown into a hazardous campaign to combat a sinister pirate threat and the alien Vanduul.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games recruited <strong>major Hollywood talents</strong>, including <strong>Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Gillian Anderson, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham, John Rhys-Davies, Henry Cavill, and Ben Mendelsohn</strong>, to play the role of key non-player characters in the game. Cloud Imperium used new 4D technology to create digital replicas of these actors (as well as player characters and other NPCs) thanks to a unique partnership with the Hollywood VFX company <a href="https://www.clearanglestudios.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clear Angle Studios</a>.</p>



<p>In the 'Letter From The Chairman', Roberts also boasted that Star Citizen received many big updates this year, driving record engagement with the game up to <strong>64 million hours</strong> (last year, CIG registered 48 million hours of playtime) played in 2025. Looking ahead, the Dynamic Server Meshing technology will evolve to reconfigure in real-time, aiming to support thousands of players in a single shared instance; a next-generation planetary tech will debut, offering significantly higher graphical fidelity, denser biomes, and natural ecosystems; a new AI population management system will create more complex and appropriate NPC interactions; and significant improvements are also coming to systems like Inventory, Insurance, and Cross-Patch Persistence.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[We Almost Could’ve Had Grand Theft Auto Games Set in Tokyo, Istanbul, Rio De Janeiro, and Moscow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-istanbul-moscow-rio-de-janeiro-rockstar/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Grand Theft Auto series is known for always being set in a fictional version of cities in the United States. Liberty City is Rockstar's version of New York, Vice City is Miami, Los Santos is Los Angeles, and so on. At the core of the series has always been its parody of US culture, which is part of why each game has remained in the US. That said, according to a former Rockstar developer, we were close to seeing an entirely different version of the GTA games we've come to know.</p>



<p>In fact, we were close to seeing several different versions of GTA games, with one intended to be set in Tokyo, another in Istanbul, another in Rio de Janeiro, and another in Moscow. This all comes from Obbe Vermeij, a former technical director at Rockstar and the technical director for GTA III, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA VI, in <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">an interview with GamesHub</a>. </p>



<p>When asked if the development team at Rockstar ever considered taking the GTA games out of the US, Vermeij said, "<em>There were desires, yeah, but it’s like talking about alternative projects at Rockstar when you really start thinking about it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end.</em> <em>People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work</em>."</p>



<p>When asked about the prospect of Grand Theft Auto games moving to Europe, Vermeij continued, "<em>It’s just not realistic. I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you’re not going to get that when there’s a GTA every 12 years.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You’re not going to set it in a new location. You don’t really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they’re not going to play GTA VI because they’ve already played Vice City. That doesn’t make sense. It’s completely different.</em> <em>They’ll revisit New York again. They’ll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas. I’m afraid we’re stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let’s just get used to it.</em>"</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is returning to Vice City and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">is due to release on November 19, 2026</a>. It's been over a decade since the release of GTA V, and considering how long it is taking to get GTA VI out the door, it'll be years before we even start to hear rumours about where the series could go next.</p>



<p>In other Rockstar news, while everyone continues to wait for GTA VI, the studio is currently being accused of union-busting for the firing of 34 workers across Rockstar offices in the UK and Canada. While Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">claims the employees were leaking confidential information</a>, the 31 workers fired across the UK and three workers fired at Rockstar Toronto deny those allegations.</p>



<p>The dismissals have resulted in Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">employees and union supporters protesting outside of Rockstar's offices</a> in Edinburgh, Paris, New York, and, most recently, Toronto. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech was able to attend the protest in Toronto and speak with those protesting</a> and get a first-hand account of Rockstar's refusal to speak with those at its office in Oakville, Ontario, that day. </p>



<p>Wccftech also spoke with one of the workers who was fired from Rockstar Toronto, who told us, "<em></em><em>Every single one of us was talented;</em> <em>we wouldn't have gotten into Rockstar if we weren't talented, if they didn't see our potential, if they didn't see how talented and how good we are at what we do, we wouldn't have gotten in in the first place. We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>
