			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a well-optimized game, so much so that the most powerful GPU now available on the market, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">NVIDIA RTX 5090</a>, can run the game at 16K resolution and playable framerates with the help of DLSS.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zWORMzGaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zWORMz Gaming</a> shows the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios running at 16K resolution, low settings, and NVIDIA DLSS at the Performance setting, meaning it is upscaled from 8K resolution. Despite not running at native resolution, it is still impressive to see the RTX 5090 handle such a high resolution relatively well, as the above 30 FPS the GPU can deliver makes the game more than playable. Unsurprisingly, the RTX 5090 is not capable of handling Kingdom Come: Deliverance II running at native 16K resolution, as it only delivers a proper slideshow experience with a whopping 3 FPS gameplay.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II isn't only among the most well-optimized games of recent times, it is also a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, as Chris highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI is close to making its debut on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but its release on Nintendo Switch 2 remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetERA forums, NateDrake, a.k.a. NatheTheHate, who proved to be a very reliable source in the past, recently revealing precisely when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">Nintendo Switch 2 would get officially unveiled last month</a>, said that, barring any late changes, Final Fantasy XVI will<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> soon be announced for Xbox consoles</a>, and will be released around the mid-first half of the year, so around Spring. Final Fantasy VII Remake will also be released on Xbox consoles <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later this year</a>, and Rebirth next year. The Xbox release of all three games will be announced at the same time for maximum impact, according to the insider.</p>
<p>While Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S owners will soon be able to finally experience Final Fantasy XVI, Nintendo Switch 2 owners, on the other hand, may never get the chance. According to NateDrake, the game is<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135347844" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> not planned</a> for the next Nintendo console at this time, as Square Enix decided to prioritize Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth for the console. Considering how the game has trouble running with decent performance on PlayStation 5 and even on certain PC configurations, it wouldn't be surprising if not getting the game out on much weaker hardware was due to technical reasons.</p>
<p>Of the three Final Fantasy games mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the latest. Launched last year on PlayStation 5 and last month on PC, it is among the best entries in the entire franchise to date, and a massive step forward from Remake, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member.1101696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Layoffs have hit another PlayStation studio, though it is not a game development team but a software development team. The news was reported by Oscar Diaz, Senior Design Technologist at PlayStation since October 2020, where he worked on 'Building tools and processes that help the UX group at PlayStation push the boundaries of play.' Diaz, one of the affected employees, <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@whoisryosuke/113953245919633944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Mastodon</a>:</p>
<p><em>Most of my team was just laid off from PlayStation. It was a dream to get to work with Sony on the platform I'd grown up playing since the PS1 and contribute to the PS5, Portal, PSVR2, PS App, and future consoles. If you know anyone who needs an engineer experienced with native console UI, feel free to reach out.</em></p>
<p>Sony's PlayStation division has recently laid off several employees, including some at Sony Bend following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of their live service project</a> (which got canceled alongside a God of War live service game in development at Bluepoint). A few months ago, we reported on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a> of Firewalk, maker of the live service Concord game, and Neon Koi, which was going to port PlayStation franchises to mobile devices. Earlier in 2024, around a year ago, PlayStation <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut 8% of its total workforce</a>, shutting down the London studio and even laying off employees at acclaimed studios like Guerrilla Games, Naughty Dog, and Insomniac Games. In July 2024, PlayStation subsidiary Bungie laid off 220 employees, too.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far from a PlayStation-specific issue. 2024 was terrible across the whole industry, and 2025 isn't shaping up to be any better. Layoffs <a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-developer-hit-with-layoffs-after-games-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit Reflector Entertainment</a> after the failure of Unknown 9: Awakening, and the same goes for Phoenix Labs, developer of Dauntless and Fae Farm, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to let go of most of the studio</a>. BioWare was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrunk down to less than a hundred employees</a> following the commercial underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off 185 employees</a>, including the shutdown of the Leamington studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/paradox-interactive-has-acquired-haemimont-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Paradox Interactive <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-acquires-haemimont-games,c4101380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a binding agreement to acquire formerly independent developer Haemimont Games, which will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradox. The current leadership and team will remain active with the studio, and the studio’s ongoing projects will remain in development. The acquisition consists of an upfront cash payment and a similar sized performance-based earn-out to be paid over the coming years. Haemimont Games and Paradox have agreed not to disclose the purchase price at this time. The acquisition will be financed with cash on hand and is expected to close within a few days.</p>
<p>Haemimont Games is headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria. Over the years, they've made games in several different genres, though most of them were in the strategy and simulation niche. Haemimont released Tropico 3, 4, and 5, the city-building game Surviving Mars, the action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/victor-vran-overkill-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Vran</a>, the survival simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranded-alien-dawn-leaves-early-access-on-april-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranded: Alien Dawn</a>, and most recently, the well-received tactical roleplaying game Jagged Alliance 3, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/jagged-alliance-3-unexpendables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received an 8.5 score here on Wccftech</a>.</p>
<p>Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are very happy to welcome Haemimont Games to Paradox! They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox’s way of working. We have strong faith in their team and leadership, and our main focus now is to ensure that they can continue to create great games under new ownership.</em></p>
<p>Gabriel Dobrev, Founder of Haemimont Games, added:</p>
<p><em>We're delighted to become a part of the Paradox family! The cultural fit between our companies is remarkable, and we already feel at home. This partnership empowers us to push the boundaries of our games, delivering deeper and more intense experiences to our players. It also opens new horizons for our team, technology, and creative processes, which we're eager to explore. Expect amazing new games from us!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/2k-removes-31st-union-president-michael-condrey-insists-project-ethos-is-still-being-worked-on/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>2K Games has removed Michael Condrey, founder and president of developer 31st Union, from his position within the studio. The news comes&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Kotaku</a>, which also says the main reason is the lack of player interest in their debut title, Project ETHOS, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-announces-project-ethos-a-new-f2p-third-person-hero-shooter-with-roguelike-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unveiling in October 2024</a>.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean 2K is shutting down the studio or the game. A spokesperson told Kotaku:</p>
<p><em>We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion, and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union. Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.</em></p>
<p>Michael Condrey was the Game Director (alongside Bret Robbins, who recently made <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-director-says-sales-have-improved-lately-story-isnt-written-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>) in Visceral's acclaimed Dead Space. Later, he co-founded Sledgehammer Games with fellow Dead Space creator Glen Schofield, where he worked on multiple Call of Duty games. For example, he directed 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-wwii-a-shot-away-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty WWII</a>. Later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined 2K to found 31st Union</a> in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>As for Project ETHOS, the game was described as a free-to-play third-person hero shooter mixed with roguelike elements. These come in the form of Evolutions, powerful semi-randomized upgrades that are unique to each Hero. Evolutions can transform a sniper into a melee skirmisher or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. The roguelike elements mean that players take on the competition with new skills, stakes, and challenges every time they play, according to 31st Union.</p>
<p>The game will also include an extraction mode called Trials, which was described as an ongoing, persistent battle to collect cores, extract and unlock powerful Augments. There's also a built-in risk versus reward mechanic where players can either play it safe with the cores or risk everything to get to the top spot.</p>
