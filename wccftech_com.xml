			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the tactical role-playing game developed by Necrosoft Games and published by Ysbryd Games, will launch next month on PC and consoles after being delayed indefinitely last year.</p>



<p>As announced during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan, the game will launch on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Serie S, and Nintendo Switch. To celebrate the announcement, a new short trailer was also shared, showcasing some of the fifteen playable characters, all with unique fighting styles, the game's retro graphics, the battle system, and more. You can find the trailer below.</p>

<p>Demonschool has been in development for quite some time, and at one point, it looked like work on the game had stopped.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/">Last year</a>, however, the game was relaunched with a playable demo that did an amazing job showcasing its unique premise and, most of all, its excellent battle system. You can learn more about it in my preview.</p>



<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>



<p>Demonschool launches on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
