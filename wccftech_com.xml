			<p>With <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> massive organizational shake-up and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong><em>"major reset</em></strong>"</a> officially revealed last month, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">a lot of changes at the company</a>. Even before it was properly revealed, though, big changes had been made, with the establishment of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong> and the departure of the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, we learned who would be replacing Côté, with three veteran Assassin's Creed developers <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM">at the helm of the franchise</a> for the foreseeable future. The first is the new head of the brand, <strong>Martin Schelling,</strong> who has been with Ubisoft since 2003. He has worked on the AC series since <strong>AC: Revelations,</strong> where he was a producer. He was also a producer on <strong>AC IV: Black Flag</strong>, and then a senior producer on <strong>AC: Origins</strong> and <strong>AC: Valhalla</strong>. He moved further up the ladder since then and was most recently the chief production officer under the old organizational structure.</p>



<p>Second, is <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, who has been named the head of content for the Assassin's Creed brand. Fans of the series may recognize Guesdon as the creative director behind both AC IV: Black Flag and AC: Origins. After 17 years with Ubisoft, he left the company in 2018 to become an advisor at Classcraft and then moved to <strong>Behavior Interactive</strong> to be the studio's senior creative director. That only lasted a year, and in 2024, he came back to Ubisoft to take on the director of strategic visualization role, before now becoming the head of content for the entire AC brand.</p>



<p>Last but not least is <strong>François de Billy</strong>, who will become the head of production excellence in this new structure. He has remained with Ubisoft since 2001, where he initially worked on the first <strong>Splinter Cell</strong> game on the original Xbox. He's also been with the AC series since its beginnings, working as a production manager on the first AC game, associate producer on <strong>AC II</strong>, and as production manager on AC IV: Black Flag, AC: Origins, and AC: Valhalla. His most recent role has been the global senior production director, which he has held since 2021.</p>

<p>"<em>It is wonderful to be back after all these years. Assassin’s Creed has been a defining part of my professional life and being back feels like coming home. This universe, these characters, these worlds, and of course the community have always meant so much to me</em>," said Guesdon in a post shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/">Assassin's Creed Reddit page</a> from Ubisoft's official account.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m&nbsp;especially grateful to be sharing this journey with all of you&nbsp;again, and&nbsp;look forward to sharing more about the next steps ahead for the franchise.</em> <em>Until then...Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted</em>"</p>



<p>For all of Ubisoft's recent woes, the Assassin's Creed brand remains its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">biggest driver of revenue</a> during its current troubles. Placing the franchise in the hands of three people who clearly have a lot of familiarity with it, including one person who was a key member in creating one of the most beloved entries in the series, should point to a brighter future for both Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed. That's the hope, at least.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> points to the latest source of video game industry layoffs, this time coming from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-reached-record-sales-generating-10-billion-in-revenue/">Tencent</a></strong> and its <strong>TiMi Montreal </strong>studio. In this case, the <strong>whole studio</strong> is getting <strong>shut down</strong>, leading to everyone on the team seemingly losing their roles nearly <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/TiMi-Studio-Group-Opening-Game-Development-Studio-in-Montreal">five years after the studio was founded</a> with the intention of creating "<em>AAA open-world multi-platform games</em>."</p>



<p>Game File's report comes after a now-deleted LinkedIn post from one of the studio's programmers shared that the studio had been shuttered, with employees having been aware of the situation "<em>for some time</em>." They also added that they are "<em>genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing</em>."</p>



<p>Tencent and TiMi Group have not yet commented on the closure, nor has anything surfaced regarding what the Montreal-based studio was working on beyond its initial disclosure that it would look to make "<em>a AAA open world, service-focused video game for players to explore across multiple platforms</em>."</p>



<p>What we did know about the studio was that it was led by the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent"><strong>Ashraf Ismail</strong>,</a> who was fired from <strong>Ubisoft</strong> following an investigation into misconduct allegations.</p>



<p>This is now the latest bit of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoff news </a>from the video game industry in 2026, and the fourth studio shut down this year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/"><strong>PlayStation's </strong>shuttering of<strong> Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, Ubisoft's shuttering of its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax Studio</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"><strong>Hasbro's </strong>shuttering of its <strong>Atomic Arcade</strong> team</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Report Claims No One, Not Even Those Internally at Xbox, Liked the “Everything is an Xbox” Strategy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-phil-spencer-no-one-liked-everything-is-an-xbox-strategy/</link>
            <guid>1443883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday, the video games industry, and more specifically, <strong>Xbox </strong>and <strong>Microsoft</strong>, entered a new era. <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/">A post-<strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> era</a>, with the announcement of Spencer's retirement and Bond's resignation. Former Microsoft CoreAI chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/"><strong>Asha Sharma</strong>,</a> took Spencer's place, while <strong>Matt Booty</strong> stepped into a new role as Xbox's chief content officer.</p>



<p>As the industry and consumers wrap their heads around the sudden shake-up, a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">The Verge</a> looks to provide some insight into why it happened the way it did. Why is Sarah Bond leaving Microsoft instead of being <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">the one to replace Phil Spencer?</a> What does this new leadership mean for Xbox's future and its whole 'everything is an Xbox' initiative? Well, according to The Verge, the answer to those questions begins and ends with Sarah Bond and her departure.</p>



<p>Bond is pinpointed as the one who was pushing Xbox's 'Play Everywhere' campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/">more than anyone else</a>, and that its 'This is an Xbox' marketing strategy was the result of a few key people leaving Microsoft, leaving Bond directly in charge of the platform's marketing team. When the new campaign started to air, and those loyal to the platform on the consumer side were taken aback and even offended by it, they weren't the only ones.</p>



<p>The report claims that the campaign "<strong><em>offended many Xbox employees internally</em></strong>," and that the pivot away from a dedicated console to a broader approach focused on cloud and mobile was something that Bond championed under Spencer. It also adds that Bond's departure comes as a relief to employees remaining at Xbox, who claimed that she was "<em>tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn't follow the vision or questioned it, <strong>you were out</strong></em>." </p>



<p>That said, she was still praised by her colleagues for the ability to get big deals across the finish line, including the "<em><strong>crucial</strong></em>" role she played in securing the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a></strong> deal. But that's about all the praise the report mentions for Bond. </p>



<p>Everywhere else, she's reported to be the one behind Xbox's devaluing of its own hardware, and now that she and Spencer are out, Sharma's job is to usher in "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," which seems to include major changes and the admittance that what the team had been trying has not been working. </p>



<p>According to sources from the report, when it became clear that Bond's strategy under Spencer wasn't working after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">declining hardware sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenues-see-113-million-decline-amid-hardware-sales-drop-and-limited-gaming-content-and-services-growth/">Xbox revenue dropping</a>, staff believed that the departures felt inevitable. </p>



<p>The report also adds that the author has "<em>the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox, as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands</em>." Again, that's just a feeling the writer has based on their conversations with their sources at Xbox, but it's a more positive one than coming away from those talks with the feeling that Sharma is really here to start cutting away at Xbox to make more room for <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">Microsoft's AI push</a>.</p>



<p>As much as this report sets the blame at Bond's feet, where it may very well deserve to rest, the buck stops with Phil Spencer before it stops with her. In a company as big as Microsoft, you'll almost never be able to say that someone acted alone in their mistakes; there's almost always someone else complicit to them. </p>



<p>If this report is accurate in its claims that Sharma's tenure will turn over a new leaf for Xbox, then the test of that commitment to players will likely come with the reveal of the next major first-party Xbox title, and whether or not it is actually a game exclusive to Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Every Time They Buy a Game From Us, They’re Getting a Great Deal’: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Publisher Pushes Back Against Regular Price Hikes]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few months, video gaming has become a rather expensive hobby, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hardware</strong></a> and game prices rising consistently, risking pricing out more and more gamers as the worldwide economic situation remains challenging. However, not every publisher is set to increase prices, and some, like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong>  publisher <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive</strong>, are set to continue employing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pricing strategy</strong> that is respectful of gamers' money and time.</p>



<p>Speaking with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive's CEO Alexis Garavaryan</strong> commented on the company's pricing strategy, which has <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"kind of taken the opposite action"</em> to what most major publishers have done in recent years.</p>



<p>Elaborating further, <strong>Garavaryan</strong> said: <em>"When we decide on a release and when we price our video games, we try to think what do we think the price should be and then we price it lower so that when players buy a game from us they feel like they're getting a bargain. We want them to feel like we are respectful of their money, respectful of their time and that fundamentally every time they buy a game from us they're getting a great deal."</em></p>



<p><em>"We're excited for players to be able to play five, six different experiences with the same amount of money than a traditional AAA game would bring them,"</em> <strong>Kepler Interactive CEO</strong> concluded, delivering <strong>a small ray of hope</strong> amidst the general <strong>price hikes</strong> that show no sign of stopping.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Clair Obscur’s publisher on challenging game prices | BBC News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHu37zviJIg?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the smashing success of <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong>, whose art style is so convincing that some <strong>authorities in the Middle East</strong> believed the game's artbook <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-art-direction-is-so-authentic-it-triggered-a-national-antiquities-investigation/"><strong>belonged in a museum</strong></a>, <strong>Kepler Interactive's</strong> strategy has a high chance to make many of the games it will publish in the future quite popular. </p>



<p>While reaching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>same level of popularity</strong></a> as the game developed by <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> will be a tall order, gamers have shown time and time again how they are willing to embrace all sorts of gaming experiences if they are of <strong>high quality</strong> and are <strong>priced accordingly</strong>. Hopefully, other publishers will follow suit and prevent video games from becoming something only a few can enjoy.</p>
