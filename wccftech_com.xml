			<p>A few days ago, during <strong>AMD</strong>'s Q4 earnings call, CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong> shared some comments on the launches of <strong>Microsoft's Xbox Next Gen console</strong> and <strong>Valve's Steam Machine</strong>. When it comes to the Steam Machine, she said <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve was on track to launch it in early 2026</a>; however, in the span of a few hours, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-actually-gets-slight-delay-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Steam users</a> that <strong>it had to delay finalizing the shipping schedule and pricing</strong> due to the ongoing RAM shortage.</p>



<p>Regarding the Xbox Next Gen hardware, Lisa Su <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated that it was tracking well for a launch at some point next year</a></strong>. However, it appears that she was once again a little more eager than the client might have wanted. Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published a report</a> citing that Microsoft sources were a little surprised at her comment, as <strong>there is no hard commitment to 2027 yet</strong>. It is when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would like to launch the console</a>, but there's still work to do before committing to next year. In Su's defense, it's not on the hardware side, at least according to Windows Central. Instead, Microsoft wants to ensure that the underlying operating system and interface are as polished as needed. As such, Windows Central reckons 2027 is currently a "best case scenario".</p>



<p>This is because much of Microsoft's vision for the Xbox Next Gen console hinges on successfully merging the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) sides. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The first step was the Xbox handheld</a>, but there's a lot more that needs to be done. The console will start in Xbox "mode" with a console-like interface, but <strong>users can apparently "exit" to full-fledged Windows 11 whenever they want and run basically any program there</strong>. Furthermore, just as on regular Windows, Xbox users will be able to get games from other PC stores, such as Steam or the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Given this approach, it's perhaps not much of a surprise to learn that the Xbox Next Gen console will feature Microsoft's vision when it comes to specs and pricing, but <strong>other OEM partners like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS</a> or Lenovo could come up with their own versions that are either more or less powerful (and consequently more or less expensive) than Microsoft's official Xbox</strong>. </p>



<p>The report doesn't share much on the Xbox Next Gen console's pricing, other than Microsoft <strong>seemingly targeting a more premium offering</strong> (they did, after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise the largest technical leap to date</a>). The ongoing memory shortages, as well as US tariffs, are making it hard to pin down pricing at this point.</p>



<p>Still, it sounds like Microsoft itself isn't too worried if the launch price is a little high, because cross-generation with the current consoles is expected to continue for even longer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than the last time</a>. This means <strong>users could continue playing their Xbox Series S or X for years before any exclusive Xbox Next Gen games are released</strong>. </p>

			<p>The announcement of the highly anticipated <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this week's <strong>State of Play</strong></a> broadcast, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/post-151055929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider shinobi602</a>, but it will be relatively soon, and the same goes for the game's release; <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/page-7#post-151057333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>both are "not too far off"</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's now been more than two and a half years since we first heard that Ubisoft was crafting an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The original rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from Kotaku</a>, which also reported that <strong>Ubisoft Singapore</strong>, the studio behind the Black Flag-inspired game <strong>Skull and Bones</strong>, was likely involved in the development.</p>



<p>The next big confirmation came from an unlikely source: the actor who played protagonist Edward Kenway. <strong>Matt Ryan</strong>, the actor best known for playing <strong>DC's John Constantine</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically told a fan at a signing event that the remake was coming</a>. Later, he would say that Ubisoft <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened him with a lawsuit unless he shut up about it</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, last September, French website Jeux Vidéo Magazine shared the first actual info on the remake. Ubisoft reportedly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut off the boring modern-day sections of the original game (in which players took the role of an unnamed Abstergo research analyst) and added more quests and content to explore as Edward Kenway</a></strong>. Furthermore, the report said moving from land to ship and vice versa would now be seamless.</p>



<p>In late November, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed that Ubisoft was targeting March 2026</a>, right before the end of the fiscal year, for the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The announcement appeared imminent when the European game rating board, PEGI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new classification for a game titled <strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, the game was included <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a list of titles that were delayed as part of Ubisoft's "major reset"</a>, while the publisher also cancelled another highly anticipated remake, <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</strong>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-gonna-cancel-it-like-you-canceled-sands-of-time-ubisofts-reply-to-new-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-leak-draws-ire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made fans worried the same fate could befall the Black Flag remake</a>, but based on Shinobi602's information, that shouldn't happen. In fact, it shouldn't be long until we can play it.</p>
