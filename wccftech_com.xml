			<p>Diving into <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> Part One "Bloom," I had a lot of high hopes. I love story-based games where you have to make decisions that will have consequences later down the line. The aesthetic of this game also really pulled me in. I love games that have that retro feel and are full of neon vibrancy that is reminiscent of the 90s. Despite being neon, it has a beautiful muted feel to it at times and really provides the grittiness and dated feel to help you travel back in time.</p>
<p>Loading the game for the first time, you're immediately pulled into a gritty cutscene, giving you glimpses of the events that took place that summer. As soon as that unraveled before me, my interest was peaked. It slows right down quickly soon after that, as you play as Swann gets a phone call from her mother. Examining items in the car, I immediately noticed the masks and became very aware that it took place during the pandemic, a time I would much rather forget. For those who had a difficult time during the pandemic, this game may prove to be a little bit uncomfortable at times, with the reminders that crop up throughout the story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_3efe444163d418f162a8ec19c4a7039c444b93e2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After the scene in the car, you are introduced to Swann as a teenager who loves to film everything she can with her camcorder. This was something that I spent a lot of time doing. Getting to see the environments through the camcorder was a lot of fun and very nostalgic. It also reminded me a lot of Life is Strange, and the collectibles being in the form of photographs. Instead, you would film a bunch of scenes of life happening around Velvet Cove to create a memoir. Whether this was birds, items moving in place, or your gang of friends, there were lots of optional memoirs to create alongside the story-based ones.</p>
<p>What really helped elevate the game's aesthetic was the art style that went with it. While music played an important part in the game, having the color schemes of the 90s helped bring the game to life. I loved the lighting that was used to reflect off of objects in the world, as well as the characters. Seeing Nora, Kat, Autumn, and Swann bathed in neon lights was one of my favorite aspects of the game, and it made me happy to see that a photo mode had been implemented into Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>
<p>Getting to examine items from around the world, such as the books and videotapes in Swann's bedroom, helped me remember my own childhood and fond memories of mixtapes, CDs, and videotapes. I loved the amount of detail that went into every little thing that you could examine. Whether it was a beer bottle in the park or a book in Swann's room, there was so much detail, and love poured into this game to help provide a true, immersive experience in the 90s. Every recording helped to build the world up further, as well as provide beneficial evidence in tough situations.</p>
<p>While the game is quite a slow burn, it helps set up the story for the second episode, which I am eagerly awaiting. There's a lot of unanswered questions, and I'm excited to see where this supernatural tale will end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_a1c06cd0be3234b375eaad5c44662135aee55a08.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That being said, there were moments in Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage that were a little awkward. With games that rely on your choices impacting the story, there are often a lot of pauses to allow you time to respond. However, in this game, the conversations feel a little bit too drawn out, even when I'm not actively contributing to the conversation. Pauses are long, and conversations often overlap. While this would make sense since it's a group of people all talking to each other, sometimes the option to give a response comes in a bit too late, and it feels wrong to contribute to the conversation. I found this to be an issue predominantly with Swann, as she is quite an awkward teenager and is very nervous around people.</p>
<p>In addition to this, some of the animations for the conversations were a little bit wonky. For example, when you finally meet up with Autumn at the bar in Velvet Cove, sometimes you can hear the voice-over of the conversation that is taking place, but her mouth isn't moving. Alternatively, her mouth moves after a delay, and she only says half of the sentence or after it has already been said. While these issues were relatively minor, they did break the game's immersion and lessen the impact of conversations, as it became something I focused on.</p>
<p>Although it's to be expected, I did wish that the game had a save option rather than relying solely on autosaves. Because of this, it meant that saves were pretty few and far between, meaning I had to commit to some beefy gaming sessions to make progress in the story, as well as having to get to a certain point before the game was saved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, getting to experience the conversations between the girls was a lot of fun and reminded me a lot of my own childhood and adolescence, just without the supernatural elements to go along with it. The game is very aesthetically pleasing, and there is a ton of optional content that you can do within the time frame of playing the main game due to the function of the camcorder.</p>
<p>Certain parts did feel a little bit drawn out, especially the scene of Swann and Autumn collecting Autumn's keys. A lot of that scene was Swann and Autumn reminiscing on the past and how they became friends at that very moment. Despite that, it felt like it ran on longer than it needed to, which really added to the slow-burn effect of walking through their adolescence.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/">playing as adults</a>, it felt like it progressed a bit quicker, and the scenes in adulthood weren't as long as those in adolescence. I look forward to seeing how this story will conclude in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second tape</a>, and I hope I get to hunt for more collectibles again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has long been speculated when the time would come for generative AI models to be widely used in game development to actually create gameplay, and it seems like that time is coming with Muse, an Xbox one-of-a-kind AI model that was unveiled today.</p>
<p>Presented today on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>, Muse is a generative AI model that can essentially generate gameplay based on visuals or players' controller actions, understanding a 3D game world and physics and reacting to how players interact with a game. The model was trained on human gameplay data from Ninja Theory's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/">Bleeding Edge</a>, giving it access to the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, a close collaboration that gave Microsoft Research the chance to understand what needs to be in place for the model and how to access a large amount of gameplay data.</p>
<p>However, Xbox's Muse AI model is still in the early stages of development. It can only generate gameplay visuals at a very low resolution of 300 x 180, so it will be some time before it can be used for anything practical. At the same time, Microsoft stresses that it will never be used to replace actual game developers but only empower them, as it can be used, for example, in the early stages of development. Something that is really hard to believe, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">sad state of the video games industry.</a></p>
<p>In addition to aiding in new game development, Xbox's Muse AI model could also be used to improve classic games and bring them to modern consoles, according to Phil Spencer. These models and their ability to learn how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on original hardware will provide new opportunities for game preservation, according to the Microsoft Gaming CEO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-address-biggest-isssues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite what the live service push announced some time ago, PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst is reportedly not forcing teams to develop live service games.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great"> Push Square</a>, former PlayStation Studios CEO Shuhei Yoshida spoke with Sacred Symbols+ about the now infamous live service push that has yet to produce any result, saying that, to his knowledge, first-party studios are not being forced by current CEO Hermen Hulst to develop live service games, although the big initiative did in some way push studios to work on this type of game. According to Yoshida-san, when studios see the company has a big initiative, riding on it gives them a better chance to get a project approved and supported.</p>
<p>Among the games that were part of the PlayStation Studios' live service push but were eventually canceled was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-online-devs-tease-their-canceled-game-it-was-the-highlight-of-my-career/">The Last of Us Online</a>. During the interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacerd Symbols+</a>, Shuhei Yoshida confirmed he had played the game and that it was great. However, after a conversation with Bungie, Naughty Dog realized they couldn't support a live service game and work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Project</a> at the same time, so they canceled the project to focus on the single-player game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, PlayStation Studios' live service push has yet to produce any results. Last year's Concord was a complete failure, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">going offline shortly after launch</a>, while other projects that were part of the initiative, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War game by Bluepoint</a>, have been canceled.</p>
