			<p>Borderlands 4 will launch two weeks earlier than originally announced, Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted video, which was saved and shared again on X by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a>, Gearbox's CEO confirmed that the game's development is going incredibly well, so much so that it will now be released on September 12th instead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">September 23rd</a>. Randy Pitchford added at the end of the video that the previously announced State of Play presentation focused on the game is also coming "imminently," so an official announcement shouldn't be too far away. [<strong>UPDATE</strong> - The State of Play presentation will air tomorrow, April 30th, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(Randy Pitchford jumpscare) Borderlands 4 is moving its release date up to September 12th (though he deleted this video/post because it went up too early apparently) <a href="https://t.co/ILuijVDcaL">pic.twitter.com/ILuijVDcaL</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the news of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than anticipated is, by itself, excellent news, it is also great news for Grand Theft Auto VI. Publisher Take-Two Interactive previously confirmed that the sixth entry in the Rockstar Games series would launch after Gearbox Software's game, so there's a good chance Borderlands 4's release date has been moved forward in preparation for the Fall 2024 launch of what is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of all time. If this is the case, there's a very good chance that another Grand Theft Auto VI trailer will be shown soon, though a former Rockstar Games developer thinks <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">it wouldn't be necessary</a>, as the surprise factor could make the game's release even more successful.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th.</p>

			<p>Straight4 Studios has announced that its upcoming sim racing game, Project Motor Racing, will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>At launch, Project Motor Racing will feature more than 70 vehicles across 10 racing classes and 27 track layouts. Straight4 Studios also showcased some gameplay in a new trailer released today, showing off some early, but still impressive, footage.</p>
<p>The trailer also included a cameo from professional racer Derek Bell, playing the game with a full <a href="https://wccftech.com/genesis-announces-the-seaborg-400-racing-wheel-controller/">racing sim setup</a>. It's a clear sign of the kinds of players that Project Motor Racing is targeting: the sim racing fan who went all-out to play their favorite kinds of games in the best way possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMerxYOaOm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The upcoming sim racer will have the expected modes, including a single-player career mode and an online multiplayer mode, which will feature leaderboards and "<em>full race weekends</em>" for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>While Project Motor Racing is being developed by Straight4 Studios, it's being built on publisher Giants Software's own GIANTS game engine. For chief executive officer of Giants Software, Christian Ammann, it's a new step forward for the studio and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is the next gear for GIANTS Software: Moving forward, we will be recognized not only as the creators of Farming Simulator but also as the publisher of Project Motor Racing,</span></em>" Ammann said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Our strong collaboration with Straight4 gives me full confidence that we’ll deliver an exceptional experience for all sim racing enthusiasts!</span></em>"</p>
<p>Straight4 Studios' chief executive officer, Ian Bell, added, "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is not about driving. It’s about racing. With our streamlined approach and what we consider to be the most authentic handling model we’ve ever created, Project Motor Racing is both a nod to our genre’s rich legacy and a big step into the next era of simulation.</span></em>"</p>
