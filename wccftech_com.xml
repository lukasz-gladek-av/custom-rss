			<p>Battlefield 6 is now only three weeks away from its October 10 launch date. Fans are counting down days following the successful beta, and the developers share more info through interviews. Yesterday, Technical Director Christian Buhl <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that having to optimize for a lower spec hardware like the Xbox Series S actually benefited the more powerful platforms, too.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Buhl and Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson have discussed the importance of delivering a great console experience in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Nickerson joked it was like the game was 'secretly console first'.  </p>



<p><em><strong>Christian Buhl:</strong> I could say we've been thinking about console and the console experience from the start of Battlefield 6. It has been a top-of-the-line thing. We have to build this game as if it was made primarily for console players. Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then ported to console, and it probably felt like that. That is not how this game was built. We built this from the beginning with the idea in mind that this is going to be on both console and PC. It has to feel and play like it is a console game that was built to be a console game.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Matthew Nickerson:</strong> We have a saying here in the office, in Ripple Effect when I joined the team, that I created, called 'Secretly Console First.’ It's a little moniker that kind of pokes fun. We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game, but we really have to care about console at the end of the day. We've been putting in the reps, putting in the work, just like Christian said. Console has been at the forefront of Battlefield 6 development since day one, and really, we're honed and we are well-crafted in providing this product at the highest quality possible.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, the two also shared that Battlefield 6 will offer console players the option to turn off cross-play with the PC version (which they may want to do in case of cheating issues) while maintaining cross-play between Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 consoles. When cross-play with PC is enabled, the matchmaking system will still look for console players first if you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation, only expanding the search to include PC if the lobby requires more players. Moreover, the developers have revamped aim assist compared to Battlefield 2042 to ensure cross-play is fair for all players.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing of the Battle Royale mode is ongoing on the Battlefield Labs platform</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo often makes fans wait a spell for DLC or expansions for their favorite games, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">most recent Nintendo Direct</a> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, released only two months ago, was getting DLC the same day as the presentation. The DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC adds a new stage based on DK’s tropical home featured in Rare and Retro Studios’ games, as well as a new fast-paced roguelite mode.</p>



<p>Is the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC a gem or are its flaws all too apparent? Swing on down for my full impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As the title of the DLC implies, the centerpiece of Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is a new HD recreation of the big ape’s island home from the Donkey Kong Country games. Nintendo has really gone all out rendering DK Island in all its glory, packing it with familiar characters, landmarks, and plenty of Easter eggs. It’s a welcome addition to a game that’s really a celebration of the Donkey Kong franchise as a whole, although it is hard to overlook the fact that Super Mario Odyssey included something similar – a stage based on the classic Mushroom Kingdom – as an in-game unlockable, while DK Island is stuck behind a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Super Mario Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom was also fully integrated into the core game, offering fresh challenges to tackle and Power Moons to collect. The same can’t be said of DK Island. While the tropical locale looks nice and will give you fuzzy nostalgic feelings, it strangely sits apart from the main game. There are no new Banandium Gems or fossils to collect here, making the whole experience feel a bit too much like a superficial theme park attraction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At least that’s true until you jump into Emerald Rush mode, which DK Island was clearly designed around. Emerald Rush is essentially an accelerated take on the roguelite genre, with all the gold in the game turned into glittering green gems. Over a series of quick 99-second rounds, you’re challenged to collect a specific quantity of green goodness by smashing ore deposits, defeating enemies, and finding green bananas (again, bananas can only be found on DK Island in Emerald Rush mode). The number of rounds you have to survive depends on the difficulty you’ve chosen, but thankfully, finding emerald fossils will grant you stackable upgrades that will help you as the rounds get tougher.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Emerald Rush is fun enough, in a simple, smashy-smashy sort of way, although it condenses the roguelite experience to such a degree that it all starts to feel a bit meaningless. You'll be picking up a <em>lot</em> of fossils, requiring you to choose upgrades almost constantly. While I'm absolutely sure some folks will get <em>really</em> into strategizing and finding synergies between upgrades, I found myself succumbing to information overload fairly quickly.</p>



<p>In addition to DK Island, you can unlock the ability to play Emerald Rush on the majority of DK Bananza’s layers, and it will likely take a solid half-dozen hours or more to unlock all the DLC’s new content. Even then, you can pump up the difficulty on each layer for a new challenge. That said, I'm not sure how long the average player is going to stick with the mode. Emerald Rush reminds me a lot of the Balloon World DLC for Mario Odyssey, in that it's something I think <em>some</em> players will really get into, but will be largely ignored by most.</p>

<h2 id="h-not-a-knockout-follow-up-punch"><strong>Not a Knockout Follow-up Punch</strong></h2>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush isn't without its charms, but the titular island's lack of integration into the main game, Emerald Rush mode's relatively simple gameplay loop, and a substantial $20 price tag means this DLC will likely only appeal to a relatively small subset of Bananza owners. If you've read through these impressions and are still interested, by all means, dig in, but given how substantial the core Donkey Kong Bananza experience is, others may prefer to keep mining for fun there.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is available now on Switch 2 for $20.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overseas-publishers-microsoft-want-games-done-quickly-as-possible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overseas-publishers-like-microsoft-want-games-done-as-quickly-as-possible-says-kamiya-who-still-can%E2%80%99t-let-scalebound-go.1298853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-1-0-to-launch-in-2026-pocketpair-will-focus-on-polishing-for-the-rest-of-2025.1298817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a video message that it aims to release Palworld 1.0 next year. To achieve that goal, they will focus on polishing, which means the rest of 2025 won't feature truly big updates to the early access version. Communications Director and Publishing Manager 'Bucky' explained:</p>



<p><em>We've reached a crossroads and need to decide what comes next. While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about 1.0. Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that it has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year in 2026. And we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game. So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won't be as big as Feybreak was. We hope our players understand that we're taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn't mean there will be no updates. We still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year. We just want to be transparent about where we're headed and the development of Palworld going forward. It is not slowing down or scaling back; quite the opposite. Version 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end.</em></p>



<p>Bucky also said that PocketPair is also doing other things, such as supporting other small developers through a publishing division and even starting to research other game ideas for future projects. Of course, Palworld is still what most of the company is concentrating on, and it couldn't be any different given the incredible success achieved when the game launched in early 2024, breaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record after record</a> for the first few weeks. To this day, PocketPair's survival action monster taming game is third on Steam's all-time concurrent player chart with 2.1 million players. Only Black Myth: Wukong and PUBG have done better. Overall, Palworld has surpassed 32 million players across all platforms earlier this year.</p>



<p>However, the Japanese developer also has to deal with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, which was filed nearly a year ago for alleged patent infringement. PocketPair is fighting the lawsuit in court, but in the meantime, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to introduce some changes to the game</a>.</p>
