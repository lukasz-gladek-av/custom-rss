			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 systems are <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/">starting to appear out in the wild</a>, and one person who was able to get their hands on the system early has taken the liberty of showcasing what the whole setup process looks like when you first turn on your Switch 2, minus all the parts that don't work because the system doesn't have the day one patch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-%E2%80%94-first-setup-menu-walkthrough.1200999/">Russian YouTube channel</a> took the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y49k7XwfE6k&amp;t=4s">publishing a video</a> that goes through the entire setup process for the Nintendo Switch 2, with the volume maxed, so viewers can hear the intro music and everything else that goes on when setting up your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The video was quickly taken down, which is not surprising as Nintendo is likely trying to keep a lid on these leaks with the console's launch only days away. But not before Wccftech, and many others could check out the video and see that much hasn't changed when it comes to the console's home screen.</p>
<p>Even in the system's settings, you won't see many changes regarding the layout and the options available. Some things are new, like the option to bump resolutions on the TV that you connect your Switch 2 device to up to 4K, but much has stayed the same, including the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 only comes with two basic themes for the console: White and Black.</p>
<p>There's always the potential that more will be added, but that's what we thought when the original Switch launched in 2017. Eight years later, we still have two basic themes available.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what else has changed and what else has stayed the same with the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5, 2025, and it can be used with the day one patch downloaded.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Copilot for Gaming in beta testing for mobile devices (iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass.beta&amp;hl=en-US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>). The early preview can be found in the beta version of the Xbox mobile app in select countries:&nbsp;Albania, Algeria Moldova, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In Microsoft's words, Copilot for Gaming aims to be the 'ultimate sidekick' for gamers. Users can access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen without distractions from the core gameplay experience. The AI knows which game they're playing and understands their Xbox activity, so it can answer questions about games players are interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the player's account, play history, and achievements.</p>
<p>Example prompts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Hey Copilot, can you remind me what materials I need to craft a sword in Minecraft?”</em></li>
<li><em>“(While playing South of Midnight): I’m stuck on Rougarou right now. Can you give me some tips on how to beat this boss?'”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m looking for a new RPG. Can you recommend something that has recently been released on Xbox?”</em></li>
<li><em>“‘Hey Copilot, what’s the rarest achievement you can get in Avowed?’”</em></li>
<li><em>“I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?”</em></li>
<li><em>“When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature will be improved over time, just as you'd expect in this case, with better personalization, proactive tips, and more. Testers can leave feedback under “More Options” in the app's top left corner, or simply by rating the answers with thumbs up or down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Almost two years ago, at the time of writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/">EA and Cliffhanger Games confirmed</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-open-world-game-rumor-ea-studio-shadow-of-morder-vets/">rumors</a> of a new Black Panther game coming from EA were true, and that the team at Cliffhanger was working on a new single-player, third-person action game with Black Panther as the main character.</p>
<p>Today, a new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN</a> revealed that EA has <strong>canceled</strong> its Black Panther game and shut down the studio working on it, Cliffhanger Games. It's the latest batch of layoffs from Electronic Arts after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off 300-400 developers last month</a> and canceled an incubation project at Respawn. It also recently announced that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">sunsetting its remote work policies</a> and moving to push employees back to working in the office.</p>
<p>According to the report, the layoffs extend to members of EA's mobile and central teams, but the company would not share exactly how many developers were impacted. In an email from Laura Miele, EA Entertainment president, she reportedly called the decision, and the other recent layoffs that EA has suffered, "<em>hard</em>" choices, but that they are choices being made to "<em>sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.</em>"</p>
<p>Miele also wrote that the company is doing "<em>everything we can to support them, including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles</em>." She also continues to say that moving forward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">EA's Entertainment division</a> will focus on: The Sims, Skate, Battlefield, and Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Respawn will still work on the upcoming third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-will-be-written-by-squirrel-girl-writer-ryan-north/">Iron Man game from Motive Studio</a> is still happening, though with this cancellation, it's worth not putting too much stock in Miele's reassurances about the Iron Man game, especially when considering what EA's chief executive officer, Andrew Wilson, said last year about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA moving away from games based on licensed IP</a>.</p>
<p>It's upsetting to see more developers lose their jobs, and an additional sad point with Cliffhanger Games's closure is that it's the latest part of the tragedy of Monolith Studios. Cliffhanger was founded by former Monolith developers who worked on the Shadow of Mordor games, and helped develop the nemesis system that players still rave about today. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith is gone</a>, and the studio founded by Monolith veterans is also gone.</p>
