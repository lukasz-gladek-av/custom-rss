			<p>NetEase is set to debut the fifth season of Marvel Rivals this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, and ahead of that launch, it released a new cinematic trailer showcasing the two new roster additions for Season 5, Gambit and Rogue. Also, as usual, NetEase released a Dev Vision video, which delved deeper into the changes coming in Season 5, including the introduction of a new Conquest mode.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Gambit will be the first new hero added to the roster starting on Friday, and he joins the roster as a Strategist, who can use his powers to heal allies, get rid of negative effects on allies, and also do damage against enemies while applying an anti-heal effect.</p>



<p>Season 5 also adds a new map set in New York's Times Square, but unlike other maps in Marvel Rivals, it is a non-combat map dedicated to letting players socialize and do whatever they like instead of always jumping into competitive modes.</p>



<p>Speaking of those competitive modes, the other introduction in this season is the new Conquest (Annihilation) mode. An 18v18 mode that unfortunately does not go live this Friday, but will be live during Season 5 on November 27, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is all just what NetEase has to show off for Season 5 so far, since under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/">new seasonal structure it instituted starting with Season 3</a>, each season is broken up into two halves, with one hero added to the roster in each half. So if you're looking for more from NetEase, there is more to come, you just have to wait a little longer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Game Awards, the final major video game industry event for the year, will take place at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025, and will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok, as per usual. This year, however, for the first time, the trailer-show masquerading as an awards show will be available to watch on Amazon Prime Video as well.</p>



<p>Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley announced the news <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1988291558417068465">with a post on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, where he writes, "<em>We’re excited to welcome</em> <em>Prime Video as another distribution partner for</em> <em>The Game Awards live on Thursday, December 11. For the first time, The Game Awards will stream live on Prime Video around the world in more than 200 countries and territories</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a significant move for the awards show and for Amazon as it is seemingly finding ways to keep ties to the video game industry through its TV show adaptations and now the live streaming of its most popular awards show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">but not through the actual development of video games</a>. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, not only will Amazon be livestreaming the show, it will launch a Game Awards-dedicated store for users to purchase Game Awards merchandise and take advantage of "<em>Prime-exclusive, limited-time deals across nominated games, new releases, hardware, and more, revealed in real time</em>."</p>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/">Variety</a>, Keighley said, "<em>The great news about this is that it's additive and we still get to air everywhere we already air the show, and we're adding Prime Video as a partner, which is really exciting for us. We've had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we're like, there's no way, there's no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch - where it was born back in 2014</em>."</p>



<p>Keighley also added that Amazon's involvement will not "<em>change</em>" the show. "<em>We're still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. This is still The Game Awards. It's the exact same show. They're really just another distribution outlet, and they're really letting us build the show the way</em> <em>we always do. We're not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders is, at the time of this writing, one of the most popular games in the video game industry. There are currently more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">300K people on Steam alone playing it right now</a>. Its developer, Embark Studios, just celebrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/">700K+ concurrent players over the weekend</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">over 4 million copies sold since it launched less than two weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>Embark is also a relatively small studio making huge waves in competitive genres, with its free-to-play first-person shooter, The Finals, and now with its third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders. In many ways, it's great to see a small to mid-size team have such an impact where historically only juggernauts can survive, and yet, a cloud of controversy hangs over the game, and conversation around that controversy has bubbled over in online spaces, thanks to debate surrounding a single review.</p>



<p>In its review, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer gave ARC Raiders 2/5 stars</a>, and specifically called out Embark Studios' use of generative AI voices for NPCs as a core criticism (it's worth noting that the same writer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">reviewed The Finals for Eurogamer</a>, and gave it 3/5 stars, while also critiquing the use of GenAI voices).</p>



<p>What has followed in the wake of this review is a large conversation across the video game industry about how we should talk about games that use generative AI, how we should review those games, and what should or should not go into a review. Game developers, players, YouTubers, and now, even Epic Games' chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, have joined the conversation to give their two cents.</p>



<p>Sweeney entered the conversation by first saying <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> responding to the review, "<em>Political opinions should go into op eds folks</em>." While it's worth pointing out that a review is inherently a person's opinion (which other users point out to Sweeney), the point that Sweeney expounds on is his argument that falling one way or the other on GenAI is 'political.'</p>



<p>Responding to a user asking him if it is political or not to dislike and critique GenAI within the context of a game review, Sweeney writes, "<em>Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines</em>."</p>



<p>He continues, "<em>Since the author states the pessimistic case, I'll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people</em>."</p>



<p>Sweeney further claims that he sees GenAI voices as "<em>an even bigger opportunity for in-game voice and voice actors</em>," and that he "<em>always found pre-written lines of fixed dialogue super limiting. It was painful to write text dialog in ZZT in 1991 after writing more dynamically-composed text adventure games in the 80s! AI dialog generation</em> <em>+ human personality tuning could totally transform gaming</em>."</p>



<p>It's difficult to understand how generative AI voices tuned by humans create "an even bigger opportunity" for actors, since those production pipeline models would inherently be designed to use fewer actors, resulting in fewer acting jobs available and ultimately less opportunity. Also, while any writer will tell you that writing can be a painful exercise at times, any writer worth their salt would rather work through those pains than let someone else, and even worse, something else, do it for them. Writing, like practically anything else in life, is a 'no pain, no gain' craft.</p>



<p>All that aside, Eurogamer's review has clearly hit a nerve and sparked further conversation about using generative AI in games, particularly in ways that directly replace jobs historically done by humans. Last month, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">Starfinder: Afterlight developers told Wccftech that "<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>."</a>  </p>

			<p>The YouTube channel People Make Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a video interview</a> with several workers who were suddenly fired by Rockstar Games earlier this month and have been protesting outside Rockstar North ever since. Right away, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it was a pure act of union-busting, as the workers had just secured a 10% agreement from the workforce at the Edinburgh office to unionize. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they had been leaking information on a public forum; however, the employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim</a> there was no evidence of that, and that they were rushed out with no due process or representation.</p>



<p>The author of the video notes that they had already been contacted about the new union, which was set to be announced shortly, and planned to create a video about it before the layoffs occurred. Throughout the interview, the employees express their dismay at the circumstances of their termination, which could also negatively impact their resumes due to the studio's claim of 'gross misconduct' as the cause. But they would also like to be reinstated into Rockstar and get back to work to finish Grand Theft Auto VI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for November 19, 2026</a>, following another delay). Bran said:</p>



<p><em>If I have gross misconduct on my CV, on my resume for the rest of my life, that is a huge detriment to any future career prospects. Something important to notice as well is you feel shame to be kicked out of work this way. Like, all of us still want to be here. We want our jobs, we want to finish what we were working on. And now the internal shame feel of having this gross misconduct with you forever, it's hard to explain.</em></p>

<p>What's happening next? Fred, an organizer from the IWGB, explains it:</p>



<p><em>The immediate goal here is very clear. It's the reinstatement of all 31 workers in the UK who've been fired and the three workers in Toronto. We know that our sister union in Canada is working to support. It's a reinstatement for those workers. It's full compensation for pay lost during this period. It's clear accountability for the way these dismissals have been handled, these very clear, unfair dismissals without procedure, without evidence. So clear accountability from the company, and a commitment to following employment law in the UK in the future.</em></p>



<p><em>What happens next is up to Rockstar. I just wanna be really clear. [...] We've just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they'll resolve this with us amicably, right? This is, in the end, egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organising in the last 20 years. This is the moment where Rockstar can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don't, they've seen what they have to contend with. The force of public feeling is against them on this, and we'll continue to put pressure on them through legal, through demonstrations, speaking about what these workers have experienced.</em></p>



<p>The layoff timing would seem odd if you consider that the studio wouldn't want to part with experienced workers while finishing a project of the magnitude of Grand Theft Auto VI. However, the UK is currently on the verge of passing the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67f6711f555773bbf109e21a/employment-rights-bill-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employment Rights Bill</a>, which will enhance security for workers starting next year, making this the best time to lay off people if someone really wanted to.</p>



<p>For his part, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">told IGN</a> that the work culture at the publisher and at Rockstar is 'extraordinary', though he did not make any further comment on the actual layoffs.</p>
