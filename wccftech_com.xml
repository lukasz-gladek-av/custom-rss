			<p>Publisher 505 Games and developer Supernova Games Studios, alongside a technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni, have announced a new branch of the Assetto Corsa series with Assetto Corsa Rally, a new rally racing game to expand on the sim racing already established in other Assetto Corsa games. It'll arrive on PC first with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Early Access release on Steam</a> set for this coming November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll be the second Assetto Corsa release this year, after Assetto Corsa EVO <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/">launched on January 16, 2025, also in early access</a>. It's also still in early access, with the last word on its 1.0 release being Fall 2025. That said, we're more than halfway through October at the time of this writing, and there's no official update.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer went alongside the announcement for Assetto Corsa Rally, which included short clips of in-game footage showcasing how Assetto Corsa is approaching rally racing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally has been built with an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine, which was tuned to better suit rally-style racing with uneven surfaces, jumps, more variable road conditions, a dynamic weather system, and more realistic vehicle behaviour across all the new variables and terrains found in rally racing.</p>



<p>In a press release, Supernova Games Studios specifically calls out the use of "<em>laser scan technology for every stage in each rally event, enabling accurate reproduction of real-world terrain formations, road surface irregularities and characteristics, and details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the physics engine built by KUNOS Simulazioni, Supernova Game Studios is developing Assetto Corsa Rally using Unreal Engine 5, to ensure "<em>high fidelity and performance</em>."</p>



<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches in early access next month, it'll include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>33km&nbsp;of fully laserscanned&nbsp;real-life roads.</em></li>



<li><em>4 Special Stages&nbsp;with&nbsp;18 variants, set across gravel roads in&nbsp;Wales&nbsp;and tarmac roads in&nbsp;Alsace</em>.</li>



<li><em>10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles</em>.</li>



<li><em>5 game modes, triple screen support, and more</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The full 1.0 version of the game will add six more special stages, a full 30 vehicle roster, new game modes including a career mode, a rally school mode, and VR support. For now, there's no inclination as to when v1.0 is expected to be ready.</p>



<p>"<em>Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we've built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts,</em>" Supernova Game Studios director, Maura Notarberardino, said. "<em>A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series, especially in terms of the driving model, in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can't wait to share the journey with you</em>."</p>



<p>KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder Marco Massarutto also added that a rally racing simulator in the Assetto Corsa series has been heavily requested by fans for years, and also shed some light as to why it took the series as long as it did to take this new step.</p>



<p>"<em>A proper rally simulation requires a dedicated approach that can leverage the unique aspects of this motorsports discipline,</em>" he began. "<em>Racing primarily against the chronometer, rather than against dozens of real-time processed AI opponents, frees up noticeable CPU resources, and this allows developers to push the boundaries of physics, as well as mechanical behaviour and tire models, across different surfaces that Assetto Corsa Rally will feature and simulate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The result is a dedicated and genuine rally simulation, powered by the Assetto Corsa physics engine, that can fully exploit its potential without compromise. Combining this advanced engine with some of the best real rally stages reproduced using laser-scan technology, the most iconic rally cars, adding up on the passion and competence of the Supernova dev-team, will allow to deliver an ultimate experience that fans have been anticipating for decades</em>."</p>



<p>Notarberardino is not entirely wrong to point out that there's a gap in the racing game genre when it comes to simulation-style rally racing games. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, and gained the rights to publish WRC games, it was expected that we'd get WRC games each year from 2023 to 2027, but that partnership ended after the release of EA Sports WRC 23. Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">confirmed earlier that it was pausing work on future WRC and rally games</a>, so fans of the more sim-focused WRC series and the less sim, more arcade-y DiRT were both let down.</p>



<p>A month after Codemasters' announcement, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/">Nacon was taking back control of making WRC-licensed games</a>, but because they're just starting up again, we still have some time before Nacon is ready to release a new WRC title.</p>



<p>Which means that when Assetto Corsa Rally hits PC in November, it'll be something new for rally fans, specifically simulation-focused rally racing fans, to dig their tires into. We'll see how it fares and how Assetto Corsa does with its first rally racing game.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/demons-souls-polishing-diamond/"> Demon's Souls PlayStation 5 remake</a> has been updated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">support the system's Power Saver Mode</a>, and the performance and resolution tweaks, and the reduced system power consumption may be the first glimpse at what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">rumored PlayStation handheld could deliver</a> running PS5 games.</p>



<p>The remake developed by Bluepoint Games, which launched with the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, has now been updated to support the new Power Saver Mode, as indicated by the little leaf icon on the system's main menu. Introducing this mode, which reduces the system's power consumption, is SIE's commitment to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html">"Road to Zero"</a> environmental plan launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-screenshots-and-performance">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Screenshots and Performance </h2>



<p>Although Power Saver mode has been <span>officially implemented on PS5 as part of a b</span>igger environmental effort,&nbsp;it has long been speculated&nbsp;that its implementation and limitations could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">a testing ground for the rumored PlayStation handheld</a>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">allegedly going to run PS5 games as well</a>.</p>



<p>The performance and resolution tweaks introduced in Demon's Souls remake definitely support this theory in part, at the very least. As can be seen from this set of screenshots I have captured from my launch PlayStation 5 at the start of the game, the resolution in Power Saver mode is lower than the resolution of both Performance and Cinematic display modes, even at a quick glance.</p>

<p>The frame rate target of the game's has also been changed for Power Saver mode, going from the 60 FPS of Performance Mode to 30 FPS. The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-el8fc5xg9h">?.?</a> accurately represents the experience, which is not the best for a home console for this type of game, but that wouldn't be terribly bad on a handheld gaming system.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-reduced-energy-usage">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Reduced Energy Usage</h2>



<p>Power Saver Mode delivers impressive reductions in energy usage as well. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-to-recieve-power-saving-mode-which-will-scale-back-performance-on-compatible-games-rumored-to-be-used-as-upcoming-portables-power-target.1250814/page-5#post-146505994">In a test conducted by ResetERA forums member vicegold</a>, power consumption went from hovering at ~224 W in the regular operating mode to ~98 W with power saver mode, which is quite a big difference. While this power consumption target is way too high for a handheld gaming system, the fact that the game wasn't horribly downgraded to achieve it with some software tweaks bodes quite well for the rumored handheld, which would require games to be tweaked similarly to run well on it.</p>



<p>The Demon's Souls remake is only one of the PlayStation 5 games that will be patched to support Power Saver mode. Among other titles to support the feature will be Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which will be another interesting game to test, given its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">solid 60 FPS performance and high-quality visuals.</a></p>
