			<p>Like the vast majority of modern games, Silent Hill f features a New Game Plus mod that has plenty of new content to offer over a regular first playthrough, which is not enough to fully experience the story, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">I highlighted in my review of the game</a>. Here's everything you need to know about this post-game play mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Forza Horizon 6</a> was undoubtedly the highlight of Xbox's Tokyo Game Show 2025 Broadcast. As fans had long speculated (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry insiders had recently suggested</a>), the next setting will be Japan. In an interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the Xbox Wire blog</a>, Playground Games Art Director Don Arceta teased that the open world of Forza Horizon 6 will blow away players with its beauty and variety.</p>



<p><em>While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer. From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built. And while we are not necessarily trying to recreate Japan and its environments like for like, our goal has always been to capture the country’s unique cultural essence and present it back in the most Horizon way possible.</em></p>



<p>The Seasons system that was introduced initially with Forza Horizon 4 will return in Forza Horizon 6, as confirmed by Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita:</p>



<p><em>The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound. The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.</em></p>



<p>More information about Forza Horizon 6 will be released in early 2026. The game will launch next year on PC and Xbox consoles first, with a PlayStation 5 version already confirmed to be coming at a later date.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem looks better than most expected on Nintendo Switch 2, judging from new footage captured during this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53319">a new TGS hands-on report from Famitsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the next entry in the series is available for testing in handheld mode alongside the PlayStation 5 version. While it is the same demo that CAPCOM brought to Gamescom, which, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">managed to be impressively haunting even in a far from optimal testing environment</a>, it being available on Nintendo Switch 2 has allowed the Famitsu reporter to quickly compare the two and highlight how playing the game on the Nintendo system in handheld mode doesn't dimish the experience in any significant way.</p>



<p>Besides Famitsu, others such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shacknews">Shacknews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@coelhonojapao">Coelho no Japão</a> tried Resident Evil Requiem on Nintendo Switch 2 during this year's Tokyo Game Show, sharing off-screen footage on YouTube. While a precise comparison with footage captured on other versions of the game is not possible at the moment, the Nintendo Switch 2 version already seems to be in an excellent spot, as some details, such as the hair rendering, seem to be better than what was shown in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Switch 2 version announcement trailer.</a> </p>



<p>In addition, the footage suggests the game is running at higher than 30 FPS in different scenarios, although drops are evident in some instances. As such, there's a good chance the game could be running at an unlocked framerate, which would not be the first time for <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-ps5-vs-xbox-series/">a game powered by the RE Engine that cannot run at a steady 60 FPS</a>. Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">Resident Evil Requiem supports ray tracing in some capacity on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, even just having the game run at 30 FPS with ray tracing on the system is still rather impressive.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">did not perform as well as the Finnish studio had hoped</a>. However, Remedy has not given up. The studio has a plan to improve the game in key areas, starting with the first major free update, Breakpoint, scheduled to go live on Monday, September 29.</p>



<p>Breakpoint adds a new playable Crisis mission, Outbreak, set in the Research Sector, where a Mold infestation creates unique challenges and enemies, as well as a dangerous new condition. The developer also overhauled the old Job Board with a Crisis Board, offering curated crises to play that are refreshed every half hour. Four to six Crises will be active at any given time, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs.</p>



<p>Each Crisis has randomized rewards, objectives, and length. Crises in the first two zones have been tweaked with streamlined requirements and can occasionally feature unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. Additionally, the Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to assist other groups.</p>



<p>Following this update, every weapon and piece of equipment in FBC: Firebreak is fully powered the moment you unlock it. New gear is unlocked simply by playing and leveling up, while a smaller set of streamlined currencies now focuses on unlocking cosmetics and Perk upgrades. On the other hand, Remedy introduced a new progression layer with gun mods, of which there will be 27. </p>



<p>Breakpoint also introduces three brand new heavy weapons (Semi-automatic rifle, Scattergun, and Rotary cannon) and three new grenades (Freeze, Healing, and Black Rock). Remedy even increased the enemy variety with five new types: two Mold foes (Mold Walker and Mold Turret) and three new Hiss threats with variants: the Corrupted Ranger, the Corrupted Ranger (Airborne), and the Demolition Expert. The new Hiss threats can be encountered throughout the whole game, while the Mold foes are exclusive to the new Outbreak Crisis.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also going to be a new tutorial level, orientation videos, and a redesigned early-game flow to make it more accessible to newcomers. Lastly, there's a series of quality-of-life improvements, such as already unlocked Altered Augments and Improvised Devices from level 1. Augments and Devices have been tuned to be usable more often than before and will also have a more substantial impact while playing. Additionally, moving while downed and sliding have been added.</p>



<p>Breakpoint is just the beginning. The next major update, which will include a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, will be released in late November. A third patch will go live in March 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-admits-mistake-with-new-payday-2-subscription-and-price-increase-of-infamous-collection-dlc-bundle.1309500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced an optional Payday 2 subscription</a> that automatically includes access to all the many (over 65) DLCs available for the cooperative heist-based first-person shooter game. Subscription options include a monthly and auto-renewing $4.99 fee or a biannual $19.99 fee (discounted by 31% compared to the monthly one).</p>



<p>If players subscribe and subsequently cancel at a later date, they get to retain any progress made (level, money, and inventory). However, any DLC content in their inventory, such as weapons, characters, heists, or masks, will become unavailable. Access can be regained by renewing your subscription or by purchasing the relevant DLC.</p>



<p>However, alongside the introduction of this new subscription model, Starbreeze also reduced the discount on the popular Infamous Collection bundle, which includes all the Payday 2 DLCs released so far, from 52% to 33%. This led to a community outrage that brought recent user reviews on Steam down to 54% (overall reviews are at a healthy 87%), as fans likened it to a scummy move to get people on board with the new subscription option. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PAYDAY 2: Subscription Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1BeTuIJOi8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to the website Game Developer</a>, Gustav Nisser (Head of Commercial at Starbreeze) admitted the mistake, adding that the Payday 2 Infamous Collection bundle has had its discount restored to 52%.</p>



<p><em>We dropped the ball on coordinating internally and communicating with our community properly. The negative reaction makes complete sense, and the community has made it clear how the price change and its timing looks from the outside. We agree with the community, we messed up on this one, and we have reverted the price on the bundle effective immediately. In hindsight, we should have realized how it would seem. Since the bundle only charges for the items you don't own, and the bundle discount is cumulative with any other discounts (i.e., discounts on the included items), the actual full price of the bundle can vary significantly.</em></p>



<p>Given <span>Payday 3's commercial failure (<a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank">certified by Embracer</a>, the parent company of game publisher Deep Silver), Starbreeze should exercise</span> a little more care when it comes to its most prized game IP. </p>



<p>The Swedish studio's next project is, however, based on a popular licensed franchise: Dungeons and Dragons. The so-called Project Baxter, an online co-op game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is supposed to launch in 2026</a>.</p>
