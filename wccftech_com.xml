			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1562831&amp;action=edit" aria-label="“Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Marvel Rivals, Path of Exile 2 NVIDIA Game Ready Driver Now Available For Download” (Edit)">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is an impressive ray tracing showcase on Xbox Series X and even Xbox Series S, according to a new in-depth analysis shared online today.</p>
<p>In their tech review of the action-adventure title developed by MachineGames, which is now available in early access for those who purchase one of the game's special editions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the game is an impressive ray tracing showcase on both Microsoft's current-generation consoles, thanks to its main visual feature, ray-traced diffuse global illumination. This is used to calculate indirect lighting from light sources like the sun, making the lighting in pretty much every scene feel incredibly natural. In a couple of scenes shown in the video below, RTGI makes scenes with light pouring from outside look incredible, with no light bleed or gaps in the lighting. Even more impressive is how clean it looks, although there are some light image quality stability issues when moving the camera around quickly, and the fact that, on Xbox Series X, the game averages 1800p resolution and successfully targets 60 FPS gameplay. Building the lighting system of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using ray tracing was also an excellent choice for the game's setting, as Indy explores a lot of locations that have natural lighting, enhancing the experience considerably while making the whole game a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>MachineGames also managed to get the game running decently on Xbox Series S with RTGI. Unsurprisingly, some compromises had to be made, such as lowering the resolution to 1080p and below, but generally, experiencing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the system is perfectly viable, even with some image quality issues caused by a disappointing implementation of Variable Rate Shading, lower texture quality and more.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an impressive game not only for its gorgeous visuals but also for its gameplay and story, which is one of the best Indiana Jones stories ever made.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas launched as PlayStation 2 exclusives back in the day, and the deal to bring these games exclusively to the console was signed partially because Sony was worried about Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking during an EGX London special session hosted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/christopher-dring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring</a>, Chris Deering, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president up until the release of the PlayStation 3, commented on the many deals that made several third-party games PlayStation exclusives, saying that some of them, such as the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, were signed partially as a reaction to Xbox. The company was worried when they saw the console coming, and they knew exclusivity was a big deal in other fields, so, as the first Xbox launch was approaching, they spoke with some of their favorite third-party developers and publishers, asking them if they would have liked to sign a special deal to keep their next-generation games PlayStation exclusives for two years. Take-Two was among the publishers that accepted the offer, which paid off in a very big way against expectations, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grand Theft Auto</a> wasn't as big as it is nowadays, with its first top-down entries not having exactly set the world on fire.</p>
<p>Besides commenting on the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, other former Sony executives commented on other interesting facts about PlayStation's 30-year history, such as trade media skepticism of the PlayStation 2, the well-known PlayStation 3 development issues, London Studio complaining about the lack of a built-in camera for the PlayStation 4, and more. You can find more about these facts and other anecdotes <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 announcements, the last remaining showcase before the end of the year is The Game Awards. It's also the biggest show, usually, although there have been slow years when host Geoff Keighley himself has tempered fans' expectations in advance to avoid disappointments.</p>
<p>This is not one of those times, at least according to VideoGameChronicle Founder Andy Robinson, who undoubtedly inherited a lot of contacts from his former career as an industry professional. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1864973090263900372?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Robinson teased a very big show, adding that it's not a guess.</p>
<p><em>Expecting a VERY big The Game Awards next week. Fire up the hype train. </em><em>Definitely not a guess.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps that shouldn't be surprising. 2024 may not have had as many big releases as 2023, but 2025 is looking better thanks to games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Avowed, Monster Hunter Wilds, Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Doom: The Dark Ages, Fable, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto VI, Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, South of Midnight, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There's a solid chance to see at least some of these 2025 games at The Game Awards 2024, but Robinson seems to refer mostly to game reveals for titles we haven't really seen anything yet. This category could include the likes of Ark 2, the upcoming BioShock title, Rare's Everwild, Archetype's Exodus, Marvel's Wolverine, Monolith's Wonder Woman, the next Metro from 4A Games, and even projects we haven't heard before. Let us know in the comments which of these games (or other titles we haven't mentioned) you'd like to see unveiled.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of candidates</a> for the coveted Game of the Year award:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
</ul>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 goes live on December 12 at 4:30pm PT / 7:30p ET / 12:30a+1 GMT from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's Path of Exile 2 Early Access launch is setting out to be a smashing success, considering the huge number of EA redemptions reported by developer Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>A few hours ago on X, the Path of Exile 2 developer confirmed they reached 1 million Early Access redemptions, thanking players for the unexpected level of support. With so many players, however, unforeseen issues may arise during the launch window, and queues during the weekend should be expected, according to the developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just reached 1 million Early Access redemptions. The support you have all shown for Path of Exile 2 Early Access is far beyond anything we could have ever predicted. However we want to be upfront with you all and let you know there may very well be queues over the weekend. <a href="https://t.co/bwGpsVNdGU">pic.twitter.com/bwGpsVNdGU</a></p>
<p>— Path of Exile (@pathofexile) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The smashing success of the Path of Exile 2 Early Access release is completely deserved. The very first version of the second entry in the series will launch with<a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/"> a lot of content</a>, which includes six playable classes with two Ascendancy classes each, three story acts, and a fully featured endgame that introduces new mechanics that will push the gameplay mechanics to their absolute limits. Everything that Grinding Gear Games revealed so far only reinforced the positive opinion I had of the game after having tried the game during Gamescom earlier this year.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Early Access launches later today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the full game will be free-to-play like its predecessor, the Early Access version is only available after purchasing any of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporter packs.</a></p>

			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has already sold two million copies between retail and digital. Given that the game launched less than a month ago, it's a great result for the Japanese publisher.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated the remake 8.6 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D, while not the definitive edition that includes all of the previous side content, embodies the perfect version of Erdrick's adventure that both old and new fans can appreciate as if a brand new adventure from Yuji Horii.</em></p>

			<p>Among the many new game announcements featured in yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, Deepest Fear certainly stands out as one of the most intriguing.&nbsp;It is being developed by Variable State, a British independent studio known for games like Virginia, Last Stop, and the upcoming Polaris.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Deepest Fear is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter game featuring inspirations from the likes of James Cameron, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoven in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, System Shock 2, and Dead Space were cited as inspirations for the gameplay, which is said to mix Metroidvania design with immersive simulation elements, allowing the player to come up with interesting solutions to the various situations presented throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's also a particular twist in that Deepest Fear features a full-fledged real-time fluid simulation, which protagonist Dr. Danni Carrol will use to fight otherworldly entities that manifest spontaneously from any water source. Moreover, the surrounding environment can flood and take in water at any moment, sweeping her away with unpredictable currents and plunging the protagonist into the suffocating depths.</p>

<p>The game has no release date yet, but there's already a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334930/DEEPEST_FEAR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> that even includes the system requirements.</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced Founder Access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, which gives those who purchased it the opportunity to have a say on features within the space survival simulation game while also being given access to the in-development build of the game on a continuous basis. This access begins on December 10, when those who hold the Founder Access pass will be able to join the exclusive, always-on server in Closed Alpha. This gives them the opportunity to provide crucial feedback to the developers and leave their mark on the game before it is released.</p>
<p>Releasing Founder Access marks the start of the next phase of development of EVE Frontier by allowing those who have purchased the pass to access it permanent pre-launch access. By doing this, it means that players will be able to play and experience EVE Frontier before it has launched and will be able to give feedback to the developers on features that may need tweaking or adding or even bug fixes that CCP Games may have missed. Of course, that is not the only thing that players can get by purchasing Founder Access. Players will also get additional benefits, such as name reservations, cosmetics, Discord roles, and special access to CCP Games Developer streams. Additionally, when the game launches in the future as free-to-play, Founders will be able to redeem their included premium subscription time.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official 'First Look'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sOVGHEyCnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said:</p>
<p><em>In EVE Frontier we are deepening the contribution and connection players have over a living galaxy. A virtual world where developers and players are equals, where the rules apply to all. Our long-term vision is to create an open ecosystem built, operated, and governed by the Frontier's inhabitants themselves.</em></p>
<p>From today, those interested will be able to purchase Founder Access to EVE Frontier, with three different tiers to purchase. The cheapest tier is $29.99 and includes a Unique Awakened Portrait and one month of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time. The second tier, named Initiated, is $59.99, including two exclusive skins, a portrait, two months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, and a 24-hour early start at launch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third tier, which is the most expensive and provides the most benefits. This comes with a unique Ascended Portrait and three exclusive skins. You'll also get four months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, a Name Reservation, and a 72-hour early start at launch. To get all of these benefits, you'll have to pay $89.99.</p>
