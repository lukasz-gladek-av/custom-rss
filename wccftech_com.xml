			<p>At some point during development, Hideo Kojima made some changes to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach because the game was doing too well during playtests and wasn't polarizing enough, according to the game's co-composer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, French composer Woodkid talked about working with Hideo Kojima on the game and how challenging it was to write music that changes in real time while playing, and how difficult it was to put together the eclectic mix of musical genres the game's soundtrack features. When asked, at the end of the interview, about something essential the composer learned working on the game, Woodkid mentioned how, one day, Hideo Kojima confirmed his intention of making changes to the game because it was being too well-received in play tests. These changes, which reportedly include some script changes and the way some important events play out, were meant to make the game more polarizing, trigger more emotions and ensure people would love the game after initially disliking it, as this is how something gets loved for real, Kojima-san reportedly said.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Hideo Kojima not being too happy with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach's positive reception during play tests. <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Last month</a>, the legendary game creator commented on the matter with Edge Magazine, saying that he wished the game would be more controversial, as he isn't interested in developing games with mass market appeal. To see if the game will indeed be less controversial than its predecessor, we won't have to wait long, as it will launch on PlayStation 5 next week, on June 26th.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility seems to be even better than anticipated before the system's launch, as several original Switch games run much better on the new console.</p>
<p>A new test shared a few days ago by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a> highlights how plenty of original Switch games run considerably better on its successor, such as Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom, The Wonderful 101 Remastered, Darksiders 3, Resident Evil 5, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and a few others.&nbsp;In the vast majority of cases, the games analyzed in the video had trouble keeping consistent framerates and hitting the 60 FPS mark, but on Nintendo Switch 2, they do so effortlessly, further highlighting how good backward compatibility is even for unpatched games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Back Compat - More 60fps Games Tested!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG3G-gFuwQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the system doesn't innovate the same way many other Nintendo systems did over their predecessors, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a solid console and a massive improvement over the original in pretty much every way, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4k when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-on-xbox-series-x-hits-as-low-at-720p-resolution-but-delivers-better-performance-than-playstation-5-version.1220295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI comes with some significant issues, but, at the very least, it offers more solid performance in Frame Rate Mode than the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the recently released port, highlighting how, in both Graphics and Frame Rate modes, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X renders at a much lower resolution than on PlayStation 5. In a scene set in Rosalith at the beginning of the game, the game renders at 1440p on PlayStation 5 and at 1224p on Xbox Series X, which is unusual as most games either run at the same resolution on both systems or at a slightly higher resolution on Xbox Series X. As such, the image tends to look blurrier on the system than on PlayStation 5, despite both versions using TSC MAA and AMD FSR 1. The lower resolution of the Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI, however, isn't the biggest issue of the port, as Digital Foundry highlighted how there are a lot of visual differences related to gamma presentation, brightness, and contrast. Other things look downright broken, like foliage rendering, so the port definitely needs patches to address these issues.</p>
<p>In Frame Rate Mode, however, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X fares a little better. While the resolution is dropped to 720p over the 1080p of the PlayStation 5 release, the game runs at a locked 60 FPS during traversal and combat, which the PS5 version doesn't achieve. Sadly, the lower resolution isn't the only element that had to be scaled down to achieve better performance, as the level of detail is also lower.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy 16 Tested on Xbox Series X|S - And There Are Issues" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjmzmgeqFYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Final Fantasy XVI is among the heaviest console games of the generation, it's not surprising to see how even the Xbox Series X cannot handle it properly without some significant cutbacks. While it is a shame the game launched in a far from optimal state on the system, it's still a good thing it finally did, as Clive Rosfield's adventure is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert to Launch on November 2, Says Korean Website]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Crimson Desert would be released in Fall 2025 for PC and consoles. However, we still haven't heard any specific date.</p>
<p>That changed this morning when Korean website MTN <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061710543196451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an exclusive report revealing that Pearl Abyss is leaning toward a November 2 global launch. The game is said to be in the final stages of development, and provided that there are no unforeseen issues, this date should be confirmed in an official capacity soon. Needless to say, we've reached out to Pearl Abyss to check if they'd like to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside DokeV and PLAN 8. Back then, it was supposed to be not too dissimilar from the studio's flagship product, the MMORPG Black Desert. Over time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> it to a single player action/adventure game with a heavy focus on narrative, which inevitably caused a significant delay (the game was initially slated to debut in Winter 2021).</p>
<p>In the game, players will become Kliff, captain of the Greymanes, a band of mercenaries. Alongside his comrades, Kliff embarks on a perilous journey to defend the continent of Pywel from the snow-capped mountains of Kweiden to the lush plains of Akapen and the lofty ridges dotting the titular Crimson Desert.</p>
<p>Throughout the adventure, players will encounter dependable allies and countless foes who will stop at nothing to see you fail. They'll have to overcome many challenges to unravel the mystery surrounding an impending catastrophe and restore peace to the continent.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert features a massive open world that takes full advantage of the BlackSpace Engine. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at GDC 2025, the technology allows for accurate simulations of trees, grass, clothing, and hair, real-time physics and destructibility, volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, dynamic weather, ray tracing, ocean and shallow water simulations, and more.</p>
