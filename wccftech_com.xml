			<p>Crimson Desert developer and publisher Pearl Abyss has debuted a new 13-minute gameplay video showcasing a snippet of what Gamescom 2025 attendees will get a chance to play in the coming week.</p>



<p>The action-adventure game was delayed just days prior to this new gameplay drop, pushing the game into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">first quarter of Pearl Abyss' FY2026</a>. It's the game's second major delay, as it was initially meant to arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">sometime earlier this year</a> after a demo showcase at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and then when that didn't happen, it was supposed to release sometime in fall 2025.</p>



<p>Now, of course, we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on it unless you'll be at Gamescom 2025, where you'll get to play the sections featured in this video and a bit more.</p>



<p>This gameplay showcase features a look at a few moments of narrative and exploration, but the highlight of the video is the extended look at combat, including a boss fight towards the back-half of the video.</p>



<p>At this point in the game's story, Crimson Desert's protagonist, Greymane Kliff, and his companions are ambushed, narrowly surviving the attack before Kliff has to take on the boss you'll see in the video, Cassius Morten.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert was first revealed all the way back in 2019, and with its release now set for sometime next year, it'll potentially be seven years from its reveal to its release. </p>



<p>At least it appears to be worth the wait, if the final gameplay experience is as polished as these gameplay videos make it seem. Hopefully, we'll have a proper release date to look forward to soon.</p>
