			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not arrived on consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-drops-on-consoles-on-july-15/">15 days ago</a> from the time of this writing. In its first four days on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S shelves, it sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-past-1-million-copies-sold-consoles-10-million-total-copies-sold/">1 million copies</a>, bringing the game's total sales to 10 million between consoles and PC. In the remaining 11 days, it sold another million copies, marking another huge milestone for the tactical shooter by hitting 2 million copies in just two weeks, and 11 million copies sold since its initial PC launch.</p>



<p>"<em>First, thank you to the players - for showing up, playing hard, and bringing order to chaos</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julio-rodriguez-2591bb10_readyornot-consolelaunch-2million-activity-7356271625538846720-imwP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Next, to the VOID dev team for building what we believe is the quintessential tactical FPS of our era — and to our friends and partners for helping us bring RON to console.</em>"</p>

<p>Ready or Not's console launch is clearly going well, but its success on PS5 and Xbox Series devices hasn't diminished how upset its PC player base has been since the console update, which brought a number of changes that didn't sit well with PC players.</p>



<p>Players have called out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">changes </a>to certain aspects of the game censorship, and while it's clear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">review bombing on Steam</a> that a good chunk of the player base agrees, another element to this that players on PC are upset with is what players are calling a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1md3lai/i_have_some_questions_regarding_the_recent/">"<em>downgrade</em>"</a> in the graphics to align with the console versions.</p>



<p>We'll see how VOID Interactive responds in the coming weeks, and if there are any meaningful retractions from the studio to appease the players it has upset.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-unveils-paragon-antiquary-and-ritualist-elite-specs.1257069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet unveiled the second trio of elite specializations that will be introduced in the upcoming expansion Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity. Following the Troubadour, the Galeshot, and the Luminary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-three-elite-specializations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last week</a>, this time it's all about the Paragon, Antiquary, and Ritualist.</p>



<p>The Ritualist is an elite specialization for the Necromancer. It's inspired by the original Guild Wars Ritualist profession, and it summons weapon spells that affect nearby allies. It also summons the spirits of Anguish, Wanderlust, and Preservation to attack foes.</p>



<p>The Antiquary is the new elite specialization for the Thief. As purveyors of rare artifacts, Antiquaries use their Pilfer skill to call upon the thieving inclination of their Skritt companions. They steal from enemies to create random improvised weapons. The Antiquary can use its unique skills while on cooldown, but doing so may cause detrimental effects, making it a risky proposition.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, there's the Paragon, a new elite specialization for the Warrior. With spear and shield in hand, these protectors of Elona build up their motivation resource by using burst skills. They can channel this motivation into vocal shouts, such as chants, refrains, commands, and echoes. These affect the surrounding area, either punishing enemies or supporting allies of the Paragon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Presumably, ArenaNet will share the final three elite specializations for the remaining classes (Revenant, Engineer, and Elementalist) at some point next week. As a reminder, Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released on October 28</a>; beyond the new elite specializations, it'll offer brand new zones, new raid encounters, a new Fractal, a new Convergence, a new Homestead map, three new Mastery tracks for the Skimmer aquatic mount and various new armor, weapons, legendaries, and relics. The story itself centers around the Inquest's nefarious plan for the island of Castora.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, July 31, 2025. It'll be a 25-minute-long presentation of games from Nintendo's publishing partners, so it's unlikely that we'll get announcements like the release date for Metroid Prime 4. But it could be the kind of place where we see the release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, but it's the kind of news to expect instead of any news about Nintendo's first-party titles, as those are the kinds of announcements Nintendo would likely hold for a dedicated 'Nintendo Direct.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">rumors circulating </a>about a Nintendo Direct happening before the end of July, as a follow-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, to let players know what's coming next for the console. Those rumors were seemingly correct, though not about it being a full-fat Nintendo Direct that would include first-party announcements.</p>



<p>Which could, of course, mean indie titles like Silksong and Hades II show up. Though it could also, and potentially even more likely, mean that we see more ports of games that are already available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series devices that the Nintendo Switch wasn't capable of running, but the Switch 2 can run perfectly well. </p>



<p>Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Hi-Fi Rush, Assassin's Creed Mirage, or news of a release date for some of the major ports already announced, like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever's there, thankfully we won't have long to wait to find out, as the direct will kick off tomorrow morning at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/">Devil May Cry 5</a> was CAPCOM's best-selling game for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, boosted by the Netflix anime show's launch in April.</p>



<p>In its report for Q1 FY2026, the Japanese publisher confirmed that the fifth entry in the series sold 1,782,000 units in April-June 2025, the only game by the publisher to achieve more than 1 million sales in the quarter. Street Fighter 6 is also reported to have been doing well, and thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 release, the latest entry in the legendary fighting game series has now surpassed five million units.</p>



<p>Looking at the report's Unit Sales ranking, it's impossible not to notice how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> hasn't performed all that well. The game only sold 477,000 units in the first quarter of the fiscal year, a sheer drop from the high sales reported in its launch window and barely surpassing Monster Hunter Rise. Hopefully, the development team will be able to turn things around and address the issues that have been putting off many players.</p>



<p>Besides confirming Devil May Cry 5's solid performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, CAPCOM has also reported significant growth, with net sales increasing by 53.7% year-on-year to ¥45,502 million, operating profit increasing by 90.8% to ¥24,597 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent increasing by 72.8% to ¥17,238 million. Impressive results, considering the publisher hasn't released any major titles in the quarter.</p>



<p>As a longtime fan of the series, I am happy to learn that Devil May Cry 5 is doing great on the market so many years after its release., showing CAPCOM how there's still a strong interest in Dante, Vergil and Nero's story. Hopefully, it won't take long to see another entry in the series, although longtime series director Hideaki Itsuno leaving CAPCOM<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/"> last year </a>likely impacted whatever the publisher is planning for the series.</p>
