			<p>Remedy Entertainment Creative Director Sam Lake was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDKF2dlK6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by IGN</a> about the prospects of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-game-in-the-remedy-connected-universe-is-already-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which he feels is really just getting started after Control and Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><em>Personally, to me, games are a storytelling medium and, from that perspective, an art form.... It's been a long journey. I can look back and see logical steps through it all, but more and more, I'm looking at it from the perspective of all of these different forms of expression, mediums, and art forms, how games as a very modern medium can hold all of that in them and how in this interactive form we can use everything that has come before and give it kind of a new meaning and context. </em></p>
<p><em>We can really use all of that to create these layered worlds that the player can then go and experience and explore. I feel that we made a very decisive leap forward when it comes to that, but in no way do I feel that we would have kind of reached the end. Already in the process of creating this latest game, there were a lot of new exciting ideas that came about but were not possible to explore in the context of Alan Wake 2.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like we are just getting started, so I feel it's too early to start talking about an endgame. I love tying these things together. I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand and entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting.</em></p>
<p>Sam Lake also explained that how these games will be connected might also incite newcomers to try the other games in the universe made by Remedy.</p>
<p><em>The way we are looking at it, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own on feet, but then for our fans for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story. Also, we feel hopeful that now that there is a universe and a catalog of games that will be expanding as we go, somebody playing their first Remedy game can then continue in the universe and check out the other games as well and dive deeper into that rabbit hole.</em></p>
<p>Lake talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna</a>, too, calling them the perfect partner to work on a film or TV series adaptation. The closest new Remedy project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, though, a cooperative multiplayer that likely won't put too much emphasis on storytelling for a change.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Canadian developer Yellow Brick Games <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874832372568666282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that a free demo for its debut title, Eternal Strands, will be released on January 21, one week before the full game's launch. The demo's content has not been revealed yet, nor do we know if progress will carry over to the full game once purchased.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands is the new game by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Dragon Age lead Mike Laidlaw</a>. After leaving BioWare, Laidlaw worked on an unannounced Arthurian-inspired roleplaying game at Ubisoft, but that project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ex-chief-creative-officer-canceled-an-arthurian-rpg-from-dragon-age-designer-mike-laidlaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a>. Afterward, Laidlaw founded Yellow Brick Games to make this intriguing fantasy third-person action/adventure title.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, Francesco and I were able to play a short but impressive demo that showcased the game's emphasis on physics. Here's an excerpt from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>What truly makes Eternal Strands stand out is the well-realized magic system. Every spell, from the simplest elemental shots to the more complex gravity-based ones, interacts not only with the environment and the enemies but also with one another. One gravity spell, for example, can propel Brynn forward and up in the air, but it can also be used to push enemies into chasms or to extend the range of elemental shots. In other cases, another spell can make other spells whose effects go off after a short while activate instantly.</em></p>
<p>The story follows Brynn, a young magical weaver and treasure hunter, as she seeks&nbsp;to unravel the secrets of the Enclave with the help of her companions. Long ago, the Enclave was a center of magical development, trade, innovation, and social life. But after arcane disasters spread across the Mayda region, it sealed itself off behind a magical wall known as the Veil. Now, it falls upon Brynn and her fellow weavers to unlock their secrets.</p>
<p>While there will be dialogue choices, despite Laidlaw's background, do not expect big moral choices leading to different endings. However, from what we've played, the action should be very fun. Eternal Strands is also expected to last a decent amount, between 25 and 35 hours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the studio</a>. More content is coming after the January 28 launch, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-launches-january-28-2025-post-launch-collab-with-square-enix-creative-studio-iii-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III Lead Artist Yusuke Mogi (known for FINAL FANTASY XIV Online) to design a new Epic creature, weapons, and armor set. The system requirements for Eternal Strands are listed below; the game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will get it on day one.</p>
