			<p>We know that RGG Studio is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> and a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter</a> title, and it's a fair assumption that there's a new Like a Dragon game on the horizon. As far as what else the studio might be working on, we have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/">RGG Summit </a>to look forward to next week, but it seems like someone at SEGA or RGG Studio jumped the gun, accidentally revealing the next Yakuza game, as the RGG website showed a brief mention of Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>



<p>The mention was spotted on the <a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">studio's official site</a> and posted to <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605">X (formerly Twitter)</a> before being shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/">Reddit</a>, and though it was quickly taken down, it remained cached in Google, and could be seen by searching "龍が如く 極 3" site:http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com."</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are both remakes of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, so it follows that Yakuza Kiwami 3 would be a remake of Yakuza 3. If this slip-up is indeed real, then on top of expecting more looks at Stranger Than Heaven, Virtua Fighter, and the next Like a Dragon game, we can add an official Kiwami 3 reveal to the list for next week's RGG Summit and Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Last year, RGG Studio's series director for Yakuza, Masayoshi Yokoyama, hinted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-entry-auditions-kiwami-3-not-next-someday/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 might happen "<em>someday</em>."</a> It seems like 'someday' is coming sooner than we might've thought.</p>

			<p>Wreckreation is the latest game from Three Fields Entertainment, a studio that was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the beloved Burnout series. Published by THQ Nordic, after Wreckreation was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">2022</a>, three years later we have a release date to look forward to, with the open-world driving sandbox arriving on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced alongside a new trailer that showcases the bright vistas and the insane tracks that are possible for players to create in this sandbox title, as Wreckreation is as much about building your own dream tracks as it is racing them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What makes building your own tracks as core to Wreckreation as the actual driving is the fact that you're not swapping from one mode to another if you want to make a change or adjustment to the road in front of you.</p>



<p>Changes to the track, your environment, like the weather or time of day, adding loops, and even adding a slew of decorations can all be done on the fly at the press of a button. With more than 50 cars, and 400 square kilometers of sandbox to run around in, there are plenty of ways you can create your own racing paradise.</p>



<p>Wreckreation will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 28, 2025, for $39.99/€39.99.</p>
