			<p>British developer Jagex announced a round of layoffs. Community Manager JagexHooli <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1l1fut4/comment/mvkxroe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it earlier this week with the following Reddit comment:</p>
<p><em>Yes, there have unfortunately been job reductions at Jagex. These have been made as part of changes in a company restructure as Jagex puts more emphasis on RuneScape games and community growth. The majority of roles are from non-game dev and non-player facing areas. There are some exceptions within the RS team as part the company's focus on a streamlined development approach.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure many of you are concerned about what this means for RuneScape 3. This is not a change in direction from what Mod North has said before – we are still committed to growing this game and investing in it. Our Roadmap won’t change because of these job reductions, and we’ll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content. We will talk to you about this when the time is right.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters most right now are the people affected by this change. The studio’s focus is to support those affected, as is mine. Now is the time we put them first and do everything we can to help them out.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, work on 'Project Zanaris', whose objective was to allow private servers for Old School RuneScape, has been paused. On this note, Jagex <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/pausing-project-zanaris--whats-next?oldschool=1#_ga=2.197087977.499468828.1749024097-1248850839.1749024095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely. We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.</em></p>
<p>Jagex recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a survival cooperative multiplayer game, on Steam Early Access. According to Steam data, it was purchased by 550K, 789K, or 842K users, depending on the analytics website (VG Insights, Gamalytic, PlayTracker).</p>

			<p>You'll do a lot of collecting in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, including collecting the creatures you discover while roaming the four main planets you visit across the game's story. In some cases, capturing and researching these creatures is essential to your progression in the game.</p>
<p>So, how do you capture creatures? Some of the exact details for each creature change the process slightly, but the rules are mostly the same. This guide will show you how to capture creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, so you'll be prepared for anything that has the misfortune of being in your way.</p>
<h2>Revenge Of The Savage Planet - How To Capture Creatures</h2>
<p>Before we get into the how of capturing creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, you'll need to make sure you've already collected your whip. Without it, you can't capture anything. You'll also want to make sure that you're not surrounded by plenty of other creatures that will be hostile towards you.</p>
<p>Any interruption means you restart the process, so it's good to single out one creature to capture at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you have a creature you want to capture in your sights, the very first thing you'll want to do is scan it. Jump into scanning mode, and give it a scan, even if you've already scanned that species. The info box that will appear next to it will remind you of anything you need to be aware of when engaging and trying to capture that creature.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>What you do next will depend on the size of the creature you're trying to capture. Most creatures will require you to stun them in some way, usually by hitting a weak spot with your blaster. Others don't need that kind of preamble. You can just hold your whip button until you're swinging it over your head like a lasso. You'll be able to tell if it can be captured if a small circle appears on the creature, signifying that your whip is locked on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Once you've locked onto the creature, release your whip and you'll start a small tug-of-war mini-game with the creature. Just keep the whip button held, and so long as you're not interrupted, you'll pull the creature close enough to capture it.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/">Empty Vessel</a>, the studio founded by former id Software developers and comprised of people who've worked on Doom, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Uncharted, and more, has just closed out its series A round of funding for its debut project, DEFECT, with&nbsp;<strong>$11 million</strong> total raised from this round.</p>
<p>The additional funds will allow Empty Vessel to expand the team, per a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/emptyvessel-Expands-DEFECT-Game-Development-with-Series-A-Close">press release</a>, and scale to the point where they can work on bringing DEFECT to consoles, and add support for single-player experiences on top of DEFECT already being a multiplayer-focused game.</p>
<p>When we last heard about DEFECT and Empty Vessel, it was with news that NCSOFT had made "<em>a strategic equity investment</em>" in the studio to help DEFECT get out the door, so it's no surprise that NCSOFT was one of the companies that led this series A round of funding, alongside 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Official Reveal Trailer (Unreal In Engine) | Wishlist Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IScUN3ZYeR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>It's gratifying to see our developer-first approach resonating with fans and our new long-term partners at NCSOFT alongside our other investors</em>," said chief executive officer at Empty Vessel and game director on DEFECT, Emmanuel Palalic.</p>
<p>"<em>We remain committed to our vision of creating a new genre in the FPS market with DEFECT, and while we are building in a sustainable manner, this new investment will allow us to accelerate our plans for proper single-player support and to expand onto more platforms</em>."</p>
<p>For NCSOFT, the chief executive officer of NC America, and chief operating officer of NC West, Jeonghee 'JJ' Jin added "<em>Empty Vessel's distinct vision for game design, production, and player interaction made us quick believers in their upcoming shooter, DEFECT. We're committed to the evolution and future of this incredible game</em>."</p>
<p>1AM Gaming's managing director, Gregory Milken added "<em>We believe that Empty Vessel is a unique studio working on an amazing game, so we are thrilled to join them as a key investor as they work towards bringing a fresh perspective for first person shooter games with DEFECT</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, a digital fantasy tabletop adventure game set in the Forgotten Realms, will be released later this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and VR (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamVR</a>, Meta Horizon, PSVR2). The news came today from developer Resolution Games, which previously made Demeo. Compared to that game, though, the D&amp;D licensed game will feature more narrative.</p>
<p>Tommy Palm, founder and CEO of Resolution Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>While the world of Demeo is rich with lore, our previous titles focus primarily on tactical action over motivation and narrative. With DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, story is just as important as combat, so we’ve rebalanced our approach to make sure we can deliver more of it. With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the Demeo Action Roleplaying System.</em></p>
<p>To improve in this area, Resolution Games hired legendary story designer Matt Sernett as the project’s narrative lead. Sernett previously worked as a designer for the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS tabletop game and contributed to DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS video games such as the classics Baldur’s Gate, Baldur’s Gate II, and Icewind Dale. More recently, he contributed to the narrative of Bungie's Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Matt Sernett added:</p>
<p><em>When DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS launched the fifth edition back in 2014, the first adventure that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for Battlemarked players to begin their journey. The first adventure in Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of D&amp;D is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.</em></p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of another D&amp;D licensed game in development at Giant Skull, the new studio founded by former God of War and Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. That game will be a single player action/adventure title.</p>
