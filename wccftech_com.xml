			<p>Remember Bad Robot Games? The gaming studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-tencent-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded around seven and a half years ago</a> by Bad Robot's JJ Abrams, in partnership with Tencent. It was supposed to bring JJ Abrams' SPYJINX project, originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-partners-chair-create-spyjinx-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> a decade ago, to fruition. In April 2020, it seemed like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-and-bad-robots-spyjinx-resurfaces-as-a-mobile-game-beta-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were still working on it as a mobile game</a>, but the project was eventually quietly canceled.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's not all Bad Robot Games was doing. In February 2021, former Left 4 Dead creator Michael S. (better known as Mike) Booth <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-robot-games-is-working-on-an-awesome-coop-multiplayer-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he had joined the team to create an outstanding cooperative multiplayer shooter game.</p>



<p>Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it has signed on as a partner to produce and publish this title, which will be released for PC and PlayStation 5. Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe. With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</em></p>



<p>Christian Svensson, VP and Head of 2P/3P Content Ventures &amp; Strategic Initiatives at Sony Interactive Entertainment, added:</p>



<p><em>We’re greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game. Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE’s mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can’t wait for gamers to step into the world they’ve been building.</em></p>



<p>There are no further details, so the game's status is unclear. Still, Bad Robot Games has been working on it for a considerable amount of time, as outlined above. Hopefully, that means it won't be long until we can play it. </p>

			<p>This week's GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the full list of PC games being added to the cloud platform's library in December 2025. </p>



<p>One of these games is 2023's best-selling title by Avalanche Software, Hogwarts Legacy. Moreover, GeForce NOW users are finally getting access to the first Activision titles to be made available on Ubisoft+. As you might recall, part of the deal that unlocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the sale of cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</a>. Subscribers to Ubisoft+ Premium can now play games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy on GFN, with more to be added later.</p>



<p>Today, NVIDIA kicks off the Half-Price Holiday sale. Premium GeForce NOW memberships are available now through December 50 (while supplies last) at 50% off for the first month for a limited time. Starting today, members can also link their Battle.net accounts directly to GFN for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices, making it easier to access Battle.net games via cloud.</p>
