<p>Regarding what's available right now, two classic RPGs are being added to the service today, the first two Baldur's Gate games. The Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are available on Xbox Game Pass console and cloud today, with the other eight games spread throughout the month.</p>

<p>Here's the full list of everything coming to Game Pass this month, and when they'll be available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition - June 10 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>

<p>Microsoft also confirmed seven games that will be leaving Xbox Game Pass this month on June 15, 2025. Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>

<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Depersonalization - PC</li>
</ul>
<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility feature is looking more interesting than expected before launch, as it manages to fix the massive performance issues of Batman Arkham Knight, one of the worst ports released for its predecessor.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-back-compat-fixes-batman-arkham-knight-switch-1s-worst-triple-a-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the new-generation system from Nintendo, which has launched worldwide today, runs the horrible port of the third main entry in the series developed by Rocksteady without the massive performance issues it has on the original system. As such, the translation layer that is being used on the new system to run the original code has proven to be effective, allowing the game to put the better specs of the Switch 2 to good use. Ultimately, there's no fixing for the compromises the port's developer had to make in terms of texture quality and lack of antialiasing, and there are still some stability issues, but the fact that the Switch 2 can brute force better performance in backward-compatible titles is quite promising.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid game, Batman Arkham Knight has been somewhat infamous since its release due to the horrible state it launched in on PC, which required multiple patches to fix. The late Nintendo Switch port of the game, which launched last year, is equally infamous for being absolutely terrible, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">running at a whopping 0 FPS in certain scenarios.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally launched worldwide, but not everyone is having a good release day. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-here-and-for-some-players-their-consoles-are-already-damaged-thanks-to-stores-stapling-holes-into-the-switch-2-screen/">earlier today</a>, some early adopters found their unit's screen damaged because store employees stapled their receipts in front of the console's box.</p>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch day, a day that's supposed to be exciting for players and developers alike, with a new Nintendo console in the market and hopefully, plenty of new experiences on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some players though, are definitely getting the kind of 'new experience' with their Switch 2 they didn't ask for, and that's the experience of their brand-new console already being broken, before they even opened the box.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">IGN</a>, some players who went to retail GameStop locations to pick up their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles through midnight launches got home to discover that there were <a href="https://x.com/Rudeboy__NYC/status/1930568461014499667">holes in the console's screen</a>, from <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">store employees stapling their receipts to the front of the Nintendo Switch 2 box</a>.</p>
<p>This happened to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">number of players</a> who went to the same GameStop in Staten Island, where it seems everyone who was at that location walked away with their receipt stapled to the front of the Switch 2 box.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu">
<p lang="en">Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed">Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed">2025-06-05T07:18:39.993Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone who went to that same GameStop, they will probably have to wait until that store gets its next shipment of Switch 2 consoles, to get their replacements. Though, the reaction online hasn't been all negative towards GameStop alone. Many players on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davefpg.bsky.social/post/3lqua356xqk23">social media</a> have also noted that Nintendo should've packaged the console better, and not have the screen facing up at the top of the box.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo repackages the Switch 2 in response to these issues, or if any more reports of retail employees puncturing holes in the screen crop up. Plenty of stores across the globe had midnight launches, including the newly-separated, Canadian-owned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/">EB Games</a>, and more reports of this happening at other stores have yet to be spotted. For now, it looks like this lone Staten Island store is the 'what not to do' example for everyone else.</p>

			<p>Funcom's survival multiplayer sandbox game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a> launches today for those who have purchased the Deluxe and Ultimate editions and it features NVIDIA DLSS 4 support for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The game includes support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available on all RTX GPUs), Frame Generation (available on RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs), and Multi Frame Generation (available on RTX 50 Series GPUs). According to NVIDIA, performance in Dune Awakening can be enhanced by an average of 4.9X at 4K resolution and max settings while activating all the above with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode. The official benchmarks show the RTX 5090 surpassing 338 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 averages 270 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti 239 FPS, and the RTX 5070 198 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Optionally, users can turn on the NVIDIA app override to improve DLSS quality in the game with the new transformer model. Lastly, Dune Awakening also supports NVIDIA Reflex, which NVIDIA says can reduce system latency by up to 50% in this title. As a reminder, if your PC simply isn't strong enough to run Dune Awakening, you can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-dune-awakening-fbc-firebreak-mindseye-and-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play it via GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Codemasters launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports F1 25</a>, this year's edition of the licensed Formula One racing game. This title actually supports the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite. On top of the aforementioned DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, the game also includes Ray Reconstruction, which can be enabled to replace the built-in denoiser to greatly enhance the quality of the ray tracing/<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path tracing</a>. NVIDIA says that enabling all DLSS technologies can multiply performance in F1 25 by an average of 7.9X at 4K with Ultra High settings and path tracing during a race around a wet Bahrain at night with 20 cars. The RTX 5090 breaks 372 frames per second, the RTX 5080 averages 246 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 206 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the GeForce Summer of RTX promotion <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/contests/summer-of-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is returning</a>. They encouraged users to follow GeForce and GeForce NOW accounts on social media to stay up to date on prize bundles featuring GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, GeForce RTX gaming PCs from Falcon Northwest, Maingear, and ORIGIN, and even more prizes coming later this season. Also, they are kicking off a new promotion titled RTX Watch &amp; Win: when new trailers drop during the biggest shows like the upcoming Summer Game Fest, participants have a chance to win Steam gift cards via NVIDIA's social pages.</p>
