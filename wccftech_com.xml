			<p>Today, Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games announced a rather unusual offer. They'll be giving away free digital copies of the game (presumably handing out redeemable codes) at London Comic-Con in three weeks, on Friday, May 23. There's a pretty big caveat, though: you have to be celebrating your Steel Wedding (11-year) anniversary on May 22. That means you only get a free copy if you were married on May 22, 2014, and can bring a wedding certificate (or copy/photo) attesting to this.</p>
<p>The seemingly arbitrary date is obviously a reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's launch date</a>, set for May 22, 2025 on PC (only <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-f8178f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, at least for now), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be priced at $59.99, although there's a 10% pre-order discount available now on PC and Xbox. PlayStation users can also get the same discount, but only if they have an active PlayStation Plus subscription. As a side note, if you want to play on PC but don't have a good enough hardware (the system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly demanding</a>), the game will be playable via cloud <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-get-doom-the-dark-ages-blades-of-fire-and-more-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire had a relatively short marketing period, having been revealed only in late February. However, MercurySteam has shared many details on the action/adventure game since. The title is set in a fantasy world where the evil queen Nerea has magically turned everyone's steel into stone, making it impossible to challenge her rule. However, protagonist Aran de Lira receives a unique hammer that isn't affected by the curse and sets out on a journey to take her down.</p>
<p>Forging weapons is, therefore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big part of the game</a>. Not only are there seven weapon families and 30 Forge Scrolls, but even the choice of materials will greatly influence the crafted weapon, leading to many different combinations. It will be up to the player to choose the right tool for the job, too, as weapons can have wildly different efficiencies depending on the enemy's armor. With over 50 enemy types, players will have to keep track of each one's strengths and weaknesses. The combat system also lets players attack specific body parts.</p>
<p>MercurySteam also <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Blades of Fire is narrative-driven. At the same time, players will decide how much they want to know about the story. One way to do that is by engaging in dialogue with Aran's companion, the young scholar Adso de Zelk, who is something of a human encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going hands-on with the game at GDC 2025</a>, Kai Tatsumoto was quite interested in the final game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive warhammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>By the way, a new Blades of Fire trailer will go live later today during Future Game Show's Gamescom LATAM edition. We'll update this story once it is available.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, Moon Studios released the big Breach update for its game No Rest for the Wicked. In early access since May 2024, the action role-playing game received a lot of new content, starting with brand-new quests and new high-quality cinematic animation delivered through 18 new story scenes. The world size has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, which also include a dangerous new Blight hazard that players must beware of. There are also two new settlements, Hunter's Vale and Marin Village, and several dark caves to explore.</p>
<p>The Breach update has introduced a new endgame Plague System as well, while the Food and Hunger mechanic has been reworked and Status Effects have been overhauled. Of course, a game like this one is heavily focused on loot. No Rest for the Wicked now offers over 150 weapon options, an increase of 50 compared to launch. This includes new Gauntlet and Wand types. There are also multiple new armor sets and a rework for the Shield. Throughout the campaign, players will encounter several new boss fights (and 3 updated ones), 9 new Plague bosses, 2 new enemy factions, and 9 new critters. Those who really seek a challenge when playing the game can now activate the Hardcore mode, which enables permadeath.</p>
<p>The audio was improved with new music by Gareth Coker and new voice-overs. Moon Studios also touts extensive balance changes, quality-of-life improvements (updated item previews, tooltips), and noticeable performance improvements, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, memory usage optimizations, quicker load times, and improved physics. Lastly, the patch features 'hundreds of bug fixes'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update hasn't been well-received by No Rest for the Wicked players. Recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mostly Negative' due to a very low 36% score. Hopefully, the developers can get to the bottom of the community's feedback. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our hands-on report from May 2024</a>, the game's core does have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Austrian developer is now fully on its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having purchased the license back from publisher Private Division</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918062881930711315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an updated Overwatch 2 roadmap when it comes to the new Stadium Mode. According to the studio, this is currently the most played game mode by far, eclipsing Competitive and Quick Play modes. There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during the mode's launch week, and that's apparently more than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week (when OW Classic was added to Overwatch 2). In the mode's first week, 900 billion in Stadium cash were collectively earned, and 206 million items were chosen by players during rounds. Ironically, the most successful and yet also the least popular hero was Lucio.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest expressed by fans, Blizzard also took a step back to reveal its development history. Stadium was initially set up as an eight-team tournament that should have been as varied as possible. Each round, players would choose from random upgrades to use in PvP Team Deathmatch or PvE against the AI, losing health if they lost the round. However, it was challenging to develop a coherent strategy or build to counter opponents when decisions were made at random. Now, Blizzard still wants there to be variety from match to match, but it is no longer the top priority. The goal has shifted towards delivering a balanced and competitive mode, while at the same time allowing players to create epic builds through strategic decisions based on the performance and hero combinations of everyone in the match.</p>
<p>Stadium mode will have its builds and Hero balance tweaked in an upcoming mid-season balance patch after Blizzard has collected all the data and feedback. When it comes to new content, the latest hero (Freya) will also be the next to be available in the mode when the midseason patch goes live in Overwatch 2. That's just the beginning, as Blizzard wants to release new heroes on a regular basis to Stadium. Season 17, slated to debut next month, will introduce Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta, in addition to the new maps of Esperanca and Samoa, Custom Games, the ability to save and share builds, and crossplay. It's important to note that this is still a Competitive game mode, which means PC and console players will be in separate groups. However, the developers are looking into coming up with an Unranked mode which could bring everyone together without harming the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Season 18 will land in August, adding Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte as new Stadium heroes. Players will also find two new maps (New Route 66 and London), the new game mode Payload race, new All-Star Rewards, and the Stadium Trials feature. From Season 19 onward, Overwatch 2 will get a New China map, new heroes with every season, Draft Mode, new consumables, and item upgrades. With Payload race, Blizzard is also adding a new mechanic called Quests, where players will select a random quest that will provide rewards when completed.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with adding in-game perks. It seems like they're finally willing to shake up the game's core after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzards-steam-debut-stumbles-hard-as-overwatch-2-becomes-worst-reviewed-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly underwhelming launch</a>.</p>
