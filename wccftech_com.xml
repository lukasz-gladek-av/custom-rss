			<p>Capcom is hosting a 90-minute long panel at New York City Comic-Con later this year in October, where it will showcase "<em>recent and upcoming releases</em>" in its portfolio.</p>



<p>It's currently the next big showcase we're aware of for Capcom, as the company will also be in Germany next week for Gamescom, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> featured at the annual showcase. Reported by <a href="https://ew.com/new-york-comic-con-2025-panels-game-of-thrones-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-x-men-reunion-exclusive-11790222">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the panel will take place at the con's main stage on Friday, October 10, 2025, at 3:45pm.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Capcom brings to the 90-minute showcase, as for now we can only speculate that it'll be more on Requiem ahead of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">February 2026 release</a>, and potentially another look at the recently announced mobile game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">Resident Evil Survival Unit</a>.</p>



<p>We could also potentially get a better look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, which we know is due out on Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year, but no release date has been provided yet.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll get a reveal of a brand new game in the Devil May Cry series, which hasn't had a new entry since 2019's Devil May Cry 5, though it was still the company's<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/"> best-selling game in the first quarter of Capcom's FY2026.</a></p>



<p>Again, this is all just speculation, since New York City Comic-Con hasn't previously been a hot-bed for videogame related announcements and reveals. Anything like a new DMC game or a new game in general is probably being saved for a more game-specific stage, like The Game Awards, which will be about two months away at the time of the panel in October.</p>



<p>Regardless, it'll be interesting to see how Capcom fills up that 90-minute block, and hopefully it's not just news about games in its portfolio that are already out.</p>
