			<p>As anyone familiar with the Dune series knows, "<em>A beginning is the time for taking the most care that the balances are correct</em>," a mantra that's true for plenty of situations in life, and for starting a new character in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>When you begin your adventure on Arrakis, you'll go through a character creation process that feels like it has huge importance to it - and it mostly does.</p>
<p>But at the same time, some of the choices available to you don't have as much of an impact on your journey as they might seem to, if you're someone who is very into Dune lore and the politicking that the series is known for.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through all the choices you'll face in the opening character creation process, and which ones really matter.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - The Best Character Creation Choices and Which Ones Really Matter</h2>
<h3>Which Choices Really Matter</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Starting with what means the most, the choice that actually matters, and I say choice because out of the three core choices you're given in the character creation, the only one that really matters is your <strong>mentor/class</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to train in every class throughout your journey on Arrakis, so whoever you pick first is just that - the class you'll start out with. But it is the choice out of all the character creation options that has the biggest impact on your early game playtime.</p>
<p>Your caste and selecting which world you're from don't play as huge of a gameplay role, and are more there for you to role-play in the world of Dune: Awakening more than anything. You'll see the fruits of your choices play out in certain dialogue options, but overall they won't have nearly as strong of an impact on your time in Dune: Awakening, especially the early hours of your journey, as your choice of mentor/class.</p>
<h3>The Best Character Creation Choices</h3>

<figure></figure>

<h4>Class/Mentor</h4>
<p>While you can be effective with any choice for your mentor/class, there is an obvious answer for which one is the best to start with, giving you the biggest advantage in the early game.</p>
<p>Dune-heads will be unsurprised to learn that the best choice for a mentor in the game is also the most logical choice according to the lore, which is <strong>Mentat.</strong> Choosing Mentat for your starting class means you'll start with the Sentinel turret, which will be invaluable for taking out enemies at camps and testing stations in the early game.</p>
<p>Bene Gesserit is arguably the second-best choice, because of the Bindu Sprint ability you'll be able to unlock early. Before you're able to craft a vehicle, having an ability that lets you cross great distances quickly while on foot is a huge boon when trying to avoid open sand as much as possible.</p>
<p>Swordmaster falls third, though not by much, as the Bindu Sprint is what really pulls picking Bene Gesserit up the ladder. Both starting classes won't be as big of a help with early game combat as starting with Mentat will.</p>
<p>Trooper has the unique distinction of technically being a pretty good starting choice, but also more realistically the worst pick, because the first trainer you'll meet is the one who will open the Trooper skill tree for you. The Shigawire Claw, which is a very useful grapple hook, is easily one of the best abilities in the game, though you can get it so early on from the basic-level Trooper trainer, it's nearly pointless to pick Trooper as your starting class.</p>
<p>Mentat, Bene Gesserit, and Swordmaster trainers are all discovered a bit later on, so you're much better off picking any of them to open up a skill tree you'd otherwise need to play hours to access, while still being able to get the best part of the Trooper skill tree from the beginning of the game.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Class/Mentor</strong></td>
<td><strong>Skill Tree Focus</strong></td>
<td><strong>Starting Ability</strong></td>
</tr>

<td>Bene Gesserit</td>
<td>Physical Mastery &amp; Manipulation</td>
<td>Voice: Compel - Use The Voice to force someone towards your position from afar.</td>

<td>Knee Charge - Propel yourself forward into battle with a terrific knee charge into the enemy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trooper</td>
<td>Offense &amp; Demolition</td>
<td>Shigawire Claw - Shoot a barb that attaches to a surface, than rapidly pulls you towards that position.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Homeworld</h4>
<p>As already stated, your choice of homeworld in Dune: Awakening isn't really all that significant, and more so depends on how you'd like to role-play within your journey on Arrakis.</p>
<p>If you needed to pick one, then you could make an argument for Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. The dialogue trait you'll get with this is Deception, and being able to lie your way out of sticky situations when they arise is always useful on Arrakis.</p>
<p>Similarly, choosing Kaitain, the home base of the Imperium, is also not a bad choice, as you'll acquire the Political dialogue trait.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the opportunity to pick a dialogue option based on the trait you chose at the beginning of the game doesn't crop up enough, especially in the early game, for any of these choices to really stand out as 'best.' The only other element of picking a homeworld is that you get a unique emote. So, once again, basically no impact on gameplay.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Homeworld</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dialogue Trait</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unique Emote</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>Caladan</td>
<td>Honorable</td>
<td>Atreides Salute</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kaitain</td>
<td>Political</td>
<td>Kaitain Bow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ix</td>
<td>Technologist</td>
<td>Ixian Secret</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Caste</h4>
<p>Your choice of caste does give you a separate dialogue trait, but once again it has little to no impact on your gameplay, particularly in the early hours of your journey. Just like your choice in homeworld, this is more about how you want to role-play within Dune: Awakening.</p>
