			<p>Half-Life 3 is a game that no fan of the series thought would ever see the light of day. Although the game hasn't been revealed yet, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"><strong>numerous indications over the past few months that Valve may be working on a new entry in the series</strong></a>. However, if the wait for an announcement is becoming unbearable, you can get a glimpse of the potential future of the series in a new look at the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/"><strong>Half-Life 2 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A new look at one of the most impressive modding projects, powered by NVIDIA's modding tool, was provided a few days ago by a new comparison video from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">MxBench</strong><strong>m</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">arkPC</strong></a>. The video compares the vanilla release with the latest version of the project, which incorporates significant improvements over its initial launch.</p>



<p>Although the performance hit on an RTX 5080 GPU is considerable, the new PBR assets, GPU and CPU performance improvements, lighting enhancements, improved volumetric fog and water, and the new tonemapper which prevents image from being too bright make this mod worth a try for fans of the series who want to experience the game like never before.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 3 is no longer a fever dream of fans of the series, but a concrete possibility. Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/">rumored 2025 announcement</a></strong> of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">project known as HLX</a></strong> may not materialize, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Valve is undoubtedly actively working on it</a></strong>, adding new features to the Source 2 engine over the past few months that will likely be incorporated into the game. Some of these will reportedly make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">Half-Life 3 a very immersive experience</a></strong> that should make the wait since the launch of Half-Life:Alyx well worth it.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, a massive wave of layoffs at Xbox affected several gaming projects, including announced titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/"><strong>a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online</strong></a>, and many others. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">The next unannounced project by Romero Games</a></strong>, the studio created by DOOM series creator John Romero, was also cancelled, but today, it has been confirmed that it has been saved, and though its scope has been changed, it will be an innovative experience in the vein of FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@htdreams"><strong>Andrés De Pedro Álvarez</strong></a>, speaking at the Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 last week, the creator of the DOOM series confirmed that the unannounced project has been saved. However, the game has been redesigned and has become something different despite incorporating many elements from the title canceled earlier this year.</p>



<p>Though the DOOM series creator couldn't get into specifics other than the fact that the game is much smaller than before, he did say that he has never played a game like this shooter before. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience,"</em> Romero said. </p>



<p>Comparing the game to a masterpiece like FromSoftware's is definitely bold, but also very exciting, especially coming from the developer that contributed to the creation of the genre with Wolfenstein 3D and its establishment with the DOOM and Quake series.</p>

<p>The confirmation that the next project from Romero Games has been saved is rather welcome, but not entirely surprising. Following the cancellation of the game that Xbox would have published, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/"><strong>the studio had not closed and was evaluating opportunities from other publishers</strong></a>. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the first glimpses of a game that already sounds very interesting.</p>
