			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may support mesh shaders, judging from some recently datamined information that has been shared online this week.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/watertoon.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watertoon</a>, the code of the Nintendo Switch Online playtest, which was held in the past few days for a new unannounced game, reportedly features support for mesh shaders and 4K resolution, neither of them supported by the current console. Considering how the Japanese company's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a>, there's a very good chance that these features will be supported by the yet-to-be-revealed console.</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;<span>it being almost 2025, we are still relying on rumors to learn more about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like this could be going on for a little while longer. According to analysts, a reveal before January is unlikely, as Nintendo wouldn't want the announcement of an upcoming system to impact sales of the current console and its software, which haven't been doing too well</span>&nbsp;in the past quarter.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console is launching next year, but it has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>A new entry in the Virtua Fighter series has finally been confirmed to be in the works today.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a> about bringing back classic SEGA franchises like Shinobi and Set Radio across games, movies, and TV, global head of transmedia Justin Scarpone casually confirmed that a new entry in the fighting game series that has been left dormant for years is in development. While nothing else was added about the game, it is very nice to know that the series is about to make a grand comeback.</p>
<p>While welcome, the confirmation of a new Virtua Fighter game currently being in development is hardly surprising, as SEGA somewhat brought the franchise back with Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, an enhanced remake of the fifth entry in the series, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2021. The game bested the publisher's expectations, who did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-successful-future-games-considered/">future plans for the series</a>, which are coming to fruition with the newly announced game, rumored to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-reboot-details/">reboot</a> launching on all major platforms complete with cross-platform play support and rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest entry in the series, Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, on its <a href="https://virtuafighter5us.sega.com/lang/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
