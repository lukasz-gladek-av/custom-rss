			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/">Valorant</a> is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary on June 2, 2025, which is why a key focus to Act III will be celebrating the game's biggest moments in the last five years.</p>
<p>Act III and the new battle pass will be live tomorrow, April 30, 2025, featuring a special series of anniversary cards that are meant to highlight Valorant's history, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Duelists Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Cypher's Revenge Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Can't Slow Me Down Card</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Riot's lead for Valorant, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Anna Donlon</a>, spoke about the changes the game has gone through in the last five years and the state of the world when Riot first started to launch Valorant and get players into the game.</p>
<p>She also talked about how the Valorant team at Riot is working to fix some of the longstanding issues the game has faced in the last five years, and that more information regarding those fixes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if those fixes result in any major changes for the game. Some live service games, like Apex Legends, have been through tumultuous changes in recent years as Respawn has tried to satisfy a player base that was growing increasingly unsatisfied with the state of the game. Those same big swings might not happen here, but the potential is there, as Donlon specifically calls out balancing abilities, which could have a huge impact for a hero shooter.</p>
