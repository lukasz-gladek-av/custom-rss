			<p>Back in July of 2021, Razer <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-x-lucidsound-ls15p-wireless-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released the Barracuda X multi-platform wireless headset</a>, and some months ago, the brand launched an updated version called Barracuda X Chroma. As I've been quite impressed with the original 2021 model, I was happy to test out the new X Chroma model. Here are my thoughts about this illuminated multi-platform model.</p>
<h4>Design and features</h4>
<p>I was supplied with the White Edition of the X Chroma, which matches the white design of both PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. For those who don't like the white version, there's also a regular black-colored model.</p>
<p>The X Chroma comes with a USB-C transmitter for wireless audio transmission on basically all devices that have a USB-C port. As Microsoft uses its own wireless audio solution, the X Chroma doesn't work on Xbox. Razer has also supplied a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable, which is ideal for PC or docked Nintendo Switch use. It's interesting to note that while the original Barracuda X came with a 3.5mm audio port, the X Chroma doesn't.</p>

<p>Like the original model, the X Chroma is made mostly from plastic, likely to save weight and cut down on manufacturing costs. It's not all plastic, though; Razer's offering has an inner-metal headband that makes the headset feel sturdy.</p>
<p>The earcups of Razer's new outing are wrapped in breathable memory foam cushions that twist flat to rest comfortably around your neck or lie down on a desk. Like its older sibling, the X Chroma comes with Razer's TriForce 40mm drivers</p>
<p>Compared to the original Barracuda X, the X Chroma packs an upgraded detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone for communication. In addition, as the name implies, the new Barracuda comes with Chroma RGB lighting. It's a nice new addition, although you don't see it while wearing the headset. For streamers, however, the RBG lighting does add to the overall appeal.</p>
<h4>Comfort</h4>
<p>The new X Chroma weighs 285gr, a few grams heavier than the original model but still lightweight and lighter than plenty of rival headsets.</p>
<p>Although the padding on the earcups is pretty thin, comfort is good—even during longer gaming sessions. Due to the materials used, there's not much heat build-up. The low weight adds to the overall sense of comfort, and I would say that comfort is on par with that of the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-ps4-switch-amazing-all-round-on-the-go-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless</a>.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>
<p data-start="0" data-end="278">The Razer X Chroma headset is an excellent plug-and-play option, much like its predecessor. It's incredibly easy to set up, and the mobile Razer app provides a nice touch, allowing users to tweak settings such as lighting, EQ presets, Do Not Disturb mode, and Bluetooth options.</p>
<p data-start="280" data-end="808">When it comes to wireless performance, the X Chroma is on point. The signal remains clear, even when you're farther away from the transmitter, making it reliable for long gaming sessions. The sound quality is lively and engaging, with a solid overall experience. As expected from gaming headsets, the mids are a bit subdued, and some of the higher frequencies can get a little lost in the low-end sounds. However, much like the original model, the X Chroma delivers a balanced sound profile that works well for various gaming genres.</p>
<p data-start="810" data-end="1093" data-is-last-node="">One of the most notable upgrades in the X Chroma is the microphone. The new detachable boom mic performs impressively, offering clear, natural voice capture with excellent background noise reduction. This makes it a standout feature, especially considering the headset's price range.</p>

<h4>Battery</h4>
<p>The 2021 model of the original Barracuda X lasted around 23 hours on a single charge, but the 2022 model came with considerably longer battery life - around 50 hours with normal volume levels. With the new X Chroma model, Razer boasts that it can last around 70 hours on a single charge; that's around 40% more than the 2022 model. Hence, this is with Chroma RGB lighting disabled. During testing, we managed to get around 71 hours of juice out of the battery when not using the Chroma lighting. When turned on, battery life drops to roughly 30 hours on a single charge. Pretty impressive, especially compared to other outings in this segment.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The Razer X Chroma builds on the strengths of the Barracuda X, offering impressive wireless performance, a much-improved microphone, and exceptional battery life. Despite its lightweight construction, the headset feels sturdy and remains comfortable for long gaming sessions, thanks to its breathable memory foam ear cushions and minimal heat build-up. Setting it up is effortless, and the Razer app provides useful customization options. Sound quality is well-balanced and engaging, while the detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone delivers clear voice capture with excellent noise reduction. The real standout is the battery life—lasting up to 70 hours without RGB, far exceeding many competitors. For its price, the X Chroma delivers a strong mix of comfort, features, and longevity, making it a great option for gamers looking for reliability and value.</p>
