			<p>Announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">last month</a>, the latest batch of DLC levels for Astro Bot have officially been added to the game today, and as an additional surprise, two iconic characters that are recognized by video game fans around the world have finally joined the roster of the cameo bots that players can collect in each level. </p>



<p>Today's update adds another five levels to Astro Bot, putting the total number of levels in Astro Bot over 90, but what's perhaps more significant to diehard PlayStation fans are two of the characters that have finally made their way into the game as cameo bots. </p>

<p>Final Fantasy's Cloud and Sephiroth are now part of the roster of cameo bots that players can collect in the five new levels available today. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable cameo bot inclusions are Atsu, the protagonist for Sucker Punch's upcoming follow-up to their 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, which is also due to have its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/">own State of Play presentation</a> later today at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for collectors, there's no update regarding the other announcement from last month's Astro Bot news, which was the reveal of a new limited-edition Astro Bot-themed DualSense controller. For now, it's still due out "<em>later this year</em>," with no official release date revealed. </p>

			<p>Today, White Owls announced the release window of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOTEL BARCELONA</a>. The new game from revered creators Hidetaka 'Swery' Suehiro (Deadly Premonition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-good-life-team-dog-or-team-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a>) and Goichi 'Suda51' Suda (Killer7, No More Heroes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows of the Damned</a>, Lollipop Chainsaw, Let It Die) will be available in September for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. </p>



<p> The game is a 2.5D sidescroller/slasher featuring roguelite and action game elements. It is set in a mysterious hotel, located in a remote location on the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. Its luxurious appearance hides a terrifying truth—it’s a trap for America’s most dangerous serial killers. Players step into the role of Justine, a rookie federal marshal with a deadly secret—her mind is connected to Dr. Carnival, a deranged murderer with a violent past. Together, Justine and Dr. Carnival must eliminate the Seven Slash Killers and try to survive long enough to escape.</p>



<p>Hotel Barcelona has seven unique explorable areas, each inspired by a different subgenre of horror, such as haunted mansions or twisted laboratories. Each zone features an unforgettable boss battle.</p>

<p>Each time Justine dies, a memory of her past self is born. These echoes, known as Slasher Phantoms, mimic the previous run's movements and can harm enemies. Clever players may use them as shields, allies, or distractions. Thus, with each failure, their strength increases.</p>



<p>The game even supports an online multiplayer mode that can be unlocked. Up to three players can team up in co-op mode to work together to complete missions and survive the hotel's murderous inhabitants. For those seeking a more competitive thrill, PvP mode allows a fourth player to invade your world, where you can hunt or be hunted in a brutal game of cat and mouse.</p>



<p>HOTEL BARCELONA is playable at BitSummit XIII: Summer of Yōkai, Japan's largest indie game festival. From July 18 to 20 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, attendees can experience the game's opening section, including its brutal first boss, Jacob, a baseball-obsessed serial killer rumored to strike every few years at the nearby baseball field of the hotel.</p>
