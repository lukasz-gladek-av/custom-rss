			<p>The yet-to-be-announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is reportedly scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">this month</a>, but it shouldn't be expected to become available this week, judging from what a reliable insider said in the past few days.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known insider NateTheHate reiterated that the game will be released in the second half of the month, so its launch shouldn't be expected this week. While the precise release date hasn't been confirmed, the insider suggested with another comment that the remake could be released close to April 21st, as an X user who celebrates their birthday on that day could consider the game a birthday gift.</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be close enough that you could consider it a birthday gift.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1908664050545840312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, it has quickly become one of the worst-kept video game secrets of the past few years. Funnily enough, the game wasn't revealed by insiders but by Bethesda's owner, Microsoft, in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> held with Xbox's head, Phil Spencer. Unfortunately, every other piece of information known about the game, such as its developer, which should be known porting and support studio Virtuos, its engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay changes</a> it should feature, has yet to be confirmed, but if the remake is indeed releasing in the second half of the month, the wait won't be much longer not just to see it in action, but to experience it ourselves.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">The Outlast Trials</a> Season 2.2 update is arriving today, and it's the last major update ahead of the Season 3 launch later this month on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Update 2.2 of the Project Breach season will have players trying to defy Murkoff and escape his torture house of experiments that turn your guts inside out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-breach-update-for-the-outlast-trials-now-live-introducing-amelia-collier/">Amelia Collier</a> has hacked into his system, providing a small window of opportunity for the Reagents to get out of dodge while they can.</p>
<p><strong>The Escape</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Under Surveillance Part II</strong> are the two new trials added with this update. In the former, you'll work together with up to four Reagents to get to the Sleep Room, interact with the terminal and get the escape plan in order. The latter will task you with finding the escape plans scattered all across the trials, and finding Amelia's escape message before Murkoff does. You can't escape the Murkoff Institution otherwise, so you'll want to make the most out of your one chance to escape.</p>
<p>The update also adds the Amelia catalog of cosmetics, allowing you to don her look to show your support in the liberation effort. You can unlock the cosmetics by grabbing event tokens from certain tasks in the Under Surveillance trials. And of course, make sure to use them as the event tokens will be gone once the event is over, and the new Season 3 update arrives on April 22.</p>
<p>Speaking of things to do in The Outlast Trials before April 22, this update is also your last chance to experience Rebirth, before the mode is suspended with the Season 3 update, as Red Barrels takes some time to re-tool it. So, if you want to grab some of the legendary outfits that come with being reborn, you have about two weeks to do so at the time of writing.</p>
<p>There's currently no word on when it'll be back, so make sure to take advantage while you can. And while you wait for the update to download on your console or PC, you can check out the new The Outlast Trials trailer for update 2.2 below.</p>

			<p>A new The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC hotfix was released today, introducing a very welcome new feature and some stability improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.0 hotfix doesn't address many of the issues found in the newly released port of the second entry in the series, but it introduces definite improvements with the addition of an upscale sharpness slider that provides players improved control over sharpening. The game definitely was over-sharpened at launch, so this new feature is extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the upscale sharpness slider, the new The Last of Us Part II Remastered hotfix brings mouse input changes to improve detection of subtle aiming movements and fixes a couple of crashes happening in very specific scenarios. The full patch notes for the hotfix can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2531310/view/526465274493273361?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the PC port released last week by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">report</a>. For more information on what the Remastered version brings over the original PlayStation 4 release, you can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>
