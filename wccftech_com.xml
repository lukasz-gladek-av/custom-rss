			<p>Ever dreamed of getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC (non-player character)? Well, here's your chance, courtesy of Bethesda Game Studios and Make-A-Wish: <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction?linkId=100000340468689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there's an ongoing silent auction</a> to make this specific dream come true.</p>
<p><em>One winner will have the opportunity to work with the Bethesda Game Studios development team to create a character to appear as a video game NPC in The Elder Scrolls VI.</em></p>
<p><em>Calling all gamers and fantasy fans! This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows you to immortalize yourself in one of the most highly anticipated video games of all time, The Elder Scrolls VI. The Elder Scrolls series, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is renowned for its vast open worlds, deep lore, and immersive storytelling. With this exclusive experience, you'll work with the developers to create a custom character that will appear in the game, leaving your mark on the legendary franchise.</em></p>
<p>The only issue is that, well, the auction is already well beyond the means of any regular gamer. Right now, the bid is at $10.5K, and it's bound to get higher—it was at $7.1K just yesterday. There's no publicly listed end date, though one would assume you'd get notified about that kind of information after making a bid. Also, this is only available for United States residents.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have covered someone getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC. Back in November 2018, fans of the fantasy RPG franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fans-bethesda-shirley-curry-npc-tesvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned</a> Bethesda to add 'Granny' Shirley Curry, who had become beloved in the community after her YouTube videos of playing Skyrim. A few months later, Bethesda officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-elder-scrolls-vi-or-starfield-e3-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they had already scanned Curry to make her an NPC in the game. Meanwhile, modders have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-is-now-available-in-game-through-a-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> her to Skyrim.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2018 when Bethesda wanted to reassure fans about its commitment to single-player games following the unveiling of Fallout 76. It only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered production</a> around the launch of Starfield, in August 2023. The likely launch window is between late 2027 and 2028.</p>

<p>Offline modes include Free Battle, Training mode (which allows players to practice with their characters in any situation, also coming with various settings and a “Record” function), a Replay section that allows players to rewatch their favorite matches, and the Story mode that gives the opportunity to relive famous scenes from HUNTERxHUNTER and play against the CPU based on set situations. Some stages also act as tutorials to help players understand how to play on top of enjoying the 2011 anime’s iconic moments.</p>
<p>The Single mode, on the other hand, provides a variety of challenges, including the “Sky Arena” featuring a series of matches against the CPU to become the “Floor Master”. Each character also comes with a “Combo Trial”, which will challenge players to perform several combos.</p>
<p>The Story and Single modes also serve to collect “Titles,” “Profile Icons,” and Greed Island Cards - G.I. Cards - to fill your Collection and help you personalize your profile online.</p>
<p>The multiplayer supports a quality rollback netcode. Online modes include Player Matches, which are meant for casual fun, and Ranked Matches, where players can try to become “Triple Hunter”, accumulating Rank Points and scoring as high as possible. Both modes also allow players to challenge each other to gain G.I. Cards.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA VI Reportedly Planning Fortnite/Roblox-style UGC Push]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push.1111704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, the website DigiDay <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Rockstar Games has been meeting with Fortnite and Roblox creators, in addition to existing GTA content creators, about GTA VI and its purported push into user-generated content. The creators would be allowed to modify the game, presumably in the online component, to create wholly custom experiences for their fans.</p>
<p>According to the report, which comes from three anonymous insider sources, the conversations are still at an early stage. In fact, it's unclear if Rockstar would offer a cut of the revenue from their creation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-the-full-unreal-editor-later-this-year-creators-will-be-able-to-monetize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as is the case in the aforementioned games</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the developer has been making steps towards that direction for a while. The most significant instance was, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the acquisition of Cfx.re</a>, the team behind the exceedingly popular Grand Theft Auto RP FiveM mod.</p>
<p>Pete Basgen, global gaming and esports lead for WPP agency Wavemaker, told DigiDay:</p>
<p><em>It is my firm belief that the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that — to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy. It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there’s a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft.</em></p>
<p>Chad Mustard, COO of UGC gaming studio JOGO, added:</p>
<p><em>If Rockstar embraces UGC, it’s a game-changer, plain and simple. The demand for creator-driven experiences is already massive, and this could unlock unprecedented opportunities for studios like ours. The economics are proven, the audience is there, and we’re ready to build. This is the moment GTA creators have been waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps this could explain why, according to the Corsair Gaming CEO at least, GTA VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be launching sooner than we thought on PC</a>. If Rockstar really intends to push on the metaverse side of the game, it would be better to do it with as wide an audience as possible, especially since UGC and PC are practically synonymous.</p>
<p>It does seem like more developers are embracing user-generated content. Studio Wildcard did the same with ARK: Survival Ascended, opening up premium mods even on consoles. When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatted with them</a>, we learned from their partner (Overwolf's CurseForge) that they estimate playtime spent on user-generated content to be much&nbsp;bigger by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>Do you think this would be the right path for GTA VI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1891487774571626904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> via the official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 social channels that the game has sold over two million units in the first two weeks on the market. It had only taken one day to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break one million units sold</a>, although that was obviously with the help of pre-orders.</p>
<p>We don't have an official platform breakdown of the sales. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Steam data</a>, owners on the largest PC platform are estimated between 1.46 million and 1.72 million, making up the vast majority of the user base. When it comes to the concurrent player peak, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has reached 256K concurrent Steam users, which is just enough to get it on the All-Time Top 50 chart ahead of Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ_GnoOjxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week's live-streamed Q3 2024/25 earnings call</a>, Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors publicly praised developer Warhorse for their achievement, which is surpassing the publisher's expectations:</p>
<p><em>I'm just so happy and pleased with Warhorse and what they have executed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Embracer in 2019</a>, they had their vision to create a sequel of a fantastic game and we have been allowing them to pull off their vision that they wanted to do and have given them more time and the freedom to really create a masterpiece. The sales are exceeding our expectations and even my a bit higher expectations, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually achieving that, so I think it's a 'well done'. I'm really happy to see it. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and the first one for that matter as well, will continue generating substantial revenues for us for many years to come.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Warhorse is <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to release mod tools soon, which should undoubtedly increase the game's longevity on PC. Moreover, there's a whole 2025 roadmap that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicated</a>: barbers, horse racing, and Hardcore Mode in Spring; the Brushes with Death premium DLC in Summer; the Legacy of the Forge premium DLC in Autumn; and the Mysteria Ecclesiae premium DLC in Winter.</p>
<p>For our detailed review of the game, featuring a perfect score from Chris Wray, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>.</p>
