			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Spiders</strong> have announced that <strong>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</strong> will launch out of early access and into its definitive <strong>1.0 version</strong> this coming <strong>March 10, 2026,</strong> on PC, and two days later, on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> it'll arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes alongside a new gameplay overview trailer that digs into the different core aspects of Greedfall 2: The Dying World, including the game's story, the companions you'll meet along the way that fill out your adventures, combat, crafting, and more.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World launched in early access on PC on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/">September 24, 2024</a></strong>, and has seen some major updates in that time, namely its largest one yet back in <strong>November 2025</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update/">added a new region to explore, a new companion, and an overhaul to combat</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even though major updates like the aforementioned November 2025 update brought some much-needed overhaul, the game continues to struggle to gain any traction. An issue not helped by <a href="https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-allegations-made-by-stjv/">allegations of internal issues at Spiders</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-developer-lays-off-most-animation-team/"><strong>layoffs</strong> that hit the studio</a> months ahead of the one-year mark for The Dying World's early access release.</p>



<p>Wccftech checked out Greedfall right when it launched in early access in September 2024, and while there was a core to the game that was fun to play, so much of it was an unfinished and janky mess. <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">At the time, we even went so far as to say that it <strong>wasn't ready for an early access release</strong></a>. A feeling that was clearly shared by players, as noted by its negative reviews on Steam at its early access launch, and unfortunately, even recent reviews still cite major issues.</p>



<p>So far, Spiders has proclaimed that the early access version is only the first third of the game. Hopefully, with the other two-thirds and another major update that comes along with its 1.0 version, it can gain some forward momentum. We'll find out when it arrives on <strong>March 10, 2026</strong>, on PC and on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Now the Most Awarded Game of All Time, Surpassing Elden Ring Thanks to Wccftech GOTY]]></title>

			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has broken a new record, <strong>surpassing FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> when it comes to <strong>overall Game of the Year wins</strong> from press outlets and industry associations. <strong>It did so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our own Wccftech Awards '25 prizes</a></strong>, awarded by staff and community both after extensive polls.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ResetEra user Angie, who keeps a detailed record of all the Game of the Year wins for each year, revealed how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had quickly dethroned <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong> at the third spot. Now, shortly after our announcement of the Wccftech Awards '25 winners, the ResetEra thread <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-now-the-most-awarded-game-of-the-year-ever.1411252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was updated</a> with Angie claiming that our GOTY awards were just enough to surpass Elden Ring's previous record of <strong>435 GOTY prizes</strong> in a single award season. </p>



<p>Sandfall's game now <strong>sits alone at 436</strong>, and the award season is far from over. The game is extremely well-positioned to win again at upcoming events like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DICE Awards</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>. The winners of the former will be announced by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</strong> (AIAS) on Thursday, February 12, 2026, during the <strong>DICE 2026 Summit</strong> in Las Vegas. We'll have to wait a bit more to know the winners of the latter, as the GDC Awards will be unveiled on Thursday, March 12, 2026, during the <strong>Game Developers Conference 2026</strong> in San Francisco. A bit further still, the <strong>BAFTA Game Awards 2026</strong> winners will be announced on Friday, April 17, 2026, in London.</p>



<p>Those are the major ones, but there are a few others. It's not inconceivable for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to reach <strong>450 Game of the Year wins</strong> or more, which would make the record quite hard to beat in the coming years. Records aside, what's more important is that <strong>Sandfall Interactive has earned the industry's unanimous appreciation</strong>, from professionals to fans. <span>Just a few days ago, a veteran developer like&nbsp;<strong>The Astronauts</strong>' founder and director,&nbsp;<strong>Adrian Chmielarz,</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated</a> that the game's incredible quality, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved with a relatively low budget</a> and a small development team, made him question everything he thought he knew about the limits of game de</span>velopment.</p>



<p>Of course, now Sandfall Interactive has everyone's eyes on them. Will they be able to stay humble and handle the inevitable massive hype surrounding their next project? Only time will tell, but we're certainly rooting for them.</p>
