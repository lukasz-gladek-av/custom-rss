			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626350/Pekoe/">Pekoe</a> developer Kitten Cup Studio and publisher Big Blue Sky Games debuted a new trailer for Kitten Cup Studio's upcoming cozy narrative-driven puzzle game, Capy Castaway, during today's Women-Led Games 2025 Summer Showcase event as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Capy, a capybara that gets separated from their parents after a flood rushes through the zoo where they live. When Capy comes to, a small crow, Corvi, finds them, and the two vow to help each other in their search for home.</p>
<p>"<em>Capy Castaway is inspired by our hometown of Toronto and the true story of Bonnie and Clyde - the runaway capybaras from Toronto's High Park Zoo in 2016,</em>" said chief executive officer and creative director at Kitten Cup Studio, Saffron Bolduc-Chong in a press release.</p>
<p>Not only is Capy Castaway set in Toronto, it also features some Toronto talent not already in the Kitten Cup Studio development team, with an original soundtrack composed by Toronto's Mark Sparling, who previously composed the music for 2019's beloved indie game, A Short Hike.</p>
<p>"<em>The game is heavily inspired by familiar places and things that bring us joy, and we wanted to capture a sort of intuitive playfulness. When we're playing through the game and think, 'Hey, wouldn't it be fun if we could just wear this yuzu on our heads?' and then we try it out. Suddenly, you have a mechanic where you can stack 10 yuzus on your head, and I love it. We can't wait for players to experience the heartfelt story of Capy Castaway, but also to enjoy the wonder and charm of being a silly little guy."</em></p>

<p>Big Blue Sky Games president Tony Roma added "<em>We're thrilled to help bring Kitten Cup Studio's vision to life; Capy Castaway is a thoughtful, imaginative and full of heart - exactly the kind of experience we want to champion. The game's story of unlikely connection unfolds in a vibrant wold filled with peaceful gameplay, calming music and charmingly funny dialogue - one that players won't want to leave</em>."</p>
