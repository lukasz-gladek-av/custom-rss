			<p><strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> has revealed our first look at <strong>Kratos</strong> and <strong>Atreus</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV</strong> series led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>, which we had previously learned was set to start filming in <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/"><strong>March 2026</strong>,</a> has already kicked off with actors <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/"><strong>Callum Vinson</strong> </a>in full costume and makeup for their roles.</p>



<p>The image clearly depicts a scene from the very beginning of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> game, where Atreus and Kratos go hunting immediately after burning the ashes of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mom. Kratos is testing Atreus, to see if he is capable of making the journey that they are about to embark on to spread the ashes at the highest peak in all nine realms.</p>



<p>Of course, we know that the full journey encapsulates so much more than that, but as far as this first look goes, it's a pretty solid and iconic choice. The opening of the 2018 game is emotional and heavy, and this is a great callback to make for fans of the games, while also being a solid shot of the characters in their main roles of father and son.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With all of that said, the first comment under this photo, which is that this "<em>Looks like a cosplay from E3 2018</em>," and some of the other negative comments are not entirely out of line in their displeasure. God of War fans understand the importance of the scene, the costuming and makeup teams have clearly done a great job with getting everything about the look of Kratos and Atreus right, but at least in a single screenshot, it does not have the sense of magic and mythological wonder that the same scene in the game carries.</p>



<p>Maybe it's the fact that this is just a still image, with no music to support it, and that we have yet to hear how either actor sounds in these roles. Maybe once all those missing pieces are included, it'll actually look and feel how we might expect a God of War TV adaptation to look and feel.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll start to see that when we see the rest of the cast in full makeup and costume. The most recent addition to the cast came earlier this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/"><strong>Ed Skrein</strong> getting tapped to play <strong>Baldur.</strong></a> and now that the show has entered production, we'll hopefully soon learn who will be filling the last major role yet to be publicly revealed, <strong>Freya</strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, here's the list of the show's cast so far: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

			<p>Players have had <strong>a lot to say</strong> about <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> over the years. You don't have to look very hard to find positive or negative comments on Spencer and his tenure at <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, and that's probably not going to stop now that he has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/">officially retired as of this past Monday, February 23, 2026</a>.</p>



<p>However, we don't often hear from other major industry figures speaking about leaders like Spencer, and a new <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/he-truly-cared-about-games-about-the-industry-and-about-the-people-making-them-the-industry-on-phil-spencer">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> report includes a slew of the video game industry's current and former leaders all commemorating Phil Spencer as he enters retirement after a combined <strong>38 years</strong> at Microsoft, where he began as an intern in 1988.</p>



<p>In total, 13 recognizable video game industry leaders, most of whom are still working in the industry with a couple of notable retirees like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/">Shuhei Yoshida</a></strong>, all shared some thoughts on their time working with Spencer, and offered a story or two that they'll carry with them that spoke to the kind of person Spencer is and what it was like to work with him.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-two-far-cry-projects-several-assassins-creed-games-single-player-and-multiplayer/">Ubisoft</a></strong> chief executive officer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">Yves Guillemot</a></strong> and Shuhei Yoshida both called Spencer "<em>a true gamer</em>," with Yoshida specifically commenting on Spencer's skills while he was playing an early build of <a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-no-soulslike-confirms-dev/"><strong>Game Freak's</strong> upcoming <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>.</a> </p>



<p>Several of the comments also revolved around how Spencer had a talent for being able to spot quality games. <strong>Patrick Söderlund</strong>, who is now the chief executive officer of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-gave-arc-raiders-players-too-effective-abilities-take-down-matriarchs/">Embark Studios</a></strong>, shared a story about how Spencer immediately supported his vision for <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> while Söderlund was still with <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>DICE</strong>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our take on World War One was slightly different, of course, but I had to work quite hard inside of EA and externally to get people excited about the game</em>," Söderlund writes. "<em>We were out talking to partners about marketing support. <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong> and myself flew out to see Phil in Redmond with his team. <strong>No one at this point was convinced</strong>. We showed them the first trailer. The people in the room were a little bit surprised with what they saw, but Phil's immediate reaction was, 'Hell yeah, this is amazing, let's back this.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>He looked at it from the point of view: 'Is this a great game?' His instinct was spot on</em>." <strong>Rod Fergusson</strong>, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/"> current lead on <strong>Bioshock 4</strong></a>, <strong>Ago Simonetta</strong>, chief commercial officer of <strong>Stalker </strong>developers <strong>GSC Game World</strong>, and <strong>Michał Nowakowski</strong>, joint chief executive officer of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-and-esa-got-the-witcher-into-outer-space/">CD Projekt RED</a></strong>, and <strong>22Cans</strong> chief executive officer and <strong>Fable</strong> creator <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/">Peter Molyneux</a></strong> all called out Spencer's ability to spot a good game from a player's perspective, rather than an executives'.</p>



<p><strong>Mike Rose</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>No More Robots</strong> added that despite what people will say about Spencer, he "<em>tried his damn hardest with the situation he was given, and while he had the keys to the machine in his possession, Xbox was moving in promising directions</em>."</p>



<p>Arguably the most significant comment, because it comes from someone who was once in a position similar to Spencer's, came from <strong>Peter Moore</strong>, a former Xbox executive who was influential in the platforms early years.</p>



<p>"<em>History tends to smooth out the noise of the moment</em>," Moore writes. "<em>When that happens, I suspect Phil will be remembered as one of the stabilising figures in Microsoft's long journey in interactive entertainment. That's certainly how I will remember his accomplishments there. Not an easy place to work, as I can personally attest!!</em>"</p>



<p>We'll see if the new head of Xbox, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/all-studios-are-going-to-use-ai-former-xbox-sega-ea-executive-sharma/">Asha Sharma</a></strong>, is around long enough and does well enough to earn the same kind of praise from her peers.</p>
