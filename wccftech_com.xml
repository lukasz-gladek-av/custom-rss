			<p>The Fallout 76: Gleaming Depths update is now available for all Fallout 76 players for free across all platforms. For those who are in the endgame of Fallout 76, this is the perfect free update to get stuck into. This update contains the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/"> new Raids feature</a>, which long-term Fallout 76 players have highly anticipated. With this feature, players will be able to go into a former Enclave laboratory where research on Ultracite was being carried out, with the promise of reshaping Appalachia. However, the lab is now abandoned and overrun by enemies, and you will have to work together in teams of four to survive the extreme journey. If you want to see what's in store in the Fallout 76: Gleaming Depths update, Bethesda has released a launch trailer that is just under two minutes long and showcases some of the biggest features being added to the game, including the very first raid.</p>

<p>This update is revolutionary for the Fallout franchise, as it includes the biggest enemy ever created in the Fallout series. This is the Ultracite Terror, a mutated monster that you will find lurking in the Gleaming Depths. There will be tons of enemies and encounters for you and your team members to deal with while slowly working through the raid to uncover the secrets of the research operation that was taking place here.</p>
<p>Raids aren't the only thing being added in this free update to the game, as the Legendary System has now been expanded to 4-Stars, allowing players to get new 4-Star Legendary weapons, armor, and mods that can be earned from playing the Gleaming Depths raid. This update also adds in Player Titles and C.A.M.P. Pets, so you can finally pet the dog (or cat) that you've been longing to have at your base.</p>
<p>With this update comes Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This is where players will explore the Enclave, which is a deep-state faction made up of AI supercomputer M.O.D.U.S., a faction that is dedicated to rebuilding America through science. By exploring this, players will get in-game rewards for their exploration and efforts, such as the Enclave Lab Coat and Enclave Water cooler, if you want to build your base to replicate the science lab.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-says-game-developers-will-have-to-balance-human-touch-and-leveraging-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst was featured in an interview published today <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the BBC's website</a>. As you might recall, Hulst was the managing director of Guerrilla Games (Killzone, Horizon) for eighteen years. Following the success enjoyed with Horizon: Zero Dawn, Hulst was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shuhei-yoshida-replaced-hermen-hulst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted</a> to head of PlayStation Worldwide Studios in November 2019, succeeding Shuhei Yoshida (who, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> last week, will be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment early next year).</p>
<p>Earlier this year<span>, following Jim Ryan's departure, Hulst&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> another promotion and became the new co-CEO of the entire PlayStation business alongside Hideaki Nishino</span>. Hulst is handling the Studio Business Group and is, therefore, closer to the game development side, which makes sense given his background, while Nishino handles the Platform Business Group.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, the executive was asked one of the most important questions in most industries: what kind of impact will generative AI have? When it comes to game development, Hulst believes there will have to be a balance between maintaining the human touch and leveraging the opportunities enabled by generative AI technologies.</p>
<p><em>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content. Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</em></p>
<p>That's probably a safe approach in most cases with generative AI. So far, PlayStation hasn't announced any specific initiative to implement gen AI into its own games, but that doesn't mean they are not researching it. Microsoft's Xbox, on the other hand, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered</a> with leading startup Inworld AI to create Narrative Graph, a tool that game developers can use to generate a branching graph of the narrative alongside character profiles and their knowledge. It may be a while before we see actual triple-A games shipping with the technology, though.</p>
<p>The PlayStation CEO of Studio Business Group also talked about the ongoing goal of bringing game franchises to the big and small screen through <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-productions-founded-to-adapt-sonys-videogame-ips-for-cinema-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Productions</a> and its partners. Hulst said:</p>
<p><em>I am hoping to raise the PlayStation IP outside of just the gaming category and elevate it so it sits comfortably within the larger entertainment industry.</em></p>
<p>So far, Sony has released two feature films (Uncharted and Gran Turismo) and two TV series (The Last of Us and Twisted Metal), with many more on the way, such as Until Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone, Gravity Rush, God of War, and of course the sequels to Uncharted and The Last of Us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s5teaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Embark Studios announced</a> that Season 5 of THE FINALS will be launching on December 12. In this season, there will be a new map, gadgets, weapons, social clubs and sponsors to help spice up the game. This season takes players to the mountainside town of Bernal, which is home to one of the biggest monoliths in the world. This arena features historic cobblestone streets with a vibrant and colorful colonial plaza as the centerpiece of the map. Players will be able to leap across rooftops to find secrets in the nooks and crannies of the map while fighting for survival against their opponents. There are destructible environments to add to the spectacle of the fight, allowing you to strip away Bernal's historic charm and instead turn it into a bullet-ridden ruin.</p>
<p>Embark Studios has released a new trailer for the upcoming season, so that you can see what you can expect from the new season in THE FINALS on December 12.</p>
<p><iframe title="THE FINALS | Season 5 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9TekVsp_UE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This season also adds a new way for players to connect with each other. The feature is called Clubs, and is a social system that is inspired by real sports teams. Regardless of whether you're playing solo or you're in a squad, Clubs allow new ways for players to connect with each other, collaborate, or compete. By utilizing Clubs, Contestants can work together to complete challenges as a team using Club Contracts. This will allow you to earn XP and fans, or you can use Team-Up Requests to find teammates for your preferred game mode.</p>
<p>That's not all that players can expect to see in THE FINALS Season 5, as there are some new weapons, including the ShAK-12 and Cerberus 12GA, weapons for the Heavy and Medium classes respectively. Along with weapons being added, there are some new Gadgets, including the Gravity Vortex and Lockbolt Launcher, for the Light and Heavy classes, respectively.</p>
<p>Fan favorite sponsor ISEUL-T returns to Season 5 of THE FINALS, and two brand-new sponsors, DISSUN and VAIYA, join the roster of sponsors. This season, THE FINALS launches on PlayStation 4 for the first time, allowing a whole new audience to experience the game that weren't able to previously. Of course, while there are new items and features being added, Embark Studios has also worked on balancing the game and weapons as needed while adding quality-of-life improvements. Players can now expect support for a 120Hz mode on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series</a> X, allowing those on the console to experience the new season of THE FINALS in a smoother performance.</p>
