			<p>With each passing month, artificial intelligence creeps into more industries. That does not exclude the gaming industry, which has long used artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, the generative AI that is taking root everywhere offers much more power, and also much greater risk, compared to what gaming developers were used to. Big companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> are already laying off (or thinking about laying off) employees to invest further into artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>What do the actual developers think about this artificial intelligence revolution? Their takes, as you would expect, are quite varied. The creator of Super Smash Bros., Masahiro Sakurai, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks generative AI can help make large-scale development manageable</a>. Hideo Kojima, the man behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding franchises, wants to use the technology to deal with more basic tasks while he can concentrate on the creative parts of game development and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to 'stay ahead'</a>.</p>



<p>Richard Pillosu, co-founder of Spanish indie developer Epictellers Entertainment, shared a similar, albeit more clear-cut opinion <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Wccftech</a>, stating that there is no point in using AI in any creative endeavor. </p>



<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent chat with DayZ creator Dean Hall</a> about his studio's survival game ICARUS, I once again inquired about the stance that Hall and the RocketWerkz team have adopted regarding artificial intelligence. The game designer likened the widespread fears surrounding AI to adults 'losing their mind' when Google's search engine and Wikipedia emerged between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Then, he added that artificial intelligence is here to stay regardless of what people do. At RocketWerkz, they haven't found a need to use it with ICARUS, although Hall said they are using AI as a coding support tool for other projects. The designer reckons there's still some way to go before a more active use case makes sense, but did not seem averse to the idea. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. </em></p>



<p><em>We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</em></p>



<p>While actual game developers share their thoughts about AI usage in the industry, Elon Musk has thrown the gauntlet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xai-will-release-great-full-scale-ai-generated-game-late-2026-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the xAI division would release a full-scale AI-generated game before the end of next year. It's a highly ambitious goal, but then again, the technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate.</p>

			<p>Pathea Games, the studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a>, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/my-time-at-evershine-is-first-confirmed-game-for-nintendo-switch-2/">My Time at Evershine</a> has just shadow-dropped something you'd be more likely to expect from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Velan Studios after its game Knockout City</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-bans-bots/">Psyonix</a> as a spin-off from Rocket League with Superball, a new free-to-play 3v3 arcade hero football game that's out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced during the ID@Xbox and IGN Showcase, Superball is described as a mash between Rocket League, something that's made extremely obvious with its giant ball and arena style, and Overwatch with its hero character elements.</p>



<p>You play as one of 17 characters that each slot into one of three categories: goalkeepers, midfielders, and forwards. Goalkeepers are your slower, bulky characters that can protect their net with shield abilities while also sporting a massive long-distance shot.</p>



<p>Midfielders are your agile two-way players who can help out on offense and defense, and finally forwards are your offensive-focused powerhouses built to score goals and not much else.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>After years of iteration, sleepless nights and many Chongqing hot summers, our team at Pathea is thrilled to finally bring Superball to players</em>," said lead producer Guo Yuheng in a press release. "<em>We're incredibly grateful to our community for their patience and for sticking with us on this journey. What started as a PvP mech combat game evolved into something much bigger and polished, when a football-inspired side mode captured the team's imagination. We can't wait to see everyone jump into the arenas, unleash their favorite heroes, and help shape the future of Superball together with us</em>."</p>



<p>Superball began its life as 'Super Buckyball Tournament,' and has been in the works since 2019 under that name before becoming 'Superball' in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059110/view/4264427597941058609">July 2024</a>. After multiple delays along the way and player beta and alpha tests in the meantime, it's finally here for players on PC and Xbox Series to dive into. There's no word yet as to whether it'll come to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, but that's likely always a possibility at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside its standard 3v3 mode, players will also be able to check out four extra modes called Slam Dunk, Dodgeball, Icebreaker, and Divine Path. As it's a free-to-play live service game, it's also launching with a Season 1 battle pass, but a bit of a wrinkle in the game's F2P structure is that you'll only get 72 hours from when you sign up with the majority of the game's heroes.</p>



<p>After that, you have to unlock the rest of the characters by grinding for them, after using your single voucher to unlock whichever character you preferred in your 72-hour window to try them all out.</p>



<p>Superball is also available on Xbox Game Pass, though considering it's a free-to-play game, that's a fairly moot point. </p>
