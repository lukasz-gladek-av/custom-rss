			<p>South Korean publisher WEMADE MAX and developer MADNGINE have unveiled a new open world action RPG called Project TAL with a stunning trailer. </p>



<p>In this single player game, which is currently scheduled to arrive on PC and consoles in 2027, players will explore a reimagining of Korea's traditional Tal masks and the mythology and folklore surrounding them. Project TAL features cinematic and fast-paced combat where players can leap onto massive monsters to deliver powerful attacks, exploit enemy weak spots, and perform tactical counterattacks and skill combos.</p>



<p>One of the game's core features is a companion system that responds dynamically to the player’s combat style and the environment. Each NPC companion featured in the game has unique abilities, personalities and combat roles ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged and magic. Players will experience seamless moments of cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion in the heat of battle or witnessing a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks away from the party.</p>



<p>Sohn Myun-seok, CEO of WEMADE MAX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Project TAL combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG. With MADNGINE’s technical expertise and artistic vision, we’re creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage.</em></p>

<p>WEMADE MAX and MADNGINE previously worked together on the MMORPG Night Crows, which launched in Korea in 2023 and globally last year. However, Project TAL is a far cry from it, being a single player action-oriented roleplaying game for PC and consoles, whereas Night Crows is an MMORPG for PC and mobile with blockchain-powered play-to-earn features.</p>



<p>According to the press release, MADNGINE has recently established a 'multi-production creative structure' to develop multiple new franchises, such as Project TAL. Going forward, it will focus on high-end genres, platform diversity and technological scalability.</p>
