			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update started rolling out today, bringing improvements to the system software performance and more.</p>
<p>As confirmed earlier today, the system software update 25.01-10.60.00 started rolling out today in a phased release. According to the update notes, this is a minor system software update, as it brings the usual system software performance and stability improvements as well as improved messages and usability on some screens. Besides these changes, the new system software update doesn't seem to introduce anything else.</p>
<p>It has been some time since the release of the latest PlayStation 5 major system software update. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24.06 update</a> launched last September introduced the Welcome hub, personalized 3D audio profiles, Remote Play improvements, and more. Of these, the Welcome hub was definitely the most important new feature, as it introduced a space on the console's home screen that can be customized using different widgets that display, for example, the battery level for connected accessories, the console's current storage status, and more. The update also introduced some under-the-hood changes that impacted several games, like Final Fantasy XVI which required <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/">another update to fix.</a></p>
<p>Additional information on the latest PlayStation 5 system software update can be found on the console's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/it-it/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">official website.</a></p>

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 patch is now live, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 4 support to the game which brings, with its Transformer model, significant image quality improvements over DLSS 3.8.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/538843836072329454?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2.21 patch</a>, which went live earlier today, introduces, among different things, new Photo Mode features, vehicle color customization fixes, randomizer settings in Character Creation, and a slew of other general fixes. The biggest addition, however, is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi Frame Generation</a> for the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. Following the patch, it is possible to choose between the old CNN model or the Transformer model for DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Ray Reconstruction on all RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>As highlighted by NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">earlier this month</a>, the new NVIDIA DLSS 4 Transformer model does bring significant image quality improvements, as highlighted in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>. In Cyberpunk 2077, the new model comes with a small performance cost, but image quality benefits greatly from it, as ghosting is considerably reduced, and the image looks more detailed than before in motion. Anti-aliasing for distant objects is improved as well.</p>
