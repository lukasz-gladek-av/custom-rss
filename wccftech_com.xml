			<p>It didn't take long for <strong>Amazon</strong> to decide when <strong>New World</strong> would be taken offline. As you might remember, the gaming division of the giant corporation <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that no more content would be made for the game</a></strong> just three months ago, while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">quietly </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceling the in-development The Lord of the Rings MMO project</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that New World had been delisted from stores, making it unavailable for new purchases, and clarified the date the servers will go offline forever: <strong>January 31, 2027</strong>.</p>



<p>While that's over a year away, having a definitive shutdown date is a particularly sad occurrence for any MMO. Unlike regular games, MMOs are actual virtual worlds inhabited by thousands of players on each server, creating permanent communities and social structures such as guilds. For some players, losing access is a bit like losing connection to places and people you've come to appreciate. That's why communities often fight to keep them alive one way or another. </p>



<p>That sentiment is indeed very strong for New World, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was doing better with the latest updates released by the developers</a> and was actually trending upward in player counts - just not as much as Amazon desired. The game's community has discussed ways to keep the game alive; there's precedent for it, chiefly with <strong>City of Heroes</strong>, the superhero-themed MMORPG created by <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> and later acquired by <strong>NCSoft</strong>. When NCSoft shut down the game in 2012, fans spun up a private server, and the server code leak in <strong>April 2019</strong> led to multiple private servers. One in particular, called <strong>Homecoming</strong>, eventually emerged above all others, and NCSoft granted Homecoming an official license to host the game in 2024.</p>



<p>That was about the best outcome New World fans could hope for. However, in a veritable twist, <strong>Alistair McFarlane</strong>, COO and Company Director at <strong>Facepunch</strong> (the British developer behind <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Garry's Mod</strong>), <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> a <strong>$25 million 'offer'</strong> to purchase the game from Amazon, adding that 'games should never die'. </p>



<p>Needless to say, having an actual professional game studio pick up the game would be far better. Amazon also demonstrated they are not actually averse to the idea; as part of their mass gaming layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they sold the upcoming MOBA, <strong>March of Giants</strong>, to <strong>Ubisoft</strong></a>. The difference is that in that case, they sold the game alongside the development team based in Montréal, Canada, whereas most of the New World team is likely already gone. </p>



<p>This would make it hard for a game like New World to sustain itself over time. Unlike sandbox games like Rust or Garry's Mod, the MMO is mostly themepark-based, meaning it sustains itself on developer-made content rather than user-generated content. Even if it acquired the license, Facepunch <strong>would still have to build a small team to keep it going and add new content every once in a while</strong>.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Facepunch to ask whether McFarlane's offer was genuine in the first place and will update this story if and when they respond.</p>

			<p>Nintendo used to be one of the <strong>most secretive game companies around</strong>, and one of those that took the hardest stance against leakers, giving rise to the long-lasting joke that the <strong>company sends its household ninja warriors </strong>to take care of them. </p>



<p>Over the past few years, however, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a lot of information </strong><span><strong>about the company's systems and games has leaked online</strong>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;</span>official announcements, such as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which had been an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">open secret</a></strong> long before its<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/"> official reveal</a></strong> and release last year.</p>



<p>With so many leaks, one may think the Japanese company addressed the issue and <strong>tightened the lid</strong> on its future releases before their announcements, but this doesn't seem to be the case, as <strong>a possible new Nintendo Switch 2 model</strong> may have leaked online, and via one of the company's official websites, no less.</p>



<p>Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dootsky.re"><strong>@dootsky.re</strong></a> confirmed to have discovered <strong>something interesting</strong>. <em>"On Nintendo's Account Portal, there's an unused model code under the name "OSM". (The Switch 2's model code is BEE.)"</em></p>



<p>In addition, the portal has images for every Switch model, and <strong>requesting OSM returns the image of a Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which is confirmed not to be a random placeholder, as trying to get an image for any other combination of strings on the company's web service to generate icons returns an error message.</p>







<p>As the Bluesky user highlighted, <strong>the image for the Nintendo Switch 2 "OSM" model is the same used for the current system</strong>, so it shouldn't be used to speculate about which product OSM will be.</p>



<p>However, it's hard not to think about <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong>, especially in light of what president Shuntaro Furukawa said earlier this month regarding the company's desire to make the system more accessible to people<em> "who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age." </em></p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">current RAM shortages and price spikes</strong> <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">set </span>to&nbsp;affect many<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">tech products,</a></strong> however, it remains to be seen <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much cheaper a Lite model would be</strong>, given that the current Nintendo Switch 2 model's price could increase if the situation doesn't normalize anytime soon.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">'Nintendo has been very "leaky" over the last two years. Maybe they need a plumber?'</em> commented gamerweeb1 on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/potential-new-switch-2-model-osm-discovered-on-nintendos-internal-website.1407796/post-150113233"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums</strong></a>, echoing a common community sentiment with a joke. <span>Hopefully, this leak will amount to something interesting, as most of the company's leaks have in the past few years, or will, at least, make a certain plumber materialize,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-odyssey-unmissable-adventure/" target="_blank"><strong>who has been absent with his 3D adventures for quite a long time.</strong></a></span></p>
