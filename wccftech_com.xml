			<p>With series developer Team NINJA starting to focus on action RPG games with a distinct Soulslike feel with the first entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/">Nioh</a> series, it felt like the Japanese studio was done with the Ninja Gaiden franchise, one of the series that better defines the team. As the years went by with no news on a new entry in the series, it felt more and more like Ryu Hayabusa's story had come to an end, but in early 2025, it was made clear how the series is not only alive, but also rather well. Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> and the classic 2D action game Ninja Gaiden Ragebound earlier this year, the series will return to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S with Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that has the potential of being not only one of the best entries in the series, but one of the best action games of the generation, combining the best Team NINJA and PlatinumGames have offered with their games to date.</p>



<p>Though very short, barely clocking 30 minutes in length, the Ninja Gaiden 4 Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game will continue the series tradition of lightning-fast action gameplay, but with a distinct PlatinumGames flavor. Controlling Yakumo in a futuristic rendition of Tokyo which ran extremely well on Xbox Series X, with little to none framerate drops, I was able to try out his parkour and movement abilities, which include a grappling hook for superior mobility across long distances that also has some combat applications, fight a few regular enemies along the way, which were combo'ed to death using different weapons, aerial launchers and devastating finishing moves, and put my skills to the test against a powerful boss. This fight was definitely the highlight of the experience, as it served as an introduction to Yakumo's Bloodraven form, a special technique that allows the Raven clan ninja to enhance his weapons and expand their movesets using blood.</p>

<p>Mastering a complex combat system with the limited time available was a challenge, and it took me many attempts to understand how to use the Bloodraven technique to prevent the powerful boss from unleashing his special attacks and stagger him so that he could be damaged with longer combos, which are performed in typical PlatinumGames fashion by using light and heavy attacks in specific sequences. What I appreciated the most is that, compared to too many character-action games, Ninja Gaiden 4 doesn't toss everything the player learns out of the window in boss fights, but actually allows players to use any intricate combo they use against regular enemies even against certain bosses. It's impossible to know if this will be the case for all of them, but the fact that this was possible against this particular boss definitely bodes well. With the rocking music's intensity ramping up as the boss entered his second phase, with more powerful attacks which were trickier to dodge, and some clearly advanced tech that required more time to be used properly, including the dodge offset mechanic made popular by the Bayonetta series, the game immediately brought to mind Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, one of PlatinumGames' finest action games ever.</p>



<p>Unable to try out Ryu Hayabusa's gameplay, which should be closer in feel to the traditional series' experience, it's impossible to say at this time how Ninja Gaiden 4 will balance the new and old approach and how everything will come up together, but the little taste of the experience I had made more more excited than before about the game, which has the serious chance of topping <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> as my game of the year. Thankfully, the wait won't be too long, as the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 21.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date/">announced</a> that Skate will launch into early access this coming September 16, 2025, on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today, EA and Full Circle debuted a new development update which delved into what players will be able to experience at launch, and the early access roadmap for Skate, and spoiler alert, there's no defined date yet for its 1.0 launch. </p>



<p>What the roadmap does have is the breakdown of how Skate will be getting its major updates, which will be distinguished by seasons. The first season will arrive sometime in October 2025, with the introduction of Skate's battle pass that's just called the Skate Pass, two seasonal events including a Halloween event, and of course a slew of bug fixes. </p>



<p>Every season Full Circle releases will include "<em>new skateable areas, new challenges, new seasonal events, new brand partners, new cosmetics, new tracks added to the soundtrack, bug fixes, and quality of life updates</em>."</p>

<p>Season 2 will arrive sometime in December, which will introduce co-op gameplay, improvements to the video editor, and new tricks to perform on top of the regular seasonal updates, and Season 3 will add new game modes, leaderboards, more ways to customize your skater, player-created parks, and more tricks for players to master when it arrives in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding what'll be there at launch in the time between September 16 and the season one release, players will more or less get the chance to get comfortable with Skate again, especially if you've not been part of the closed playtesting period.</p>



<p>The flick-it-style gameplay that made Skate iconic has been rebuilt within EA's Frostbite engine, and there's a Skatepedia players can lean on to help them master every trick in the book, or at least every trick that'll be included in the game at launch.</p>



<p>If you were in the insider playtesting for Skate, then you're already playing the early access version of the game, as EA and Full Circle have already pushed it to playtesters. Everyone else will be able to jump in for free on September 16.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2025-psychonauts-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psychonauts-2-headlines-the-september-2025-ps-plus-essential-batch-of-games.1282167/</guid>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus Essential and all PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to add to their libraries for September 2025, with historic developer Double Fine's Psychonauts 2 headlining after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-august-2025-lies-of-p-dayz-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">Lies of P</a> was the headliner for August 2025. </p>



<p>Alongside Psychonauts 2, beginning on September 2, players will be able to add puzzle game Viewfinder to their libraries, and the classic, and perhaps most iconic, cozy farming game ever, Stardew Valley. If you've still not added the August 2025 games to your library, September 1, 2025 will be your last chance to do so.</p>

<p>Psychonauts 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2005 platforming brain-hopping adventure from Double Fine, and despite not being the most recent release of these three games, is arguably the most significant.</p>



<p>That's not to discredit Stardew Valley, only to say that Stardew has been around for so long, been on sale so often, and has been available in so many ways that its inclusion here feels more like a 'nice to have' than a must-grab for PlayStation fans. That said, if you've somehow never played Stardew Valley, then this is a chance you should not miss. It's one of the most successful indie games ever, and for good reason.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/">reviewed Psychonauts 2 at launch back in 2021</a>, we called it "<em>absolutely mindblowing,</em>" and said that it "<em>delivers on everything it madly promises</em>." </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/">MobileGamer.biz</a> reported on how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass 9,000+ layoffs</a> across the company impacted King, the mobile division acquired alongside Activision Blizzard and the home of Candy Crush, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">developers being replaced by the AI tools they were forced to build.</a> Now, MobileGamer.biz has followed up with a <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use/">new report</a> that digs further into the chaos caused by the 200 developers being cut from King, with toxic leadership making decisions that don't align with the reasons given for them, and how Microsoft has been making daily AI use for King staff mandatory.</p>



<p>To say that things are not great within King seems to be an understatement. Layoffs are never good for morale, and layoffs that try to replace human workers with AI tools they were building seem to have the potential to hit new lows. </p>



<p>The mandated AI use from Microsoft certainly hasn't helped morale, but one source didn't lay the blame entirely at daily AI use and Microsoft's feet. The fault, as is usually the case, lies with poor leaders, in their eyes. "<em>Microsoft and AI is one cause [of the low morale] but the toxicity is endemic of the leadership team at King.</em>"</p>



<p>That's exasperated when leadership has been making decisions that employees cannot make heads or tails of, for the simple fact that they don't line up compared to the reasoning leadership is trying to pass off to employees.</p>



<p>"<em>It didn’t matter that it was people who worked there for ten or more years or who contributed to the success and earned promotions</em>. <em>Performance didn’t matter</em>," said one source. King has a rubric for its employee performance reviews, but according to a senior manager, nothing about the regular protocols for letting staff go seemed to factor in.</p>



<p>"<em>The logic for who has been chosen to be laid off has been hard to figure honestly…the rationale outlined was our heavy management layer and inefficient product development, but looking at the people let go, it doesn’t align</em>," they said. The reasoning behind the cuts seems even more skewed when other sources claimed several of those cut staff were rehired shortly after.</p>



<p>What's also troubling is the speculation the sources provide as to some of the actual reasons behind the cuts to help fit Microsoft's narrative of a "<em>heavy management layer</em>" and inefficiencies. One source speculates that certain staff were recently promoted to middle-management roles specifically so they could be cut in July. Another speculates that the cuts looked like executives "<em>listed every employee, sorted by salary and then fired them top down, only skipping over people they trust."</em></p>



<p>More on the allegations of a toxic environment and toxic management, one source claims that a key reason for those issues stems from the fact that employees can no longer deliver anonymous feedback. </p>



<p>"<em>Every question or piece of feedback was always connected to a name, which scared a lot of people, rightfully so. As a manager I was always trying to deliver that feedback to the leadership team anonymously, but I was pressed on names</em>," said one source.</p>



<p>Another source was more direct with their thoughts about the current state of the human resources department at King and how internal issues have been left to fester. "<em>HR is indeed a shitshow of incompetent people protecting the status quo of incompetent leaders</em>. <em>Often, they have protected toxic leaders that have been reported to several degrees of accountable people, HR and above.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source added, "<em>HR has often protected toxic leaders and put pressure on the ‘difficult’ employees for reporting the issue</em>. <em>Employees that were vocal and known for being vocal have been targeted by HR on several occasions.</em>"</p>



<p>On top of all this, mandated daily AI use hangs over every employee's head. "<em>AI was being introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago</em>," said a source. "<em>The goal for last year, if I recall correctly, was having a 70 or 80% daily usage of AI on general tasks. And the goal for this year was to get up to 100%, so that every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it on a daily basis.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source said they believe there are more cuts to come beyond the 200 from last month. </p>



<p>What's happening at King, and what's happening across Microsoft and the rest of the videogame industry with what has felt like a constant onslaught of mass layoffs for the last few years, will have drastic repercussions on the industry that will be felt for years to come. To say it's unfortunate is an understatement, and to say that it's tragic only beings to address the scope of the issue.</p>
