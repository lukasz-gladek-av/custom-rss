			<p>After surprising everyone with its better-than-expected remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Bloober Team's next project, a brand-new game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, looks like it's the next survival horror game players should keep their eyes on.</p>
<p>Bloober Team showcased our first honest look at gameplay from Cronos: The New Dawn in a new gameplay trailer, where fans of survival horror titles will see some similarities to popular games in the genre like Dead Space, but that's not to say Cronos: The New Dawn isn't doing anything new.</p>
<p>Like merging, for example. Enemies in Cronos: The New Dawn can 'merge,' meaning your job isn't done once you've shot an enemy dead. You need to burn the body. Otherwise, another enemy will take that dead bit of flesh on the ground and merge with it to make itself even stronger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you're facing a bigger, badder enemy than you were before. If you keep letting enemies merge with the ones you thought you already took out, you can quickly find yourself in an even more terrifying situation. It's an additional layer of combat that means you'll always have to be on your toes between managing the enemies walking towards you and those you've already put down.</p>

<p>In a press release, co-director and producer on Cronos: The New Dawn, Jacek Zięba, writes, "<em>Imagine this: a distorted mix of sci-fi, time travel, retro-futuristic dread, and body horror—all set against the gritty backdrop of&nbsp; 80s Poland. What a ride, right? And whatever you do… don't let them merge.</em>"</p>
<p>Co-director and designer Wojciech Piejko adds, "<em>How do you fight them? Fire! Burn the </em><br>
<em>fallen before they merge with living creatures. The merge changes the game, adding a </em><br>
<em>whole new layer of strategy to combat. Push your survival instincts to the max.</em>"</p>
<p>When we get our hands on Cronos, it'll be interesting to see how merging impacts combat, and what else the game has in store for survival horror fans. After all, Bloober Team has declared that it won't be making "<em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/">shitty</a></em>" games anymore.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have an official release date yet, but we know it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. This means it'll be the studio's first new title to test that declaration.</p>

			<p>In today's new The Outer Worlds 2 video published as part of April's IGN First, Obsidian Entertainment revealed that the RPG sequel will feature 'way more expansive worlds' than the original (which is great news, as that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of my pet peeves with The Outer Worlds</a>). In classic Obsidian fashion, they will also be filled with fun stories and cool gear or collectibles to find.</p>
<p>Art Director Daniel Alpert explained:</p>
<p><em>We're definitely going more expansive than the first game. In the first game, we were very confined to smaller hubs and overland areas. Now that we're utilizing Unreal Engine 5, we can have way more expansive worlds. From point A to point B, there is a much larger territory that we can cover, and in between those areas, we have lots of little POIs (points of interest) that we can explore.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Brandon Adler added:</p>
<p><em>One of the very first things that we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, large, expansive areas. It's what players told us that they wanted the most. Working with Daniel and the other directors, we sat down and came up with a plan to how we were going to go do that. We made sure that we had big open sightlines and that we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool-looking points of interest at a distance to really draw people and also maybe bring them off the beaten path a little bit. When they're heading over there, we made sure that as you're rounding corners or you're doing things like that, you see little points of interest. Another element that was also really important as we're kind of doing all of this stuff is making sure that it was very interesting when you get there, so we made sure that we blanketed all of our areas with just cool, fun stuff to go do, nice loot to go find, and cool stories to go unfold.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, IGN also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview that dived into the changes and improvements made to the underlying RPG formula of The Outer Worlds 2. The developers are trying to avoid a situation where by the end of the game, the main character is essentially good at everything. They're also removing respec to make sure that choices truly matter.</p>
<p>Lead systems designer Kyle Koenig said:</p>
<p><em>We would often see characters good at everything, which by the end of the game, minimized your personal experience with your character. We wanted to focus on making each individual level-up and investment really important. There's less confusion on when I should invest in one Skill or the other. If I want to be a player that's all about guns and using medical devices, I know which Skills I really need to care about. By having them separated and not in groupings, it lets characters be more specialized.&nbsp;By removing respec, we really incentivize it to be your experience. It is a part of your experience that no one else had, and I think that's really special about RPGs and something that respec tends to lessen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will also feature a full-fledged stealth system, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> last week. More info should be coming throughout April, though the big showcase is scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>A new Indiana Jones and The Great Circle video shared online today compares all console versions, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version is closer to the PlayStation 5 Pro version than the base model release.</p>
<p>The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> takes a good look at the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game, showing an early game sequence running on all systems while keeping track of the performance, which is rock solid on all three systems in terms of frame time and frames per second, and the render resolution. While the PlayStation 5 Pro version obviously runs at the highest resolution, native 4K most of the time, the Xbox Series X doesn't lag too far behind, having a smaller gap with the PlayStation 5 Pro version than with the base PlayStation 5 version, which is made more impressive by the console's power usage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Xbox Series X vs PS5 vs PS5 Pro - FPS and Resolution Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itCYV8m04Fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There was no doubt that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle would run best on PlayStation 5 Pro, considering it is the most powerful console available on the market. Besides running at native 4K resolution most of the time, this version of the game comes with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancements</a> over the other systems, which include light global illumination, ambient occlusion, and contact shadows improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro for owners of the Premium Edition, and will release for everyone else later today.</p>
