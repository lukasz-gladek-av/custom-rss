			<p>During today's letter from the Producer LIVE broadcast, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-major-patch-for-ffxiv-dawntrail-set-for-mid-november-release/">patch 7.1</a>, named "Crossroads," will be released on November 12. Along with the release date announcement for FFXIV: Dawntrail's first major update, a new trailer was released to showcase some of the content that would be coming with the update, including the highly anticipated crossover raid with Final Fantasy 11. If you are playing FFXIV: Dawntrail and want to see what you can expect in the upcoming patch, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Patch 7.1 - Crossroads" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb08eqW1QQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is a little over three minutes long and showcases the "Echoes of Vana'diel" crossover Alliance raid with Final Fantasy XI, Square Enix's first MMORPG. The first raid in the series will be called "Jeuno: The First Walk," which will be implemented into the upcoming patch, seeing both iconic worlds of FFXIV and Final Fantasy XI come together to create an iconic 24-player battle. Players will get to immerse themselves in the world of Vana'diel in this first part of the Alliance Raid, with additional wings of the raid to follow in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) also showcased the upcoming Ultimate difficulty 8-player raid, which will be in patch 7.11. This is quite a way off yet, but it gets players excited about the upcoming content that will be added in future patches. Additionally, players got a look at the first Chaotic difficulty 24-player battle content, which will be arriving one week after patch 7.15.</p>
<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of what's to come in patch 7.1 of FFXIV: Dawntrail, there is something for everyone to dive into. As with most new major patches, players will be able to continue the Main Scenario Quests (MSQ).</p>
<p>For those who prefer group content and like to try and get new gear, there will be a new dungeon named Yuweyawata Field Station to delve into. As mentioned above, there is also the Echoes of Vana'diel - Jeuno: The First Walk 24-player Alliance Raid. In addition, there is also a new trial named The Minstrel's Ballad: Sphene's Burden.</p>
<p>The new content added will be at the baseline difficulty level to allow players time to get used to the mechanics without having to worry about an increase in difficulty. However, for those who prefer a challenge, there is also the new Unreal Trial, which will see you face off against Byakko in The Jade Stoa trial at level 100.</p>
<p>There will also be a new Ultimate Raid for those who like to work in a bigger group of people to take down objectives, and this will take players into the Futures Rewritten Ultimate Raid. This is just the tip of the iceberg of content that is available, as there will also be other sidequests and quests for characters such as Hildibrand, as well as new player housing updates for those who like to have a customized area to stay in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro features a major repairability improvement that is usually not found in video game consoles.</p>
<p>Judging from a <a href="https://imgur.com/FvyBYhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picture</a> of the system that's been making the rounds, the soon-to-be-released console features a slot that grants quick access to the CMOS battery. This battery is an extremely important component of gaming systems, as it powers the CMOS chip that stores important hardware information and may prevent a system from functioning properly, as was the case for the PlayStation 4 before Sony issued an update to fix the issues related to a bad or missing CMOS battery.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn more about the PlayStation 5 Pro, as the system launches next week worldwide and has already reached stores. Earlier this week, the console also got into the hands of the press and influencers, and, not being able to talk about the system just yet, some of them got rather creative and decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-review-box/">review the box</a>, which is a markedly "PlayStation" box. Developers are also ready for the system's release, launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-playstation-5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patches</a> to allow their games to take advantage of the console's increased power and features, such as PSSR.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>The PC version of GTA Online will be updated sometime next year with features introduced in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_community-update-20241101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> shared online today outlining what's coming to the game in the next few weeks, Rockstar Games confirmed there are plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X features of the game to the PC version next year. These features include ray tracing support, texture and draw distance upgrades, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, enhanced anti-aliasing and motion blur, improved explosions and fire, and more.</p>
<p>With GTA VI coming next year, it will be very interesting to see how Rockstar Games will handle GTA Online. Still, for the time being, it seems like updates and new content won't stop coming anytime soon, with more coming this December and beyond. The game's continued support is hardly surprising, considering it's still extremely popular, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/">last month</a>, over 400,000 players logged into the game to play the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival Mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>
