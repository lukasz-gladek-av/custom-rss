			<p>It looks like the secret is finally out of the bag: <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>'s "new" IP, previously rumored to be sci-fi-themed, is actually an expansion of the existing <strong>God of War</strong> universe with a new franchise.</p>



<p>The confirmation came from a LinkedIn profile (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on the ResetEra board</a>) of a Senior Writer who worked remotely at <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> between August 2020 and September 2025, writing on their resume:</p>



<p><em>Helped shape narrative vision and creative direction at Sony Santa Monica Studio for a new franchise within the God of War universe, developing characters, storylines, and original lore that expanded the acclaimed IP. Integrated story with gameplay and worldbuilding through scripts and narrative content, collaborating across disciplines to deliver emotionally driven experiences for a global audience. Contributed to long-term narrative and franchise strategy.</em></p>



<p>This also fits with Jason Schreier's claims. He previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Cory Barlog's game <strong>wasn't really based on </strong><span><strong>new intellectual property</strong>, but&nbsp;</span>would feel like one. Furthermore, in his latest report about <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bluepoint Games</strong> shutting down</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-last-year-fromsoftware-shut-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>FromSoftware</strong> denied a <strong>Bloodborne</strong> remake pitch</a>, Schreier mentioned how Sony was looking to expand God of War with "<strong>several sequels and spinoffs, like its own smaller version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong>". One of them was supposed to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled live service game in development at Bluepoint</a>, but it's clear that Sony Santa Monica was also working on its own "spin-off".</p>



<p>As for what it could be, <strong>there have been rumors about God of War dealing with Egyptian mythology</strong> for a long time. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>Kratos would wield the Khopesh in the next game</strong>. Last week, dataminers <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-egyptian-setting-datamined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> <strong>a hidden cutscene in the files of God of War Ragnarok</strong>, heavily hinting at Egypt being the setting of the next installment.</p>



<p>However, if this is truly a new franchise within the larger God of War fictional setting, there could be new main characters. <strong>It's far from a given that Kratos and Atreus will once again be the leads</strong>. Still, we won't have to wait too long: Kratos' voice actor <strong>Christopher Judge</strong> recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-new-combat-system-cory-barlog-game-late-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that <strong>Sony Santa Monica's new game will be revealed around late Summer</strong>.</p>
