			<p>The software Lossless Scaling has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/527583114757669394?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major update from developer THS. The Frame Generation component that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> exactly one year ago has been upgraded to version 3.0 (beta), introducing what the developer has described as major improvements across the board in quality, latency, and performance.</p>
<p>Flickering and border artifacts have been reduced, benefiting motion clarity and smoothness alike. GPU load has also shrunk by a sizable 40% compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-universal-frame-generation-2-0-out-now-improves-efficiency-noticeably-reduces-artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSFG 2</a> x2 in non-Performance Mode, while multipliers above x2 have had their GPU load reduced by over 45% compared to the previous version of the software. Perhaps the most welcome enhancements are those in the latency area. According to the developer's latency test, Lossless Scaling Frame Generation 3.0 has 24% lower latency than 2.0.</p>

<p>There's more. This new release unlocks frame rate generation multipliers up to x20. However, the developer shared some recommendations to get optimal results:</p>
<p><em>Base frame rate: A minimum of 30 FPS is required (40 FPS or higher is preferred, with 60 FPS being ideal) at 1080p. </em><em>For best overall experience, locking the game frame rate is recommended. This helps to avoid 100% GPU load (reducing its impact on latency) and ensures smoother frame pacing.</em></p>
<p><em>For higher resolution, use at higher than recommended frame rates or use the "Resolution Scale" option to downscale input to 1080p:</em><br>
<em>For 1440p, set it to 75%.</em><br>
<em>For 4K, set it to 50%.</em></p>
<p><em>Higher multipliers (e.g., X5 or above) are best suited for high refresh rate setups, such as:</em></p>
<p><em>48 FPS × X5 for 240Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X6 for 360Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X8 for 480Hz.</em></p>
<p>While new and recent PC games support natively integrated frame generation (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-frame generation</a>) technologies from NVIDIA and/or AMD, older games can still benefit from this tool, especially when heavily modded.</p>

<p>THS also announced that an opt-in Lossless Scaling User Interface 3.0 beta can now be selected by going into your Steam library, right-clicking on the software, selecting properties and then beta from the Betas tab. Last but not least, Windows 11 24H2 users can once again select the DXGI Capture API thanks to Microsoft's recent KB5046617 update.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could support more than regular NVIDIA DLSS, as a recently filed patent outlines some brand-new tech that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">Digital Foundry</a> went through the 39 pages of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">patent</a> filed on December 31st, 2024, highlighting some interesting findings that go beyond the description of a standard NVIDIA DLSS-style upscaling. One of the most interesting findings is the confirmation that the upscaling method described in the patent, which is usually expensive in terms of compute power and bandwidth, is specifically targeted to be executed within the 120th or 160th of a second on a low-power chip, so it's most definitely not the usual DLSS seen in the PC desktop space.</p>
<p>Another equally interesting finding discovered in the Nintendo Switch 2 AI-upscaling patent is the description of something that could be labeled as dynamic AI-upscaling. According to this description, the model based upon real-time data coming from the game engine can be switched out in real-time or prepared ahead of time programmatically to use lower quality upscaling<br>
to fit within a certain frame time budget. Essentially, if the game is sending out an image that exceeds 16.6 milliseconds or 33.3 milliseconds, the device will use a lower-quality upscaling model to output the final 1080p image. This is obviously new tech that was never seen before in action and that may have been developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2, as something like this may not be needed in the PC desktop space unless for very low-power laptops, for example.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 patent is very broad, and describes all sorts of applications for AI-powered upscaling, such as neural decompression that could be used to bring file sizes down, and even cloud upscaling, going over various possibilities such as upscaling being done on the cloud and then sent via a stream to a local device, the upscaling getting done on the local device and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo's Switch 2 Upscaling Patent Explained: More Than Just DLSS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4R1p1LjHME8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While AI-powered upscaling can do wonders, as shown over the past few years by NVIDIA DLSS, developers still need to get their games running decently on the Nintendo Switch 2, which could be a challenge considering the system won't be as powerful as any of the other current generation systems. According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-and-speculation-ot-cmon-nintendo-announce-this-thing-already-up-dev-unit-leaked-partly-see-threadmarks.1077882/page-23#post-134076051">rumors</a> circulating online, there is a "movement" to try and get scaled-down Xbox Series S versions of games on the system, although it is not yet known if this has been successful so far, and with leaks having focused only on the hardware side of things, we will likely have to wait for the official reveal to see how multiplatform games will run on the system.</p>
<p>Speaking about leaks, Nintendo has finally acknowledged them in some way.&nbsp;<span>In a statement issued to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, the company said that the images and videos making the rounds are "not official."</span>&nbsp;What's interesting to note is that the company didn't say they are not accurate, so there's a solid chance we already got the first look at the system via all these leaks that have come in daily.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but at this point, it should only be a matter of days until we finally see what the Japanese company has in store for the future.</p>
