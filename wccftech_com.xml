			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1854993555745362400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has officially gone gold. This means the game is done, and a master copy has been sent for mass production (the game will be released on physical discs for Xbox, in addition to digital).</p>
<p>In theory, this means no more delays are in order, although there's a famous precedent: CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-officially-gold-night-city-opens-november-19th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to have gone gold on October 5, 2020, ahead of its planned November 19, 2020 launch date. However, on October 27, the Polish developer was forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a short delay to December 10. The reasons would later become obvious, as even the delay was not enough to prevent a rough launch, especially on consoles.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 fans certainly hope this won't be the case, both regarding the delay and the rough debut. After all, this game already had to suffer through a long and tough road to get here. It's been over fifteen years since the last franchise entry, 2009's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat. The first attempt at a proper STALKER 2 project was immediately started by GSC Game World, which <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game in August 2010 for a tentative 2012 release window.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian studio was dissolved in December 2011, inevitably leading to the cancellation of that project. Luckily, that wasn't the end of the story. Evgeniy Grygorovych, brother of GSC Game World's original founder Sergiy Grygorovych, successfully resurrected the studio in late 2014. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, GSC Game World returned to what it really wanted to do: make STALKER 2. The new announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in May 2018 with a targeted release window of 2021.</p>
<p>As time passed, the release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to April 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to December 2022. But the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced work on the game to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> altogether for some time. GSC Game World subsequently went silent for a long while, and fans couldn't help but wonder whether their long-awaited sequel would ever materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, a playable demo was brought to Gamescom 2023, and the developers used it to gather feedback and further improve STALKER 2. In early 2024, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delay-final-release-date-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game would launch on September 9, though we later discovered one final delay to the current date: November 20, when the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>The first character to be featured in The Witcher 4 Polaris, the highly anticipated next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red, has been revealed via an online actor's resume.</p>
<p>According to information discovered on Spotlight by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KekanKok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KekanKok</a>, British actor <a href="https://app.spotlight.com/4850-0168-8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lampert</a> will play a character called Branko in the next entry in the series. Interestingly enough, the role is dated 2025, indicating that voiceover recording and motion capture for the character will begin next year and that the game is still pretty far from release.</p>
<p>Last we heard, The Witcher 4 Polaris was still in the preproduction phase but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/">close to a major milestone</a> that would mark the end of this phase and the beginning of the actual production phase. No update on the project has been provided since August, but if the game's development proceeded as intended, it must have entered the actual production phase by now, as that was the plan earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be CD Projekt Red's first game developed using Unreal Engine 5. While this was met with skepticism from the vast majority of fans, it could actually be a great thing for the gaming industry as a whole. If there's one developer that could help Epic address the stuttering issues that continue to plague all games powered by the engine, it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be released on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
