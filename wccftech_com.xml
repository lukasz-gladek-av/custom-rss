			<p>The last Forza Horizon game, Forza Horizon 5, took drivers to Mexico, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-4-take-weather-with-you/">Forza Horizon 4</a> had them racing around the UK countryside. Playground Games and Microsoft have yet to officially say where Forza Horizon 6 will take players, but a deleted Instagram post, a new report, and Tokyo Game Show 2025 seem to have the answer.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">Forza Horizon 5</a> launched back in 2021, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-forza-horizon-5-continue-support/">despite layoffs in the last month</a>, we're closing in it being high time we heard what's next for the series. A now-deleted Instagram post from car importer Cult and Classic, featuring a Japanese Kei car being photographed for use in the next Forza Horizon game (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-setting-for-the-next-forza-horizon-game-has-seemingly-leaked-via-a-car-company/">VGC</a>), seemingly pointed to Forza Horizon 6 being set in Japan. Especially considering that Kei cars are a model of vehicle that is very rarely found outside of Japan, and is mostly manufactured in Japan.</p>



<p>Now, a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/report-forza-horizon-6-may-be-announced-this-year-in-the-same-place-the-game-is-set">Windows Central</a> adds that there are "<em>official</em>" documents being circulated that confirm the next entry in the Forza Horizon series will be announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which is due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-konami-square-enix-and-more-all-confirmed-to-attend-tokyo-game-show-2025/">take place at the end of September</a>. Insider-Gaming's <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339">Tom Henderson</a> and insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1959666173936796128">Nate the Hate</a> both corroborate that they have seen the documents in question, with Nate the Hate adding that he's not seen evidence of a Nintendo Switch 2 version as part of the equation for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can confirm that these documents have been floating around for the last week or so. There's one massively disgruntled employee at Xbox lol <a href="https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom">https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom</a></p>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If Forza Horizon 6 is indeed set in Japan, then the Tokyo Game Show makes for the perfect stage on which to unveil the next entry in the series. Even more so when you consider the presence that PlayStation has over Xbox in Japan, and the extreme likelihood, if not surefire conclusion, that the next Forza Horizon game will arrive on PlayStation, if not at launch, then perhaps shortly after, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/">thanks to the success that Forza Horizon 5 has found on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see what TGS 2025 has in store.</p>

			<p>From a gamer's perspective, there's no need for the PlayStation 6 or Xbox next-generation system, according to Final Fantasy XIV's director Naoki Yoshida.</p>



<p>Asked about the next generation of consoles and the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on them in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">Feed4Gamer</a>, Yoshi-P confirmed there's always the possibility of the game launching on new platforms, as his aim is to make the game accessible to as many players as possible. With recent platforms coming with very high specs, the team's work is considerably easier than in the past, so any new hardware release is definitely a positive in this regard. From a gamer's perspective, however, there's no need of the PlayStation 6 and the Xbox next-generation system, Yoshi-P added. Right now, the Final Fantasy XIV director feels that people are happy with the current-generation systems, highlighting how the price of new hardware likely plays a factor in this sentiment.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox, Naoki Yoshida also touched upon PlayStation 4 support for Final Fantasy XIV, which will continue for as long as possible, although there will inevitably come a time when support for the previous generation system will be dropped, mostly due to the console's OS and hardware regulations that limit data, which are already making plenty of games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">Genshin Impact</a> drop support for previous generation hardware. So far, Sony Interactive Entertainment has increased these limits for Final Fantasy XIV as per the team's requests, but they have already informed the developers that they are reaching their limits from their side, so the end of support for the PlayStation 4 version of the popular MMORPG may be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Although many may not feel the need for the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox, as Naoki Yoshida highlighted, there's no denying that the next console generation promises to be one of the most interesting in decades, as both Sony and Microsoft seem to be heading into different directions. While Microsoft seems to be going for a modular design offering<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> flexibility that will compete more with pre-built gaming PCs</a>, Sony will reportedly release a home console delivering up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">10 times the ray tracing performance of the base PlayStation 5</a> and a handheld capable of running current generation games natively.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2.5D Pixel-Art Cyberpunk Platformer Replaced Will Launch in Spring 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2-5d-pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-will-launch-in-spring-2026.1279851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Replaced, the 2.5D pixel-art, retro-futuristic, cyberpunk-themed platformer that was first announced in 2021, has a new release window from developer Sad Cat Studios, with game director Yura Zhdanovich announcing, "<em>with confidence</em>," that Replaced will arrive on PC and Xbox Series X/S in Spring 2026.</p>



<p>When Replaced was revealed in 2021, it was one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-140-third-party-studios/">enticing games coming to Xbox</a>, and players were keen to get their hands on it in 2022, when it was initially due to launch. It wasn't Zhdanovich's or the rest of Sad Cat Studios' plan to have Replaced go five years between its official announcement and release, but neither could have predicted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, and the impact it would have on the Belarus-based development team.</p>



<p>If not for the invasion, Replaced would have likely been released years ago. But the invasion, coupled with the regular complications and struggles of developing a game, pushed its launch back to 2026. In today's development update from the studio (published through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">IGN</a>), with Zhdanovich narrating, he went through a bit of the journey the game has been on, and showed how it has improved from its prototyping phase to now.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;</em><em>REPLACED&nbsp;</em>and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologise for that," Zhdanovich added in a press release. "<em>We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and&nbsp;</em><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S in Spring 2026."</p>



<p>For now, we have a release window to look forward to. Later this year, Zhdanovich confirmed that the studio will debut the final trailer for the game, at which point we'll also learn the specific release date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Next Nintendo Direct is Reportedly Set for Mid-September 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-set-for-mid-september-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two minutes past midnight on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a>, a leaker who has previously been accurate when making claims on Nintendo events, dropped a tease for a new Nintendo Direct coming next month, specifically, September 12, 2025. Following that tease, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> corroborated SwitchForce's claim by reporting that its sources have stated a Nintendo Direct is coming mid-September, though they did not take a stab at the date.</p>



<p>VGC did, however, point out that there's been a Nintendo Direct in September for nearly as long as Nintendo Directs have been around, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOooMjvltuQbJgWKKYXh3mNz-5KKgkJS8-AvxntJwYVDaiACa8RKC">save for last year</a>, and that if it is on September 12, that would put the Direct one day ahead of the Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary.</p>



<p>While we've had leaks and reports accurately predict dates for these Direct events, what's always been less accurate in that kind of early reporting is the size of the event, regarding whether it'll be a full-blown general Direct, with first and third-party news. Or, if it's just a third-party Partner Showcase, or an Indie World Direct, or a Direct focused entirely on one game.</p>



<p>The most recent Nintendo Direct presentation was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">Kirby Air Riders-dedicated showcase, </a>with Masahiro Sakurai spending 45 minutes detailing everything you'll need to know about the return of the cult-classic racer. Before that, it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, and before that, we had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/">Donkey Kong Bananza-focused Direct</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>



<p>In April, when Nintendo finally revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, was the last time we had a general Nintendo Direct. Hopefully, with three Directs focused on one specific game and a partner showcase between April and now, we're due for a bigger, general Direct that debuts what Nintendo has planned for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>Namely, the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one announcement that could appear tomorrow. The last we heard, it was due for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/"> late 2025 release</a>. There was also a playable demo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> in Germany and Fan Expo in Canada.</p>
