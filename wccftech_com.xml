			<p>Virtua Fighter is finally making its return to PC with the release of Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. For those who are excited about the return of this beloved franchise, the game is now available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam</a>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/">news comes after Sega confirmed that a new Virtua Fighter</a> game was in the works just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; This title is based on Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown and is set to provide players with an optimized gaming experience. The game will be offering support of 4K60 and is the first game in 13 years to feature balance adjustments. The upcoming title is also set to support rollback netcode, which will allow players who don't have access to a wired connection to enjoy a smoother experience on the battlefield and will allow everyone around the globe to participate in heated battles.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't too many details that are being revealed about Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., as Sega is currently keeping it all under wraps. However, it's been confirmed that a 2.0 update is planned for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown for those who are playing the game on PlayStation 4. To celebrate the announcement of Virtua Fighter coming to PC, the Opening Cinematic trailer has been released to show off some of the content that players can expect from the upcoming title. The video is just over two and a half minutes long and showcases some of the iconic fighters that will be making an appearance in the game.</p>
