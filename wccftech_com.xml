			<p>Today, Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1950194611374137730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> Update 1.0.7 for Assassin's Creed Shadows. The patch adds the highly requested New Game+ mode, allowing players to start a new playthrough after finishing Assassin's Creed Shadows the first time with all the skills, gear, Allies, and hideout progression they had already collected in their first playthrough. A New Game+ playthrough can be kicked off from the Memory Menu in the Animus after completing all of Naoe's, Yasuke's, and Junjiro's journeys.</p>



<p>Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough, players obtain Whisper of Gold and Dragon's Gold. They'll also receive a brand new gold-plated Legendary Long Katana and a Legendary Katana, each with its own unique perk engraving. With each new venture, players must face stronger foes and more demanding challenges of their Shinobi and Samurai skills.</p>



<p>This update also increases the game's level cap from 60 to 80, which means you'll be facing tougher opponents equipped with enhanced tactics and awareness. Furthermore, the Knowledge Rank system has been enhanced to levels 9 and 10, allowing players to unlock and develop a wider range of skills, passive abilities, and combat techniques.</p>



<p>It is also now possible to upgrade Naoe and Yasuke's passives and skills. Assassin's Creed Shadows players will gain one new rank for multiple nodes in their mastery skills and ten new ranks for all existing knowledge passives. The Forge can also be upgraded to level 4, enabling players to upgrade all weapons and gear to the new level cap of 80.</p>



<p>Along with new levels and ranks come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enjoy the Ride: Reach Level 80</li>



<li>Stars Unseen: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>



<li>"Worth Its Wait": Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana by completing the story on New Game+.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-plus-dlc-claws-of-awaji-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will receive its Claws of Awaji DLC on September 16</a>. </p>

			<p>I Hate This Place, a new isometric survival horror game developed by Broken Mirror Games and published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-announces-partnership-with-skybound-entertainment-developing-a-new-title-by-2025/">Skybound Games</a>, a new publishing label under Bloober Team, has just debuted its first gameplay trailer, showcasing the game's signature '80s aesthetics and the tense survival horror atmosphere it is looking to create.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for anyone who's been keeping an eye on I Hate This Place since its initial reveal <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">earlier this year</a>, no new release window is provided beyond what Skybound Games and Broken Mirror Games have already stipulated, which is that the game is due out in Q4 2025.</p>



<p>At least the gameplay trailer is a solid minute and change of gameplay, featuring a few appreciated inclusions like little 'Thud' popping up behind your feet with every step you take, as a callback to the comic series the game is based on.</p>

<p>I Hate This Place follows Elena, who is forced to survive nightmarish creatures after unknowingly summoning a power beyond what her nightmares could conjure up. When it does arrive sometime in Q4 2025, it'll be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. </p>
