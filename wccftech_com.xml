			<p>Tensions are very high among Xbox developers after the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>, which appears to have removed hundreds of jobs across the whole gaming division. The Initiative and its Perfect Dark reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">are no more</a>; ZeniMax Online's upcoming MMORPG, Project Blackbird, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceled</a>, and the studio founder left; Rare's new IP, Everwild, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">canceled</a>, and veteran Gregg Mayles also left; and Turn 10 also saw the majority of its employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">fired</a>.</p>



<p>But it does not stop there. Engadget has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html?guccounter=1">reported</a> that five employees were also cut from Halo Studios. Furthermore, the report doesn't paint a favorable picture of both Microsoft's overall plans for gaming and the progress of future Halo projects.</p>



<p>The anonymous source understandably expressed contempt for Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's internal memo, which the executive started with the reminder that Xbox is registering record numbers when it comes to users, games, and gaming hours.</p>



<p><em>I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about.</em></p>



<p>The source also said that Halo Studios is now working with contracted studios across the United States and Europe, which they didn't really like.</p>



<p><em>Xbox in general feels years behind the curve in game development, and it leads to a lot of wasted time and effort.</em></p>



<p>The kicker came when they shared the impression that Microsoft is trying to replace as many human jobs as possible with AI.</p>



<p><em>They're trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents.</em></p>



<p>It is no secret that Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, and this very possibility has been dreaded for years. Whether it's actually the case remains to be seen, but it's certainly a worrying report.</p>



<p>Lastly, the anonymous source wasn't confident that one of the Halo projects currently in the works will meet the expected standard of quality:</p>



<p><em>I don't think anybody is really happy about the quality of the product right now. There's been a lot of tension and pep talks trying to rally folks to ship.</em></p>



<p>Just two days ago, Halo Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a reveal for their next project coming at the HaloWC 2025 event, which will take place in October. Needless to say, they cannot afford another blunder after Halo Infinite, else they might find themselves in the same position as Turn 10 - or even The Initiative - after the next Microsoft review.</p>

			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by The Verge, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios was among those hit the hardest in the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive round of Microsoft layoffs</a>. </p>



<p>The sources cited by the publication suggest the 'majority' of the employees were fired. The number given was more than 70. As a result, the remaining employees would be just enough to continue supporting the latest Forza Motorsport game, which launched in October 2023 to positive critic reviews. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> at the time:</p>



<p><em>While Forza Motorsport is a good game with more than enough things going for it, there's something that just isn't that exciting. Forza Motorsport is a good game, and it's a return to form for the core Forza series - one that seriously faltered while the Horizon spinoff went from strength to strength. If, for an odd reason, you have yet to pick this up on Game Pass (or otherwise), then take this as a recommendation. Forza Motorsport is a very good racing game, a return to form for the series, and a good sign for the future of the series.</em></p>



<p>However, long-time fans did not share the same enthusiasm as critics did. The aforementioned lack of content and the RPG-like car progression system were highly criticized. While Microsoft never shared player figures, it is widely believed that the game did not meet sales expectations.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Xbox fans might be wondering where this leaves the future of such a core Xbox franchise like Forza Motorsport. Will Microsoft bring in new hires to work on a new project, and if so, how long will it take? These are just two more questions among a veritable sea of doubts and concerns sparked by the latest Xbox cuts.</p>
