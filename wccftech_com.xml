			<p>Despite dropping the mandatory PlayStation Network account sign in for single-player games on PC, looking at Lost Soul Aside, it looks like any single-player game published on PC by Playstation Publishing could still be blocked in unsupported countries.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-region-blocked-in-130-countries.1113747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1235001/info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Database </a>currently shows that the upcoming game developed by Ultizero Games will not be available for purchase in the 130 countries where the PlayStation Network is not available, despite mandatory account log-in having been dropped from the game as it was for other single player only games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-account-requirements-on-pc-dropped-for-spider-man-2-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-two-more-games/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part II Remastered and God of War Ragnarok</a>. Hopefully, this is just a leftover of the mandatory account login that has now been removed and will be rectified before launch.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside has been in development for a very long time, but its release is finally right around the corner<span>. It will launch, as confirmed during the latest PlayStation State of Play, which aired last week on<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;May 30th</a>. As mentioned above, the game originally required a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Network account sign in</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/">&nbsp;to play</a>, but now users in countries supported by the PlayStation Network won't require an account to play the game on Steam.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software beta update is now available for users invited to test it out before the public release, introducing new Activities improvements, and more.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-feb-25.1114107/">ResetERA forums</a>, the new firmware update introduces new Activity improvements that make it easier for users to view details by fully displaying them on the card itself while still keeping spoilers hidden. The update also introduces support for Unicode 16.0 emojis, some Parental Control changes, improved system software performance and stability, and enhanced message usability on some screens. So, all in all, this looks like a minor update, although more features and improvements could be added before the update goes live for all users.</p>
<p>Activities, in particular, have been receiving some attention in recent PlayStation 5 system software updates, as the latest update, update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-07-10-20-00-performance-improvements/">24.07-10.20.00</a>, made it so that each activity will display its current status. Besides improving specific features and enhancing firmware performance and stability, the latest updates have been pretty light since the latest major update, 24.06, which introduced the Welcome Hub, new Remote Play improvements, new personalized 3D audio profiles, and more. Everything that was introduced in the latest major PlayStation 5 system software update can be found in detail <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">here.</a></p>

			<p>Today, in <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetEase's Q4 earnings report</a>, we learned that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players to date across all platforms. Here's the relevant tidbit:</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals topped Steam's global top sellers chart shortly after its launch on December 6, amassing over 10 million registered users within 72 hours and over 40 million to date. Its Season 1 update in January 2025 sparked another surge, claiming the No. 1 spots on Steam's top sellers and most-played charts worldwide.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game had surpassed 20 million players just eleven days after its launch. In the first month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to have earned more than $135 million. That didn't stop NetEase from essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing the Western support team</a>, though, much to the disappointment of fans. Of course, that doesn't mean the publisher is putting less effort into supporting this highly successful game - but the workforce will be based in China, where development is obviously cheaper.</p>
<p>Anyway, Marvel Rivals will be updated tomorrow to introduce the final two members of the Fantastic Four: Human Torch and The Thing. The former is a Duelist type of character, while the latter is, predictably, a Vanguard. The update also adds a new Convergence map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. There are several gameplay and online matchmaking tweaks, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extra 0.5 seconds of grace time will be added at the end of the overtime in all modes, optimizing situations where games may end abruptly (like when players cannot be detected due to certain hero abilities or when accidentally drift slightly outside the valid range).</li>
<li>In Quick Mode, matchmaking for substitutes will no longer occur when a quick match is about to end.</li>
<li>Optimization: Improved loading speed at the start of matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side, this Marvel Rivals update adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, on PC. We've tested this as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090 review</a>, since NVIDIA provided advanced access to the feature.</p>
<p>There's good news for AMD users, too. The developers have improved frame pacing while using FSR 3 Frame Generation, so you should get a smoother experience. Additionally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-anti-lag-2-game-integrated-tech-counter-strike-2-preview-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon Anti-Lag 2</a> is available now, reducing system latency. As a reminder, Anti-Lag 2 requires an AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series or newer GPU.</p>
