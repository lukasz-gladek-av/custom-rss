			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is setting out to be one of the most visually impressive games launching this year, as the latest iteration of id Software's proprietary engine has fully embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver a complex game world at high performance.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VawgKaIfbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> shared today, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a first look at what the id Tech 8 engine delivers in the new entry in the series. While the demo that media played did not feature path tracing, it did feature regular ray tracing, which included ray-traced reflections like in DOOM Eternal and ray-traced global illumination in the vein of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,</a> which is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p>Both work extremely well. The Siege map, for example, features a lot of reflective surfaces, which wasn't entirely expected, given the change to a more naturalistic environment over past entries in the series. This change also makes ray-traced global illumination shine, delivering more accurate lighting through vast spaces lit almost entirely with natural light sources like fire and the sun. Additionally, the emphasis on dynamic objects and the removal of baked lighting makes said objects blend more seamlessly into the environment, resulting in a more pleasing visual experience.</p>
<p>Besides ray tracing features and the robust physics simulation DOOM: The Dark Ages features, the game also seems to feature a virtualized geometry system similar to Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. While this couldn't be confirmed at the time, the behavior of some visual elements, such as the absence of LOD swapping, heavily suggests this system is being used. Targeting 60 FPS with this virtualized geometry system in place together with high enemy numbers on screen, the ray-traced lighting and reflections, and the physics simulation show the amazing potential of the id Tech 8 engine. What remains to be seen is how it will actually deliver all this on consoles, but id Software has already proved in the past to have the technical chops to deliver solid experiences on all sorts of hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, just one week after Ubisoft launched its biggest game of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the company revealed it had formed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">new subsidiary with Tencent</a> that would house its three core franchises, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, along with the studios that work primarily on those titles.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an alleged leaked memo from within Ubisoft reported today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/">Insider-Gaming</a> seems to provide some insight into how things will be changing for the company and the impacted studios moving forward. Insider-Gaming claims the memo is from Ubisoft Montreal general manager Christophe Derennes, who now appears to have taken on the role of 'Zone 1 managing director,' per the new structure the company is shifting to with this new subsidiary.</p>
<p>For now, this memo reveals less about Ubisoft's current plans going forward and instead shows that Ubisoft is still working out exactly how this new subsidiary will be structured. The only thing that seems sure is that big changes will be coming to some of its biggest studios in Canada.</p>
<p>You can read an excerpt from the memo below.</p>
<p><em>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization.</em></p>
<p><em>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan. [...] While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</em></p>
<p>We contacted Ubisoft for a comment on this story but did not hear back in time for publication. If we get a comment, we'll update this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More than <strong>1.5 million</strong> players jumped into the post-apocalyptic world of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> in the game's opening weekend, publisher and developer Rebellion announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The single-player survival action game that took the nuclear apocalypse to Britain arrived on current-gen consoles and, notably, Xbox's Game Pass subscription service this past Thursday, March 27, 2025. Which means it reached this milestone in just five days.</p>
<p>In a press release, chief executive officer and co-founder of Rebellion, Jason Kingsley expressed his joy about how the game has been received so far, saying "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</span></p>
<p>For years now, the most popular post-apocalyptic game about a nuclear war ending the world as we know it, Fallout, was always set in the USA. That's due mainly to Fallout always being a commentary on the United States, as Todd Howard explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">last year</a>, but that didn't stop fans of the series from wanting to explore a post-nuclear war world outside America's borders.</p>
<p>That's why we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a>, the Fallout 4 mod that overhauls the entire game to bring the flavor of Fallout from the US to the UK. Just ahead of Fallout: London's release, though, Atomfall was first revealed during Xbox's 2024 Summer Showcase, and now we have two variations of what post-nuclear war Britain looks like.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside, but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series," Kingsley continued. </span>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game."</span></p>
<p>While Atomfall is surely benefiting from the 'Game Pass' effect of having millions of players being able to just jump in and try it at no extra cost, even considering that, it's still an impressive launch for a new IP from an independent publisher and developer.</p>
<p>In our review of Atomfall, we praised the game for its narrative and approach to exploration, but as it stands just outside of launch, the experience is bogged down by a number of bugs and a few issues with the voice acting.</p>
<p>So it might be worth waiting for an update to jump in, but definitely still keep it on your radar, as we said "Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</p>
