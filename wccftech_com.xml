			<p>During the Nintendo Partner Showcase, Bloober Team confirmed that Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on September 5 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The September 5 date circulated earlier today after TrueAchievements <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> something about it in their datamining. Since September 5 isn't fall yet, it seems likely the Polish developer was very loosely referring to Fall when it first <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> its release window during Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>



<p>Anyway, the upside is that the game is only a few weeks away from launching. By <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to this page</a>, you can read Kai's hands-on from a recent press event. Here's an excerpt:</p>



<p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</em></p>



<p>During that occasion, Kai also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-qa-we-want-to-cook-this-one-a-bit-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Lead Level Designer Piotr Tylus. Among other things, he inquired about the similarities and differences with the Silent Hill 2 remake:</p>



<p><em>We are sharing our experiences for sure. We provide each other with feedback, so we try to learn our lessons. During development, as you can imagine, there's a lot of iteration going around. You play test and iterate and so on and so on. But we also wanted to make our own thing. I like the analogy from the presentation, that pizzas have different toppings and there is no superior pizza. We want to cook a little bit differently, just to separate ourselves from the other projects we're doing.</em></p>

			<p>Nintendo kicked off its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> today with an announcement from Capcom, and the reveal that Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. It'll also arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Four years after the launch of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-already-shipped-1-million-units/">sold over 1 million units in its first 10 days</a>, and was eventually able to <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">surpass 2 million units sold</a>, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection continues the story-focused Monster Hunter series with twin Rathalos being born. </p>

<iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Twin Rathalos born in a twist of fate. Their appearance sets the stage for a new tale of Riders and Rathalos to unfold,"</em> reads the video's description. "<em>Become a Rider, bond with monsters, and explore the vibrant world of Monster Hunter in this next evolution of the Monster Hunter Stories series."</em></p>



<p>A press release for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection goes further to explain that the game centers on "<em>two nations on the path of ruin</em>," and that the emergence of two Rathalos brings a sense of despair instead of hope, as both monsters have the strength to cause even more destruction while two nations are at war.</p>



<p>Players will play as the heir to Azuria, who is the sole Rathalos rider and sets out on a journey to uncover a phenomena that threatens the whole world. </p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/">Devil May Cry 5 </a>has been Capcom's strongest-selling game for its first quarter of FY2026, you'd be mistaken to put out Monster Hunter Wilds, which had an incredibly strong launch and in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuoxk57s2j">US alone</a> has been the best-selling game of 2025 so far. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter has been one of Capcom's strongest series in its portfolio, so it's not surprising that the company wanted to have another Monster Hunter game lined up for next year after Wilds kicked off 2025. Hopefully, we'll have more information on a specific release date soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 580.88) for its GeForce graphics cards. It's optimized for the upcoming game Mafia: The Old Country, due to launch on August 8, as well as the highly acclaimed JRPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-1-4-0-patch-is-now-live-introducing-nvidia-dlss-and-intel-xess-frame-generation-support-visual-polish-across/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> yesterday, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has introduced NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation with update 1.4. NVIDIA has confirmed though that this actually extends to DLSS Multi Frame Generation, allowing owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs to run the game at even higher frame rates. </p>



<p>A recent update also added DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA support to the popular open world zombie survival game 7 Days to Die. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation in the game, with the option to activate DLSS Multi Frame Generation via the NVIDIA app override feature.</p>



<p>Today marks the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Take</a>, a first-person psychological horror game crafted by Surgent Studios, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera</a>. Featuring a cast of acclaimed actors (Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and even Remedy's Sam Lake), Dead Take offers players a nightly visit to a not-so-common haunted mansion. The game will include day one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, here's a video of F1 25 showing off its path tracing glory with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation accelerating frame rates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also had another announcement to make: after a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, GeForce GPUs based on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will transition to receiving quarterly security updates for the next three years (through October 2028). The company notes that lifetime support will reach up to 11 years, 'well beyond' industry standards. Furthermore, they will extend Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system's planned end-of-life, to ensure gamers continue to receive the latest day zero optimizations for new games and apps.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this Game Ready driver (580.88) adds support for 62 new G-SYNC Compatible displays. NVIDIA also fixed several bugs, as noted <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/580.88/580.88-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the driver's changelog</a>:</p>
