			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake continues to be among the most requested remakes of classic JRPGs released in the 90s. Although it is not officially on the horizon, something could be brewing, judging from Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii's reaction to a question related to the highly requested remake.</p>



<p>Speaking during a discussion program shared on YouTube on November 30, the legendary game creator was asked if the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th Anniversary projects</a> are suggesting that the game is being remade. Interestingly, Horii-san did not deny the existence of the remake, replying instead that he cannot say anything about the matter and that he shouldn't be asked about it.</p>



<p>Although Yuji Horii's reaction is most definitely not a confirmation that a Chrono Trigger remake is in the works, the fact that he did not deny its existence could be telling.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the creator of the Dragon Quest series, who also worked on the SNES game as one of its writers, has discussed this highly requested remake in recent months. Back in May, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">a translation error made during Horii-san's appearance at the Napoli Comicon </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank">sparked hopes of a remake</a>, which is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/">only being considered for a possible HD-2D overhaul</a>, rather than</span> a full-blown remake.</p>



<p>Chrono Trigger was originally released for the SNES in 1995 and later ported to the Nintendo DS, PC, and mobile platforms. These enhanced ports include additional content not found in the original release, such as new dungeons, a new final boss, and a new ending which connects the game better with its sequel, Chrono Cross, which was <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition-iconic-yet-underserved/">remastered as The Radical Dreamers Edition in 2022. </a></p>



<p>Hopefully, these enhanced ports won't be the last we hear of what is widely considered one of the finest JRPGs ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Halts Tencent From Promoting Light of Motiram During Horizon Lawsuit, Court Dates Set for January 2026]]></title>

            <guid>1370551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first showcased Light of Motiram, practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">everyone online looked at it and pegged it as a clone/rip-off of Sony's Horizon series</a>. So it wasn't that much of a surprise to onlookers when Sony issued a lawsuit against Tencent, calling it a "<em>slavish clone</em>." Now, a new report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">The Game Post</a> reveals that the suit has moved into its next phase, during which Tencent has agreed not to promote Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>This new phase is also a slowing of the proceedings between Sony and Tencent, with both sides asking the court to extend the current briefing period and to schedule the court hearings on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">Tencent's motion to dismiss the case</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">Sony's recent injunction</a> to the same date in January 2026. </p>



<p>In the meantime, according to the latest filing, which was submitted to the Northern District of California on December 1, both sides have, according to the report, "<em>engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agree, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction, (b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the</em> <em>Light of Moitram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction</em>."</p>



<p>The hearings for the motion to dismiss and the injunction will both take place on January 29, 2026, and ahead of that, Tencent will file its reply to Sony's injunction on December 17, 2025, with Sony's reply to that reply set for January 2, 2026. Basically, everyone is taking a big breath, and in the meantime, they'll prepare for what could be the conclusion of this suit by January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Especially if the current discussions both sides have engaged in prove fruitful, and an agreement is able to be reached even before we get to the hearings in January.</p>

			<p>Work on the Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP multiplayer mod is proceeding at an impressive pace, culminating in a recent closed test that has reportedly exceeded all development team expectations.</p>



<p>The primary goals of this highly successful test were crucial for improving the experience, including checking improved synchronization between vehicles and players, introducing a new overlay, and evaluating the overall stability of the platform under load. Judging from new footage shared online by the development team, the test appears to have been a resounding success. A Race Event held during the test ran notably well and, honestly, looks like a ton of fun, demonstrating smooth vehicle handling and client-side synchronization.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod footage also provides a quick look at a PvP event set on a wide map not available in the vanilla game. Much like the race event, this looks intense and engaging, showcasing the potential for large-scale player conflicts within Night City. It is clear that while the core system is solid, further work will be needed to iron out the remaining issues.</p>

<p>Although the project has been in the works since before 2024, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP mod was officially announced only last year</a>. The team is stepping in to address the lack of an official multiplayer mode, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/">being developed by CD Projekt Red but was ultimately canceled to focus entirely on the single-player experience. </a>It's worth noting that the mod does not allow players to complete story quests together via a co-op mode. Instead, it leverages the game's mechanics to offer diverse multiplayer experiences, such as the racing and PvP events highlighted in the latest footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it won't take much longer for the community to experience the solid work the CyberMP mod development team is doing. More information on this <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> multiplayer mod can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eWQbTncXbr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Discord server.</a></p>
