			<p>As rumored in the past few days, PlayStation State of Play will return this week to provide new information on games coming to PS5 in the future.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the 40-plus-minute show that will celebrate <em>"a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world"</em> will begin on February 12th at 2pm PT / 5pm ET | 11pm CET / February 13th at 7am JST. As usual, the show will be streamed on YouTube and Twitch in English and Japanese.</p>
<p>With games like Ghost of Yotei and <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> scheduled for release this year on PlayStation 5, there's a very good chance we will learn precisely when the two games will be released during tomorrow's State of Play. The show may also feature some surprises, including the announcement of a collection featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/">remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series</a>. The release date for Rogue Factor's Hell is Us, which was revealed to be September 4th yesterday, is likely going to be confirmed during the show as well. Hopefully, tomorrow's presentation will also hold more surprises, as the previous State of Play did back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">September</a> when the aforementioned Ghost of Yotei was officially revealed.</p>

			<p>CCP Games has announced that EVE Frontier will be getting a 10-day free trial, where players who register as 'Remnants' will get to experience the new Space Survival MMO as the development continues on in the Closed Alpha. On February 14, players will be able to dive into the game and see what they can expect from it over a ten-day period. As long as you have registered an account, you will be able to dive into it completely free. This trial will be available for both <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/40wUM3LFZOlUcZfxEIZrYK?si=fe598053f71a40e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC and Mac users</a>. A teaser trailer to celebrate the free trial has been posted on the EVE Frontier YouTube channel. You can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier - Free Trial | PC &amp; Mac" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/phOVTd-7QBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is a player-driven Space Survival MMO created by CCP Games, where you are cast out into a vicious cosmos, lost to time and light. To be able to survive out there, you will need to explore space, exploit it when needed, and expand your base to be able to fend off against evil forces. The Frontier, in particular, is a shattered region of space that is continuously being warped by nearby supermassive black holes.</p>
<p>Thus far, EVE Frontier has been in Closed Alpha since 10 December 2024. People are able to access the Closed Alpha by acquiring Founder Access, which will give players access to the Closed Alpha, where they will have persistent access throughout every update and development that is released for the game. Along with this, those with Founder Access will be able to provide feedback for the developers and get special rewards such as cosmetics, access to developer streams, and more. If this sounds like something you would want to purchase, you can obtain Founder Access to the game for $39.99. There are <a href="https://wccftech.com/founder-access-for-eve-frontier-announced-closed-alpha-starts-december-10/">multiple tiers</a> available, with all of them offering different rewards.</p>
<p>It's important to note that if you choose to obtain Founder Access, you will be subject to an NDA during this time.</p>
<p>This MMO will be free-to-play once it launches, with an optional subscription that will be available.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more information about EVE Frontier, there is an <a href="https://www.evefrontier.com/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansive FAQ</a> available on the official website that dives into cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and open-sourcing for those who want to know more about the ins and outs of EVE Frontier.</p>
<p>Will you be playing EVE Frontier during the free trial period? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>A couple of insightful Nintendo Switch 2 videos were shared online, comparing the new system's specs with those of its predecessor and other current generation systems and more.</p>
<p>The new videos, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrameRated">FrameRated</a>, are a great way to learn more about the system's specs, how they compare with those of the other current-generation systems and its predecessor, how a comparable PC GPU, the RTX 2050 mobile, handles multiplatform games, what developers will be able to achieve with the system, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Nintendo Switch 2 VS Switch 1: Hardware Specs Compared" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-iSleivk6w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A second video released a few days earlier also discusses the Nintendo Switch 2 ARM Cortex A78C CPU, whether it may be able to handle future tech, and how memory bandwidth could be a concern in certain cases. You can check out this second video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU: ARM Cortex A78C - is it Powerful Enough?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_PRdx02Slk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it is not yet known when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide, some people online <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claim</a> to have already obtained a unit, such as a Chinese user who obtained a CAD model of the system. If this user's claims are true, then we may be getting more information on the console sooner than early April, when Nintendo will properly unveil the new system in a dedicated Direct.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released later this year worldwide. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/</link>

			<p>Remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series will be revealed soon, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Reddit user<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1im4gtf/comment/mc0td3a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Feeling-Examination6</a>, the three games will be announced during this week's yet-to-be-confirmed State of Play and will be released as part of a collection of some sort later this year. If these remasters are real and coming, it will be very interesting to see how much they will be improved over the already available PlayStation 3 remasters of the first two entries in the series and the remaster of the third released on PlayStation 4 ahead of the release of 2018's God of War.</p>
<p>While we have to take the news about these God of War remasters with a grain of salt, there's some reason to believe the information shared by Reddit user Feeling-Examination6. Just yesterday, the user revealed the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/17kFt49uUj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hell is Us release date</a> before it was confirmed earlier than intended on the Xbox Store. The user also revealed that Ninja Gaiden would be coming back this year, although this could have been a lucky guess, considering the user talked about a reboot, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is not.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the popular series is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, which is now available on PC and PlayStation consoles. The game was going to be followed by a live service game in development by Bluepoint Games, which was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">canceled</a> along with Bend Studio's next project.</p>
