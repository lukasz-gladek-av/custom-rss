			<p>Although the system has only been out for less than a year, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> has already received some impressive third-party ports such as <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em></strong>, which have been highly optimized to deliver great experiences in both <strong>docked and handheld modes</strong>. </p>



<p>The next multiplatform game that is likely to leave most users impressed is <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong>, which runs so well on the <strong>Switch 2</strong> that the development team almost couldn't believe it.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://youtu.be/XJ8BrLpv3AQ"><strong>Creator's Voice video</strong></a> released today, Game Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> revealed how the team was originally skeptical of how the new generation Nintendo system could run the game.</p>



<p><em>"Nintendo Switch 2 has improved graphical specs, so we wondered if Requiem could run on it – and it did, with ease,"</em> <strong>Nakanishi-san</strong> said. <em>"When we, the development team, first saw it in our hands, we were sceptical too, so we had to do a triple take. We thought to ourselves, ‘Oh, is this really running on Nintendo Switch 2?’ It all worked so smoothly that we decided to just go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the console. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great."</em></p>



<p>Besides stressing how <strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> runs well on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, <strong>Nakanishi-san</strong> also praised <strong>GameChat</strong>, noting how it's a good fit for the game. <em>"Even for those who think playing alone is too much, they can just invite a friend to watch, and they can get excited together. I feel like it was almost made specifically for Resident Evil,"</em> the game director said.</p>

			<p><strong>Nixxes Software</strong> has just shared the full PC system requirements for <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>. Powered by the <strong>Decima Engine</strong> just like its predecessor (and the Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West games), the game appears to have reasonable specs. Nixxes has also introduced a Portable preset that will be aimed at handheld gaming devices, such as the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will also include <strong>all of the main PC upscaling and frame generation options</strong>: <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>, <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong>, and <strong>Intel XeSS 2</strong>. It was not, however, clarified whether the NVIDIA DLSS 4 implementation includes <strong>Multi Frame Generation</strong> and support for the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS 4.5 second-generation Transformer model</a></strong> via the NVIDIA app. </p>



<p>There won't be any fancy new additions like ray tracing. However, there is native support for Ultrawide displays, with all of the cutscenes designed to be displayed in a 21:9 aspect ratio. The even wider 32:9 aspect ratio is also supported, but only during gameplay.</p>



<p>Even players with high-resolution 16:9 displays can enable widescreen aspect ratios in the display settings to experience the broader field of view, without requiring an ultrawide monitor. The option to play Death Stranding 2 in 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio will also be available on PS5 at the same time as the PC release via an update.</p>

<p>Additionally, the previously announced <strong>Porter Suit: Link</strong> and <strong>Patch: Link </strong>will be rewarded to all PS5 Porters via an update when the PC version launches. PC players can get obtain these items as a bonus reward for connecting their PlayStation account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new <strong>Shrouded Sky</strong> update for <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't a major expansion or anything, but it almost feels close to that kind of update, because it includes more than a few significant changes. A slew of weapons have been given nerfs to try and better balance PvP play, an element of progression that wasn't benefiting half of the player base is now gone, there are two new ARC threats to take down, and that's before getting to the fact that there's a whole hurricane for players to deal with now.</p>



<p>The update is now live, with the full <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">patch notes available on the game's official website</a> if you're looking to read through them in full. Some of the highlights are things we already heard about when Embark <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-raiders-hurricane-map-condition-arrives-in-shrouded-sky-update-next-week/">teased the update last week</a>, like the new <strong>Hurricane map condition</strong> and the benefits of braving an expedition Topside with winds raging and debris constantly flying across the map.</p>



<p>What we didn't know about until Embark started to provide more details about the update, just ahead of its release, is the introduction of <strong>two new ARC threats</strong>. One is called the <strong>Comet</strong>, which essentially acts like a bigger version of a <strong>Pop</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-guide-the-most-annoying-arcs-and-how-to-deal-with-them/">one of the ARCs to make our list of the most annoying ones to deal with</a>). Once a Comet spots you, it'll charge you and try to explode at your feet. </p>



<p>Its considerably larger size compared to a Pop makes it more deadly if you are unfortunate enough to get hit by its explosion, and the fact that it roams around outside means it's yet another ARC to be concerned about third-partying you, whether you're caught in a fight with other ARCs or Raiders. At least Pops are usually confined to specific areas. These will track and follow you if you're not careful.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The other new ARC is another aerial machine called a <strong>Firefly</strong>. Embark calls it "<em>a <strong>floating nightmare</strong></em>," because it's a flying version of a <strong>Fireball</strong>. A very literal take on the name 'Firefly,' this ARC will circle you like a <strong>Wasp</strong> or <strong>Hornet</strong>, but instead of a machine gun or electrical stun shot, it has a flamethrower attached to it, ready to burn you to a crisp. It's also armoured, so while the usual strategy of going for its thrusters still applies, you'll want to ensure you're carrying something with some heavy firepower to take it down quickly.</p>



<p>Also new in this update is a change to the <strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong> map, with the introduction of a new "<em>high-security area</em>" with high-value loot called the <strong>Controlled Access Zone</strong>. There's also a new Project for Raiders to undertake, in which Shani asks you to collect resources to build a <strong>Weather Monitoring System</strong>, and like all other projects, you'll earn rewards with each new tier of the project you clear.</p>



<p>There are also new cosmetics to unlock with a new free <strong>Surgeon Raider Deck</strong>, which adds facial hair to character customization, and new cosmetic bundles like the new <strong>Volare Set</strong>, which is available alongside today's update, to be followed by the <strong>Devotee Set</strong> coming later.</p>

<p>As for the weapons getting nerfed, the <strong>Stitcher, Kettle, </strong>and <strong>Venator</strong> are all getting damage nerfs. All three are getting base damage reductions, with the Stitcher and Venator getting headshot damage reductions. The <strong>Jupiter</strong> and <strong>Aphelion</strong> are both getting buffed slightly, though not to their damage. You'll now be able to swap from the Jupiter to your secondary faster, while the Aphelion's reload time, time between shots, and recoil have all been reduced, and its ADS time has been improved. Essentially, it shoots faster, reloads faster, and it's faster to aim with.</p>



<p>There's also been a rebalancing of item values, and you can now craft Energy Clips at the Workbench by default. And on top of all of that, there is a slew of bug changes to check out in the patch notes, including fixing the bug that caused players to have to close and re-open the game because they earned a skill point after their last match, and it didn't properly register.</p>
