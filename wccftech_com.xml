			<p>A new <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store Holiday sale</a> has just started, mere weeks after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday/Cyber Monday one</a>, and it begins with a big freebie: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Avalanche Software's acclaimed open world third-person action/adventure game released in 2023 can be added permanently to your Epic Games Store library through December 18 at 5 PM.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Epic Games has partnered with publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (which might be sold to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, depending on which company gets Warner Bros.) to promote Hogwarts Legacy across its games. Players who spend at least two hours in the world of Hogwarts Legacy (via the Epic Games Store) by December 18 at 11 AM Eastern Time can earn the Chocolate Frog Back Bling in Fortnite. This, of course, also applies to those who may have previously purchased the game via the store and spent two or more hours in the game. Later in December, the Fortnite Shop will feature outfits and accessories inspired by the Wizarding World. Players can customize each outfit to represent one of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.</p>

<p>Rocket League is also celebrating the Harry Potter franchise as part of its annual Frosty Fest event. In the Hogwarts House Rivalry, players earn points by playing matches while representing a house. Players will also be able to celebrate their favourite house with challenge rewards and shop items. More details will be announced later this month.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game in 2023</a>, beating even Call of Duty that year. <span>A Definitive Edition featuring additional content&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank">was reportedly in the works</a>&nbsp;with the help of Rocksteady; however, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled this project</a>.</span> </p>



<p>A sequel was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be WBIE's top priority, which was no surprise given its excellent sales (over 35 million units to date). Of course, it will take some time to materialize. Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in February 2023</a> and received support for a while; taking a guess, Avalanche Software could be targeting a launch for the sequel at some point in 2028.</p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 literally swept the floor during last night's The Game Awards 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning nine out of ten of the prizes it got nominated for</a>, including Game of the Year and Studio of the Year for its developer. It's a massive victory for a relatively small indie team that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent less than $10 million making this title</a>.</p>



<p>As if gamers couldn't love them enough already, the French developer has now dropped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased</a> sizable (and free) new update, version 1.5, which adds new features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0-fsr-4-0-2-now-available-next-gen-neural-rendering-technologies-fsr-redstone-ready-for-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD FSR 4</a> on PC and even new content, such as Verso's Drafts, a new playable environment that takes the characters of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover. Verso's Drafts is located on the world map right next to Lumière and becomes accessible from Act III. Esquie's underwater ability is required to access the environment.</p>



<p>That's far from the only addition of the so-called 'Thank You' update. New Luminas and weapons have been added; there are new costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving players even more customization options; there are new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower, variations of iconic bosses from the main game that are designed to be even more challenging.</p>



<p>The "Old Key" quest item has been added to the final area of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This specific item was previously only obtainable during the game's prologue, so this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough. New text and UI game localizations are available in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come, according to Sandfall.</p>

<p>Update 1.5 also introduces the following features: </p>



<ul>
<li>Lumina Sets, which enable players to save up to 50 different Lumina loadouts, allowing them to adapt their fighting tactics at any moment. </li>



<li>An Abandon Battle option in the pause menu is available and it can now be opened in battle.</li>



<li>A Photo Mode is now in the game with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing their favourite moments from the game. It's accessible at any time from the pause menu.</li>



<li>A HUD Scale setting has been added to the game so that players may adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%.</li>



<li>Input remapping is available for controllers.</li>



<li>The game is now officially certified for the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are, of course, plenty of bug fixes too. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
