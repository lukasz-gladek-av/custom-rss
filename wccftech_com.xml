			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>
