			<p><strong>NVIDIA's</strong> popular <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> cloud streaming service is celebrating its <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-turns-six-users-streamed-over-1b-hours-to-date/">sixth anniversary</a> this month, and for this week's GeForce NOW Thursday, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-battlefield-season-2/"><strong>12 games</strong> are getting added</a> to the service, which has expanded to include over <strong>4,500 games.</strong></p>



<p>The only unfortunate aspect of this week's batch of games is that only two of them are arriving as <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> titles, but at least both of those titles are brand new releases. The games in question are <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-review/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a></strong>, both of which you can check out reviews for on Wccftech.</p>



<p>On top of those titles, players will also be able to check out <strong>Norse: Oath of Blood</strong>, which, alongside the aforementioned games, also supports NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-styx-blades-of-greed-star-trek-voyager/">DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation</a>. And though they may not be brand-new titles, players will now be able to check out most of the <strong>Trine Collection</strong> through GeForce NOW, as Trine 1 through 4 are now all included in the cloud streaming library.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games getting added to the cloud streaming library this week:</p>

While that version was a significant visual step up from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wii U</strong> original, it notably lacked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS gameplay</strong>, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/"><strong>high framerate mode</strong></a> being discovered hidden deep within its files.</p>



<p>As many speculated at the time, that discovery was clearly groundwork for the <strong><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em></strong>, which officially launched digitally worldwide today.</p>



<p>Announced via a new launch trailer, this updated version brings <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4K resolution support</strong> in Docked mode and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS gameplay</strong> to the planet <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mira</strong>.

In both cases, the new resolution ranges are a considerable improvement over the original Switch's 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked resolution ranges.</p>

			<p>Just as things were starting to look up for <strong>Bungie</strong>, with some positive buzz building around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">Marathon</a></strong> as we inch closer to the new extraction shooter's arrival, the tides take a turn for the worse once again. In a statement shared on its social media channels, the studio has announced that the next major update for <strong>Destiny 2</strong>, the upcoming <strong>Shadow and Order</strong> update, which was supposed to be out on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> has been <strong>delayed by</strong> <strong>three months</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>June 9, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>A lack of promotional marketing for the update this close to its initially intended release already had players suspecting a delay would be announced, alongside the fact that the update would have been out just days ahead of Marathon, which arrives on March 5, 2026. Bungie fans and anyone who wanted to try out Marathon would have also just finished playing it for a whole weekend during its server slam test, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">which runs from February 26 to March 2</a>.</p>



<p>Instead of squeezing in the launch of a new update and a new game into one week, the Shadow and Order update will now arrive a little more than three months after its initial date. To make matters worse, if the delay time didn't raise concerns about the state of the update, Bungie's statement surely will, as the delay isn't to give Marathon more space to breathe or give the studio time to fix a significant bug they've recently discovered. It's to give the update <strong>"<em>large revisions</em>,"</strong> including changing the title of the update and give the team time to bring <em>"sizable</em>" quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is <strong>undergoing large revisions and will be delayed</strong>,</em>" Bungie begins in its statement. "<em>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will <strong>also be renamed</strong>. This update will now launch on <strong>June 9, 2026</strong>. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April)."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course, the changes being made to this update could, and likely will, ultimately be for the better. But announcing such major changes this close to release, for something that is not the game's next big expansion, and just a mid-season update, clearly points to there having been not just one, but several mishaps along the way. Delays and changes like this are rarely due to just one thing going wrong, and it doesn't inspire confidence in Destiny fans who now have to wait months for an update they thought they'd get to check out in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Especially after its last major update, which was the arrival of its Star Wars-themed <strong>Renegades</strong> expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">failed to revitalize the player base</a>. Hopefully, when Bungie is ready to talk about the update closer to release, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>
