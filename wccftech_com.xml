			<p>The action survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">Forever Skies</a> from Polish developer Far From Home has launched in 1.0 and is out of early access today, April 14, 2025. It's currently available to download on both PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Forever Skies originally launched on PC in early access on June 22, 2023, and developer Far From Home has spent the last nearly two years updating and, at times, overhauling it to prepare for today's 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>Speaking of new content, today's 1.0 launch includes a bunch of new content, including the addition of biomes, new locations, and new colossal lifeforms, advancements to airship building with new designs for players to dig into, new tools and technologies for players to use, some balance tweaks, performance optimizations, and, of course, the final chapter of the story.</p>
<p>"<em>Weâ€™re extremely proud to be launching Forever Skies 1.0 officially today,</em>" chief executive officer of Far From Home Andrzej Blumenfeld said in a <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/we-have-lift-off-soar-into-the-skies-as-forever-skies-1-dot-0-officially-launches-today-on-pc-and-playstation-r-5-3381096">press release</a> about the launch.</p>
<p>"<em>We spent 21+ months in Early Access, working really closely with our community who helped us to shape the game every step of the way. So to them and everyone who got behind us, we want to say a massive thank you!</em>"</p>
<p>We reviewed Forever Skies in its early access state a few months ahead of this 1.0 launch, and at the time, even in early access, it was already a very impressive title.</p>
<p>"<em>Forever Skies has a great, relaxing core gameplay</em> <em>loop</em>," we wrote in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>"The atmospheres are vibrant, but still provide the feeling of desolation and complete loneliness. It's very easy to dive into, once you get past the laggy and broken cutscene at the beginning of the game. Overall, Forever Skies is a great experience, and significantly less overwhelming than other games in this genre."</em></p>
