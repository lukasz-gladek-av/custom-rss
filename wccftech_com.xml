			<p>In a surprising turn of events, Avowed, the latest title being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, can be purchased using <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/31218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Gold and WoW Tokens</a>. Admittedly, the process to do so is incredibly convoluted and quite time-consuming. However, if you have a ton of gold knocking about in World of Warcraft that you don't know what to use it on, Avowed is certainly an option. If you want to use WoW Gold but don't quite have enough to be able to purchase the $70 game, you will have until February 18, 2025, as that is when the game officially releases.</p>
<p>To break down the process for anyone who is unsure about what WoW Tokens are or how to use it, it basically means that in-game gold can be given a real-life monetary value if you manage to sell it on the Auction House in World of Warcraft. However, to sell the gold you have in WoW, you have to purchase WoW Tokens. Typically, WoW Tokens are used to provide 30 days of game time to the game without having to subscribe using your actual money. To do this requires a lot of grinding to make the gold, as it can be quite expensive, and the total cost of a WoW Token fluctuates constantly.</p>
<p>Should you find yourself sitting on a pile of around 262,365 gold, you will be able to purchase a WoW Token in-game using the Auction House. Alternatively, you can purchase one from Blizzard for $20 and keep hold of it or sell it on the Auction House in-game. When the token is sold, you can exchange the gold received from the Token for roughly $15, as Blizzard takes a cut for tax purposes.</p>
<p>To be able to purchase the base edition of Avowed alone, you would need to be able to exchange five WoW Tokens to get enough balance on Battle.net to purchase the game. For most people, having the amount of gold that equates to five WoW Tokens is pretty unrealistic, as you'll need to have a whopping 1.3 million gold. To be able to get this amount would require a lot of non-stop grinding, farming, and selling resources at the Auction House, and it isn't really worth it.</p>
<p>However, if you really want Avowed, the game will be available on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-is-now-available-for-pre-order-day-one-game-pass-release/">variety of platforms</a>, including PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate, where you can play it on day one. Of course, you can also purchase it outright, with the cheapest edition costing $69.99 and the most expensive version costing a hefty $94.99.</p>
