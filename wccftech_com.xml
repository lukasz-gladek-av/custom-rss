			<p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix is live now on the popular free-to-play battle royale game. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking example</a> set with Fortnite Season OG, the island has been reset to the Chapter 2 map, albeit with several twists that will unroll throughout the season.</p>
<p>Starting right now, the Agency grounds are now known as The Doggpound, the new headquarters and home base for Snoop Dogg's enterprise. Players who venture there will have the opportunity to fight him and turn him into an ally, as well as obtain his Snoop's Drum Gun Mythic weapon.</p>
<p>In the second week of Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix, Eminem himself will take ownership of the Grotto cave and establish a restaurant called Mom's Spaghetti there. If you head to Mom's Spaghetti and defeat Eminem, you'll gain his support and receive the Mythic RG Minigun - a lyrical, rapid-fire weapon.</p>
<p>In the third week, hip-hop rapper Ice Spice is set to appear on Shark Island, which will temporarily be renamed Ice Island. Ice Spice is turning it into an ominous-looking shopping mall. If you defeat her, you're getting her support and the Ice Spice's Grappler weapon.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale event, which will go live on November 30 at 2 PM Eastern Time, will feature a homage to Juice Wrld. All players who log in between November 30 at 1 AM Eastern Time and December 1 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest news for Fortnite is arguably the imminent addition of a brand new cosmetic item called 'Kicks.' Epic Games explained:</p>
<p><em>The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite originals. Look out for other brands to join the lineup in the future! Kicks will be compatible with over 500 of the most popular Fortnite Outfits to start, with more than 95% of Outfits compatible by Spring of next year. While there are a few Outfits that are particularly challenging to style Kicks for, we’re working hard to make sure that as many Outfits as possible can throw on a fresh pair.</em></p>
<p>The first pair of Nike Air Jordan Kicks will be available from the Shop starting on Tuesday, November 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is seemingly doing well for itself so far. It had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> Steam concurrency records for a BioWare and EA single-player premium game yesterday, and the numbers have improved since, with a new peak of 77.4K registered twelve hours ago.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, there are no plans to make any story DLCs for it. That's what Rolling Stone&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a></span> as part of an interview with Dragon Age: The Veilguard Creative Director John Epler. The reason is fairly straightforward: BioWare isn't a large team nowadays, and they are currently focused on making the next Mass Effect game, which Executive Producer Mike Gamble recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> will stick to the photorealistic art style and mature tone.</p>
<p>Of course, this interview was conducted when the game had only just released. If Dragon Age: The Veilguard turns out to surpass EA's sales estimates (CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors it has breakout potential), there's a chance those plans might change. Still, from a narrative standpoint, Veilguard does close up nicely (unlike Inquisition, which very much needed the DLCs to really bring the story to a proper conclusion).</p>
<p>In the Rolling Stone interview, John Epler went into the feedback that BioWare absorbed from its fans to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a better game. From Mass Effect Andromeda, the studio learned that the polish wasn't enough and that the open world design was lacking:</p>
<p><em>I do think Andromeda was a better game than its reception suggested, but on the flip side, I don’t think the reception was unfair. At the time of launch, there were technical issues and things that didn’t work.</em></p>
<p><em>We had been doing Dragon Age pre-production on versions of Dragon Age 4, and we did have a version that was a lot more open-world. But again, we ran into the same problem of how do you make it compelling or narratively interesting? The reception to Andromeda definitely solidified that.</em></p>
<p>From Anthem, of course, they understood that the multiplayer focus was not working:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio built to make single-player RPGs. And more importantly, I think a lot of people have come here to build single-player, story based RPGs. So, it just kind of ended up making more sense to make this game the way it is versus a multiplayer game.</em></p>
<p><em>We were alienating parts of our fan base that had been with us for a long time, and not successfully bringing in anyone else through the multiplayer side of things. The reception to Anthem was very clear in that we needed to get back to those aspects that we did well, and multiplayer became an obstacle in the way of doing just that.</em></p>
<p>With that said, Epler did not entirely close the door to doing another multiplayer game in the future:</p>
<p><em>It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game. Final Fantasy XIV does an excellent job. Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world and the world changes.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, Epler said Inquisition players felt there wasn't enough companion banter, which was also fixed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
