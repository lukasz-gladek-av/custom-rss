			<p>July 2025 kicked off with devastating news for Microsoft employees, as it laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 workers across the entire company,</a> with a significant number of those layoffs hitting Xbox and Microsoft's gaming division. <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">game projects</a> were shut down, veteran developers were either laid off or<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"> left</a> because of the cuts, and amid reports that the layoffs are directly related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft wanting to invest more in its AI efforts</a>, Microsoft and Xbox executives have failed to read the room multiple times.</p>



<p>While claims were circulating that Microsoft and Xbox are<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> "<em>trying their damndest to replace jobs with AI agents</em>,"</a> it was unfortunate, to say the least, that a seemingly automated invite went out to developers inviting them to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">how AI tools can aid in game development</a>. Disdain towards Xbox, Microsoft, and the c-suite executives who didn't lose their jobs compounded when an executive producer at Xbox suggested that <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt">laid-off workers confide in ChatGPT to help them cope with being laid off</a>.</p>



<p>At least executive producer Matt Turnbull's ill-advised LinkedIn post was, at least on the surface, an attempt to help laid-off workers. Principal development lead for Xbox Graphics, Mike Matsel's post, however, is somehow even more tone-deaf and bull-headed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmatsel_the-xbox-graphics-team-is-hiring-folks-with-activity-7349539853866344449-O1G3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Matsel put out a call</a> that the Xbox Graphics team was hiring two roles. He specified that the team is looking for people "<em>with experience with device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience</em>." He then links the two job postings, and tells people to message him directly if the postings on Microsoft's website claim to be closed. </p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and even though putting out a hiring call a little more than a week after mass layoffs is never a good look, it's unfortunately a common occurrence. What cinches Matsel's post as tone-deaf, is that he shares an AI-generated image along with his post, which shows someone working at a desktop, presumably looking at nothing, since the image shows their screen on the backside of the monitor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The comments are, unsurprisingly, filled with people digging into Matsel for posting the image, with one person saying "<em>You could have just sketched an ad on paint, at least it would have been funny. This is just embarrassing.</em>" Another, seemingly referencing Matsel's lack of care in his post, wrote, "<em>I too can post AI slop. Put me on the team, coach!</em>"</p>



<p>You have to wonder whether Turnbull and Matsel made their posts earnestly, or if they were baiting the uproar that both posts have caused. Neither is a good look, because if they earnestly made these posts, then that shows a huge inability to read a room, and a lack of understanding as to how they should communicate with others, whether that's trying to communicate a message of empathy, or opportunity. </p>



<p>If they were baiting the reactions, it's surprising and disappointing to see two high-level executives seeking enjoyment out of a situation that has devastated hundreds of their former coworkers and each of their families. </p>
