			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers know that they have the ability to stream their games through Xbox Cloud Gaming, if they're ever inclined to stream whatever they want to play rather than play it natively on their preferred device. Currently, that option is only available to players who are paying for that top-tier subscription for Xbox Game Pass, but Microsoft's vice president of next generation, Jason Ronald, seems to have hinted that a "<em>more affordable</em>" plan for Xbox Cloud Gaming could be on the way.</p>



<p>During the official Xbox podcast, Ronald and Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox, discussed a variety of topics, including the Cloud Gaming service, and what could be on the horizon for Microsoft's investment in cloud gaming.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal is really simple. We want to bring more games to more people. Cloud gaming is great at that</em>," said Beaumont. He continued to say that achieving that goal would include expanding the service to more countries around the world, and to as many devices as Xbox can.</p>



<p>Ronald, for his part, added "<em>One of the things we see is there's a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that's the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go. And so for us, I think it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable and to make it more accessible to more players, whether that's going into new regions or new ways to actually access the cloud."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ronald stops there, and doesn't go further to say that Microsoft and Xbox are prepared to launch a new tier for Game Pass that's just focused on Cloud Gaming, but that's the obvious way you'd think Microsoft would make its cloud gaming service more affordable, by making a tier that is exclusively streaming-focused, and isn't tied to the rest of the features you get from Game Pass, like being able to download every title natively to your device.</p>



<p>We'll see if that's a path Microsoft ends up choosing. In the meantime, the company is preparing to debut its <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> device at Gamescom 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/iconic-interactive-announces-debut-game-the-oversight-bureau-coming-to-pc-in-2025-and-enhanced-by-nvidia%E2%80%99s-ace-ai-tech.1273206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuJFzmVmm-c">NVIDIA GeForce ON Community Update</a>, developer Iconic Interactive revealed its debut title, <a href="https://theoversightbureau.com/">The Oversight Bureau</a>, a puzzle game that lets players use their voice to progress through the narrative that's enhanced by NVIDIA's ACE AI technology.</p>



<p>The studio calls it an "<em>Orwellian puzzle game</em>" in a press release, with its setting being that you're stuck in something called the CUTE Reprogramming Centre, and won't be released until you're deemed "<em>a more appropiate, more compliant member of society</em>."</p>



<p>If you're wondering how you use your voice to play the game, Iconic Interactive uses its proprietary Narrative Engine and NVIDIA's AI technology ACE to create the gameplay experience where you talk to a character in the game to solve the puzzle.</p>



<p>Regarding its proprietary engine, Iconic Interactive breaks it down "<em>into two parts: one AI model analyzes and understands a player's sentiment, while the other delivers dialogue, behavior and theatrical performance relevant to the character, story, and situation</em>. <em>The innovative approach enabled developers to maintain control of the story while providing players with an unparalleled experience, fully immersing them in the narrative</em>."</p>



<p>Iconic Interactive <a href="https://www.iconicgames.io/#about">calls itself a studio that is embracing AI</a> "<em>to enhance creativity, not replace it.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We're thrilled to be able to show the work we have put into creating a new experience for players and utilizing the advanced tech of the Narrative Engine</em>," said chief executive officer and founder of Iconic Interactive, Junaid Hussain. </p>



<p>"<em>The Oversight Bureau is unlike any other gaming experience, and we cannot wait to bring this to PC screens and allow players to experience the use of AI in a creative and new way. Thank you to NVIDIA for allowing us to showcase our debut title. The team has worked hard on this, and we cannot wait to see its reception at the showcase</em>."</p>



<p>The short clip of gameplay we see in the presentation is interesting, to say the least, but it's not yet clear if The Oversight Bureau works as a full game or if it falls apart beyond what we see in the tech demo shown here. We'll see how the full release fares when it launches on PC this year.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now supported in over 175 games, the GeForce company announced today at Gamescom 2025. The list is about to grow with the likes of Resident Evil Requiem (CAPCOM) and Directive 8020 (Supermassive Games), both due in 2026 with DLSS 4 support and full path tracing to maximize visuals and performance.</p>



<p>Several other games will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 and ray tracing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Black State (stealth action/adventure game from Turkish developer Motion Blur, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-qa-and-exclusive-screens-making-the-best-looking-games-with-best-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> a while ago)</li>

<p>Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>DLSS 4 and path tracing are no longer cutting-edge graphical experiments — they’re the foundation of modern PC gaming titles. Developers are embracing AI-powered rendering to unlock stunning visuals and massive performance gains, enabling gamers everywhere to experience the future of real-time graphics today.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[RTX Hair Is Coming in September to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-hair-is-coming-in-september-to-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle.1273185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA confirmed that the long-awaited RTX Hair feature will debut in September in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>



<p>You might recall that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to arrive back in February alongside the NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. DLSS 4 MFG was indeed introduced with that update, but RTX Hair wasn't. Clearly, NVIDIA and MachineGames still had to iron out some kinks.</p>



<p>RTX Hair leverages linear swept spheres, a new hardware feature introduced with the GeForce RTX 50 Series of graphics cards. This new primitive renders hair with spheres instead of triangles as usual. NVIDIA says this is not only a better fit for the shape of hair but also reduces the amount of geometry needed to render each strand of hair. Additionally, RTX Hair reportedly offers better lighting and shadows while only occupying a small memory footprint. NVIDIA later clarified that in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, linear swept spheres will only be available to Blackwell GPUs, whereas any other GPU will have to stick with the existing hair model.</p>



<p>NVIDIA did not provide any detailed performance data on how RTX Hair will affect the frame rate in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, so we'll have to check that ourselves when the update goes live in a few weeks. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent first-person action/adventure game</a> will also soon get its story-based premium DLC, The Order of Giants, which was included with the Premium Edition and can be bought separately (with the Digital Premium Upgrade) for €35.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony State of Play Coming in September 2025, It’s Claimed – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-coming-in-september-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1273143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has had a State of Play, or some kind of presentation in September every year for the last six years, and according to Jeff Grubb, who has proven to be a reliable source for information ahead of official announcements, they won't be breaking that streak in 2025 with a State of Play, "<em>maybe a Showcase</em>," planned for "<em>before the end of September</em>."</p>



<p>Grubb made his claim during Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, at the 20 minute and 10-second mark while Grubb and his guest, IGN's Seth Macy, were discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">weekend scare that Fairgames from Haven Studios had been canned</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="45-Minute Kirby Air Riders Direct Announced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KYP00kf4GM?start=1221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've heard, - and this one I feel comfortable saying, you can go write headlines about this if you want</em> - <em>they're planning a State of Play, or maybe a Showcase, but probably a State of Play, for the end of September, or before the end of September. So we're gonna hear, we're going to get updates from Sony here pretty soon</em>,<em>" </em>Grubb said.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, we don't know what Sony has lined up for the remainder of 2025, and after Gamescom ONL tomorrow, September would be the perfect opening for Sony to let players know what they can look forward to for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>The last <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play this past June</a> included mostly news for third-party titles and 2026 releases. In the very likely scenario that a September 2025 State of Play is on the horizon, hopefully it includes more news about what's coming from PlayStation and Sony in the next few months.</p>
