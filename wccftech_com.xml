			<p>NVIDIA announced that the Borderlands franchise (with the exception of the spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands) is now available to stream on its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. As you might recall, publisher 2K was among those companies that <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-is-the-latest-publisher-to-remove-its-lineup-from-geforce-now-while-epic-games-vows-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of GeForce NOW</a> when the service first launched out of beta in early 2020.</p>
<p>Something must have changed recently, though. The Mafia franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> GeForce NOW last month, and now it's time for Gearbox's first-person looter shooter games. Moreover, the upcoming Borderlands 4 will be available to stream on day one. Its system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't that high</a>, but it's still welcome news.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is already available on GFN, but BioShock, X-COM, and the sports games (NBA, WWE, Top Spin, PGA Tour) aren't. Will they be the next 2K franchises to join GeForce NOW? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, here's the full list of GFN additions for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>REMATCH (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 16)</li>
<li>Broken Arrow (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>
<li>Crime Simulator (New release on Steam, June 17)</li>
<li>Date Everything! (New release on Steam, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li>Architect Life: A House Design Simulator (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, there are several GeForce NOW promotions in full swing for the Summer Sale, such as 40% discounts on a six-month Performance membership or a <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-40-discount-on-performance-day-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance day pass</a> to try out the cloud gaming service before committing to a more extended subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-reportedly-put-up-for-sale-by-pearl-abyss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On September 6, 2018, South Korean game developer Pearl Abyss (Black Desert) <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> CCP Games and the MMORPG EVE Online, the flagship product of the Icelandic studio, for around $425 million.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years later, Pearl Abyss might be reconsidering their stake in CCP Games. At least, that's what <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report by Korean website MTN</a> alleges today: PA has reportedly reached out to multiple game companies to gauge their potential interest in acquiring CCP Games.</p>
<p>We don't have public visibility on the sales performance of CCP's games, but we do know that there were several missteps along the way, both prior and after the acquisition by Pearl Abyss. Over its nearly thirty-year history, CCP canceled at least four games (an MMO set in the World of Darkness, Project Legion, Eve: The Second Genesis, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Nova</a>), while other projects notoriously fizzled too early, such as Dust 514. For a while, CCP even released several Virtual Reality games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/196685-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE: Valkyrie</a>, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc</a>), although eventually it gave up once it became crystal clear that the VR market was too small.</p>
<p>More recently, CCP <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-frontier-goes-public-today-with-founder-access-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> EVE: Frontier, a survival spin-off of EVE Online, in 'Founder Access'. Perhaps Pearl Abyss isn't thrilled with the direction of Frontier and the other new project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-frontier-vanguard-fanfest-2025-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a>, CCP's umpteenth at a shooter game connected with its MMORPG.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the MTN report alleges that the Korean company would be glad to be rid of this subsidiary and focus on its own games, such as Crimson Desert and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DokeV</a>. This is the same source that <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tentative internal release date for Crimson Desert, by the way, to which Pearl Abyss only referred back to official announcements coming from its own social channels.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll update this article if PA chooses to comment in any way. Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>A new Battlefield Labs update has gone live today, introducing new features to the test version of what will presumably be the next entry in the popular first-person shooter series.</p>
<p>As reported on the franchise's official subreddit, the new patch that went live a few hours ago introduced a few changes and improvements, such as NVIDIA DLSS 4 support and the option to turn off the border around the capture zone. Additionally, the new update has changed the watermark from PRE ALPHA to ALPHA and has added files related to a battle royale mode. With the promise of news coming soon regarding the class system, there's the chance the update has been pushed in preparation for something, possibly the official announcement of the next Battlefield which is still scheduled for this <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">summer.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lf7tkr/new_information_dropped_from_the_1bf_telegram/">New information dropped from the 1BF telegram</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NSGXD/">u/NSGXD</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although Battlefield Labs footage was not meant to be shared, plenty of it has made its way <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">online,</a> providing an early look at what the next entry in the series should offer. Besides the multiplayer modes that select users can test right now, the next entry in the series will also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/">single-player campaign</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">Dead Space remake</a>, which will be influenced by TV shows and movies like Lioness and Civil War.</p>
<p>More information on Battlefield Labs can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
