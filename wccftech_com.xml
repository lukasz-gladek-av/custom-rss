			<p>Korean publisher and developer NCSOFT announced that it has made what it calls "a strategic equity investment" in the independent Texas-based studio Empty Vessel, which is currently working on an immersive shooter called DEFECT.</p>
<p>DEFECT is a multiplayer, cyberpunk-style squad shooter that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/">first revealed in August 2024</a> and will be the debut project from Empty Vessel. The studio is composed of developers who've worked on series such as DOOM, Quake, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted, so there's a lot of talent within the studio.</p>
<p>There's been no word regarding when DEFECT will be ready to release, but this investment is meant to help the game get over the finish line, so we might be close to hearing about a release date. According to Emanuel Palalic, the game director on DEFECT, it's also about providing Empty Vessel with a better environment to make DEFECT.</p>
<p>"<em>We started working on Defect with a simple belief, that great games come from focused, passionate teams who are empowered to take creative risks,</em>" Palalic said in a press release. "<em>That’s why we’re excited to partner with NCSOFT. From the start, they’ve understood our goal, not just to build a game, but to build a better environment for the developers behind it. NCSOFT’s support and expertise will help us take Defect and Empty Vessel to the next level.</em>"</p>
<p>According to a press release for the investment, this is just the beginning of what will be a long-term partnership, which could also include NCSOFT acquiring the publishing rights for DEFECT.</p>
<p>On NCSOFT's side, co-chief executive officer&nbsp;<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Byung-moo Park</span> said "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Empty Vessel is a AAA development studio established by game art and sound experts with successful experience and fandom in the global major genre of shooting games. We will continue to invest in securing new global IPs and building a genre-specific cluster pipeline.</em>"</span></p>
<p>When DEFECT was first announced, the trailer quickly garnered attention, with nearly two million views at the time of writing. Empty Vessel has been quiet since, so it'll be interesting to see how players react when we get a proper look at gameplay.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco released the latest trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, the multiplayer co-op action game due to launch on May 30, 2025.</p>
<p>It's a 10-minute presentation providing an overview of all the basics you'll need to know when jumping into Nightreign, so for the most part, it was a lot of information we've already heard, but we did also get a few new gameplay clips we hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>The presentation was broken into five parts. The first focused on the world of Limveld, which is said to be an ancient world that used to thrive thanks to the power of the gods, now eroding thanks to the terrible night that you and your fellow Nightfarers contend with.</p>
<p>It also talked about how Limveld's layout will change each time you fly in for a new session, and showed some of the different areas we've not yet seen through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">network tests</a>.</p>
<p>The second part focused on the different enemies you'll face, and how you should try to survive the night, whether you focus on leveling up through farming standard enemies, going for bigger, more challenging threats, finding hidden and treasured gear, or all of the above. Regardless of how you prepare for the final big fight against a Nightlord, the best advice the trailer gives is to have a plan before flying into Limveld.</p>
<p>The third chunk of the presentation focuses on the actual Nightfarers you play as in Elden Ring Nightreign. We know there will be eight of them available at launch, and those who have already been in the network test have had the chance to play as four of them: Duchess, Guardian, Wylder, and Recluse. Interestingly, the overview trailer only showed three more, and didn't even talk about one of them.</p>
<p>We saw a little more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-shows-off-ironeye-class/">Ironeye</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjAdGN4-lvU">Raider</a>, two characters who have each received a separate character trailer, and we saw quick clips of Executor, though nothing was discussed about Executor. The overview skips over the Executor and the fact that eight Nightfarers are mentioned, but only seven are shown. It'll be interesting to see when this eighth character is revealed and if there's an obvious reason why FromSoftware would leave it for last. There was a quick shot at someone who could be the eighth character, but it's unclear if that's who they are or if they are an NPC you'll meet in the Roundtable Hold.</p>
<p>The fourth section was a look at the Roundtable Hold, which we know is your base of operations between night raids. It's where you'll level up permanent traits with what you've found on your raids, and we now know it'll be where you can acquire a few familiar cosmetics. Outfits that hearken back to previous FromSoftware games, like the Solaire knight's armor from Dark Souls, will be available to unlock.</p>
<p>Lore hunters will also be happy to know that through gameplay, you'll recover "<em>Fragments of Lost Memory</em>" regarding each Nightfarer, providing hints about who these Nightfarers were before they joined the fight, and why they joined in the first place. What you see in these fragments, and what you learn in the conversations you'll have with other Nightfarers, will also lead to new objectives when you enter into a new session. Completing those objectives will help to reveal who the Nightfarers are fully.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has already made it clear that the world of Nightreign is separate from the world of Elden Ring, but it'll be interesting to see if there's any more information that suggests an overlap or discusses the world of The Lands Between as we've known it for the last three years.</p>
<p>Finally, the overview touched on the Nightlords, the day 3 bosses you'll face at the end of each session, and showed off some intense gameplay of what those fights will look like.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, the overview is a great resource if you want a short look at what you'll need to know when jumping into Elden Ring Nightreign, but it also has some glaring absences that make it more of a tease for what's to come in the full game.</p>
<p>Nightreign is the first multiplayer-focused game by FromSoftware since the studio's popularity took off after Dark Souls began to take over the world. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/">Elden Ring is its most successful release yet</a> with over 30 million sold, and everyone is waiting to see how the studio fares in the multiplayer world, and if the success of their single-player games can translate to online multiplayer games.</p>
