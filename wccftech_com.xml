			<p>The latest <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> collab has been revealed, and it's seemingly just in time to catch <strong>Stranger Things</strong> fans who are looking for anything that makes them feel closer to their favourite show now that it's over. <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> has announced five new Fortnite Islands, all <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> inspired, officially bringing D&amp;D to the popular everything game.</p>



<p>The five islands were made through a collaboration with UEFN creators <strong>Chartis Games</strong> and <strong>Teravision Games</strong>, each of them "<em>inspired by iconic D&amp;D locations, monsters, and gameplay styles ranging from PvP and platforming to a massive co-op roguelike experience</em>," according to a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite</em>," added <strong>Nick Strann,</strong> franchise strategy director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons at Wizards of the Coast. <em>"Supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players. D&amp;D already means so much to all those who have joined us at the table, and we hope that we can make it just as meaningful for millions of&nbsp;</em><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>fans. We very much look forward to hearing player feedback on these creator-made islands and using that feedback to shape future adventures wherever people love D&amp;D."</p>



<p>Here are the five islands and their island codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>DnD Boxfights – Island Code 1190-4691-0255&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Treasure RNG – Island Code 4958-2624-5634&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Dungeon Deathrun – Island Code 5806-6430-0158&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Bossfight – Island Code 2218-1049-5866&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Zombie Dragon Adventure (early access) – Island Code 2525-9596-3235&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Last year, Fortnite had more than a few major collaborations that saw the game go through major environmental changes for a limited time, most notably with its collaborations around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-x-the-simpsons-crossover-introduces-players-springfield-island/">The Simpsons</a>,</strong> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disneyland-game-rush-brings-disney-parks-to-fortnite-starting-tomorrow/"><strong>Walt Disney World</strong> theme parks</a>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">Quentin Tarantino</a> </strong>collaboration. </p>



<p>The official introduction of D&amp;D to Fortnite doesn't seem to be on the same scale as any of those past collabs, but that's likely due to Wizards of the Coast claiming these islands are part of a "<em>launch and learn initiative to explore how D&amp;D can connect with a diverse range of Fortnite players in fun and meaningful ways</em>."</p>



<p>We know how far Fortnite collaborations can go, and how expansive the world of D&amp;D is. If Wizards of the Coast feels good about how the launch of these five islands is received, we may be in for a much grander D&amp;D collaboration with Fortnite in the future.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/deck-nine-games-new-life-is-strange-game-reveal-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised last week</a>, <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> has just announced <strong>Life is Strange: Reunion</strong>, a new entry in the adventure game series published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release describes this as the emotional conclusion to the journey of <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Chloe</strong>, the main characters in the acclaimed first game of the saga. For story reasons we won't spoil here, fans would never have thought the two could meet again, and <strong>yet they will in this new title</strong>.</p>



<p>Players will once again visit the grounds of <strong>Caledon University</strong>, where Max Caulfield works as a photography teacher, as seen in 2024's game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong>. Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the campus and ends the lives of Max's friends, students, and faculty alike. She escapes the devastation only because of her <strong>Rewind power</strong>. After jumping back in time through a selfie, Max now <strong>has just three days to work out how the fire began and prevent it</strong>. </p>



<p>That's when Chloe Price <strong>arrives at Caledon</strong>, much to Max's surprise. This is apparently a shocking repercussion of <strong>Max's merging of the timelines</strong> that happened at the end of Double Exposure. Haunted by nightmares of a past she never lived, and with her grip on reality quickly unraveling, Chloe needs Max's help more than ever. </p>



<p>The standout feature is that, for the first time in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion <strong>lets players play as both Max and Chloe in the same game</strong>, alternating between their perspectives as the story unfolds. Max's Rewind power is, of course, used to undo and redo decisions, change the course of conversations, and manipulate the environment to solve '4D puzzles', while Chloe's Backtalk ability, quick wits, and attitude let her sway key suspects and go where Max cannot.</p>



<p>Deck Nine Games aims to build on the series' grounded storytelling to provide players with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative, all <strong>culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/">In a little over a month</a></strong>, Bungie will release <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Marathon</strong>, an extraction shooter that found itself at the center of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">controversy</a></strong> and was eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">delayed</strong> following its somewhat disappointing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">early showings</strong>.</p>



<p>The launch of the studio's first new IP in years since the launch of Destiny in 2014, however, will be remarkable even for those who own a <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> but may not be fans of the team which created the iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-a-bold-claim-to-reconnect-with-the-community-without-multiplayer-can-halo-campaign-evolved-really-bring-players-back-together/"><strong>Halo</strong></a> back in the days of the original Xbox, as <em>Marathon</em> will be putting the power of the system to some interesting use.</p>



<p>In the game's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/"><strong>landing page on the PlayStation Official Website</strong></a>, it is confirmed that the extraction shooter will be a PS5 Pro Enhanced title. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"PS5 Pro Enhanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) blends 5K internal rendering into a clean, stable 4K image so your Runner’s view stays sharp, even when the action gets hectic,"</em> the dedicated box on the website reads.</p>



<p>Barring a potential mistake, this would make <em>Marathon</em> the first P<strong>layStation 5 Pro Enhanced competitive title that renders internally at 5K resolution</strong>. Although this isn't really surprising, considering the power of the Sony console and how the game doesn't seem to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">extremely demanding</a></strong>, it may have made more sense to tout how the <strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution would deliver a 4K resolution output with 120 FPS support</strong>, which would definitely be preferable for a shooter than the sharpest image quality., </p>



<p>Hopefully, the system will still be able to deliver the high-framerate <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">gameplay experience that is perfect for a game such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marathon</em>, possibly with the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version of PlaySt</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ation Spectral Super Resolution,&nbsp;</strong>which will reportedly be available by March 2026. What is colloquially known as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">PSSR 2.0</a></strong> is said to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/">significantly boost </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/"><strong>performance</strong></a>, which would definitely help a game rendering at a high internal resolution achieve higher framerates.</p>
