            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the TGA 2024 pre-show, French developer Tactical Adventures announced Solasta II, sequel to the solid 2021 cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solasta: Crown of the Magister</a>. Like its predecessor, it is based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, although set in its own world.</p>
<p>The sequel takes place decades after the events witnessed in Crown of the Magister and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palace-of-ice-dlc-for-solasta-crown-of-the-magister-launches-on-may-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palace of Ice DLC</a>. This time, a new band of adventurers will set out on the continent of Neokos, which has been conquered by a powerful, corrupting villain called Shadwyn. Her character will be voiced by Amelia Tyler, the award-winning actress behind Baldur's Gate III's narrator and Hades II's Hecate.</p>
<p>This is an inkling of the 'level up' that Tactical Adventures is planning for Solasta II, which will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 to deliver much more advanced visuals than the first entry, as you can see in the debut trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solasta II - Official Announcement Trailer [TGA 2024]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruN-X04RxFA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the gameplay front, Solasta II will once again allow players to take control of a group of four characters, which will be fully voiced this time, not to mention customizable when it comes to skills and abilities. The online co-op mode feature will be added during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p>Throughout the story campaign, players must navigate the various factions, get to know the inhabitants of Neokos, and most importantly, make wise decisions. Their choices will determine whether they are favored or despised.</p>
<p>Mathieu Girard, the game's Creative Director, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team of 35 combines deep expertise with a passion for crafting immersive and challenging gaming experiences. With our first game, we started as a Kickstarter success story, building on the SRD 5.1 ruleset to create a tactical RPG that has resonated with over 1.5 million players. Now, with Solasta II, we’re taking all that even further – pushing the system with fresh takes on tactical depth, fun and accessibility. Players will explore Neokos, a new continent brimming with magic, colossal landscapes and discover unprecedented lore, while facing the growing force of Shadwyn, a charismatic villain driven by a relentless desire to reclaim her lost power. This project is powered by ambition, respect for our players and a shared belief in the strength of what we’re building together. We can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on it and tell us what they think!</em></p>
<p>Solasta II will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> sometime next year, although a free demo will be shared in early 2025, providing fans with a juicy taste of what's to come. Later today, Tactical Adventures will host a developer live stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a>. It will go live at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST / 6 PM CET, if you'd like to follow it.</p>

			<p>Shortly after its announcement, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> PC system requirements, detailing what players will need to run the game at different resolutions, quality settings, and target framerate.</p>
<p>The minimum system requirements targeting 1080p resolution, Low quality preset, and 30 FPS are not particularly demanding, although the game won't run on really old GPUs such as NVIDIA GTX series cards and anything older than the Radeon RX 6600. Interestingly enough, for 1080p resolution, Medium quality preset, 60 FPS and 4K resolution, High quality preset and 60 FPS, Windows 11 is recommended as the OS alongside beefier CPUs and GPUs. To enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at the highest resolution, highest quality setting, and 60 FPS, players will need either an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Intel i7-10700 CPU and either a Radeon RX 7900 XTX or NVIDIA RTX 4080.</p>
<p>You can find the full Final Fantasy VII Rebirth system requirements below.</p>

			<p>Fumito Ueda, the man behind excellent games like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian, is working on a new project with his team genDESIGN.</p>
<p>This project, which has yet to be named, was revealed yesterday with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBSWSyk9Hg">trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards Show. Published by Epic Games, the yet-to-be-named project looks absolutely like what Fumito Ueda has done in the past, so we should probably expect creative gameplay and a really emotional story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Announcement Trailer For a New Upcoming Game From genDESIGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNBSWSyk9Hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fumito Ueda and genDESIGN's last game was the aforementioned The Last Guardian, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2016 after being in development for over eight years. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-guardian-review/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last Guardian offers something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in games before – a relationship that feels very, very tangible. Trico implies so many things with his animations, his glances, his whines, the way he stomps his feet – he drips with more personality and charisma than any other game character in recent memory, and all of this can be put down to the fact that he’s not just an NPC, not simply an AI model you must direct about a stage, he feels like a friend. A special friend who cries when you are hurt, nuzzles you when you can stand, and demands his belly rubbed if you want him to do some jumps.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5.1060653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the leaked ad that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the launch window of Mafia: The Old Country ahead of The Game Awards 2024, during the actual show we actually got to see the full trailer and learn more about the game. By far the most important tidbit is that, unlike all of its predecessors, Mafia: The Old Country won't be an open-world game. Hangar 13 describes it as a linear, narrative-driven title.</p>
<p>Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a love letter to old-style, gritty Mafia stories where players can uncover the origins of organized crime. Everyone at Hangar 13 is committed to creating the most authentic and intense story of the franchise, and we can’t wait for players to experience the journey with Enzo.</em></p>
<p>The press release from publisher 2K explains that it will be a 'focused package' with a 'graphically stunning cinematic experience'. Its story, set in the fictional Sicilian town of San Celeste, is rooted in the brutal world of organized crime that aims to immerse players in dangerous combat systems with high-stakes, grounded stealth and gunplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Enzo is the game's main character. He survived a childhood of forced labor in Sicily's hellish sulphur mines. Eventually, through a twist of fate, he gets the opportunity to join Don Torrisi's crime family and will do whatever it takes to make a better life for himself. By swearing an oath, Enzo has committed himself to the Torrisi family code of honor, with all the power and hardship that entails. He must never forget this simple truth: family requires sacrifice. To reach his next destination or make a hasty getaway, Enzo will need to gallop across cobbled streets and open fields on horseback or speed along dirt roads in authentic turn-of-the-century cars.</p>

<p>We also learned that Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, marking yet another triple-A studio that switches away from its proprietary engine. The game will be available in Summer 2025 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9p834n9s4ll0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>.</p>
