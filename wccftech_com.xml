			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mod test was shared online this week, highlighting how much the new system can improve ARK: Survival Evolved, one of the worst original Switch ports released to date, even at resolutions higher than the vanilla 1080p.</p>
<p>The new test video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a>, compares the game running on an overclocked Nintendo Switch and on the current generation system with some graphics mods like an FPS unlocker setting the cap to 60 FPS and increased resolution. At base 1080p resolution, ARK runs great on Nintendo Switch 2, consistently hitting the modded 60 FPS cap without the massive stuttering seen on the original console. The new generation system handles 1440p resolution quite well, not hitting the 60 FPS, but keeping a relatively steady 50 FPS range performance that's more than playable. At 4K resolution, however, the system begins to struggle, as the game runs in the 25 FPS range, and textures start showing some issues likely related to RAM, although the absence of the massive stuttering seen on the original system still makes this impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60 FPS / 4K Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY16ahbIAB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those not in the know, seeing Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods already may seem surprising, especially as the console hasn't been hacked yet, but unlocking framerates and increasing resolution in select backward-compatible titles is entirely possible by importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed. Using this method, naga tested out how much the system can be pushed by running games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/">Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation</a> with higher resolutions and unlocked framerates.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods, however, are not needed to enjoy improved backward-compatible titles, as many games can use the system's increased hardware specifications over its predecessor to offer improved framerates and more, even without dedicated patches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Atomic Heart 2 at Summer Game Fest 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish Founder, CEO, and Game Director Robert Bagratuni, whose interviews were often featured on Wccftech throughout the development of the first installment, to learn more about the sequel of the popular first-person shooter game.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole chat, two topics were worth highlighting in a separate story: the greater focus on roleplaying game elements and the larger, more dynamic world that players will find in the sequel. Here are the respective quotes from Bagratuni:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before. </em><em>When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect. Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, Bagratuni also told us that Atomic Heart 2 is 'a few years out', partly because the team wants to improve the sequel's polish, make it tighter and more immersive. However, we'll keep covering any relevant news and rumors throughout the whole development phase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has plenty of new features over its predecessor, including some RPG-lite mechanics like Sam's Stats, which determine how well he performs specific actions. And in true RPG fashion, these stats can be increased during the course of the game, making Sam even better at traversing terrain, resisting getting knocked out by specific attacks, and so on.</p>
<h2>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250627130510-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are self-explanatory, and the in-game menu provides a good overview of how each stat impacts Sam's performance and by how much. What the game doesn't tell you, however, is how to level them up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terrain Traversal</strong> indicates Sam's ability to resist fatigue while traversing difficult terrain, such as rivers and slopes.&nbsp;The higher this stat, the slower Endurance will reduce when he does so. This stat is increased by traversing this difficult terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Carry Capacity</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at carrying cargo, granting him an increased capacity of additional kilograms depending on the stat's level. This stat is increased by traveling with plenty of cargo, the higher the weight, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Endurance</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at resisting fatigue while traveling, which is indicated by the bar located on the Stamina Gauge. The higher this stat, the slower Fatigue will accumulate. This stat is increased by running over long distances.</li>
<li><strong>KO Resistance</strong> indicates how much Sam can resist getting knocked out by specific enemy attacks, losing balance, and dropping cargo. The higher the stat, the harder it will be for enemies to knock the porter off balance and steal his cargo. This stat is increased by blocking enemy attacks and centering Sam's balance while under attack holding the L2 and R2 buttons. Doing so when unbalanced and not in combat does not count.</li>
<li><strong>Lung Capacity</strong> indicates how much Sam can hold his breath using the Stamina Gauge to easily make it past human enemies and BTs undetected. The higher the stat, the higher his lung capacity will be. To increase this stat, all you need to do is hold Sam's breath by pressing the R1 button.</li>
<li><strong>Strand Skills</strong> indicate how good Sam is at binding enemies undetected from behind using his Strand. The higher the stat is, the bigger is the distance from which Sam can bind unaware human enemies. To increase this stat, simply bind enemies using the weapon repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the Stats above, Sam also has <strong>Mastery Stats for weapon types</strong>, which increase Reload Speed and lower Reticle Sway and Recoil the higher they are. Master for each weapon type is increased by defeating enemies with the related weapon type.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Stat to Increase as Quickly as Possible</h2>
<p>While increasing all the stats outlined above provides some tangible benefits, some are more impactful than others and can make Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more enjoyable. <strong>The most important of them, regardless of playstyle, is Carry Capacity</strong>, and it's easy to understand why as soon as the game begins. An increased carry capacity makes it easier for Sam to carry many items, which is beneficial for deliveries and combat. While it's true that vehicles eventually make Carry Capacity not that important later on, there will be plenty of times during the course of the game when you cannot use one, having to rely on Sam's foot to complete a delivery. In combat, having a higher Carry Capacity means being able to carry more weapons, which is always a great help. As such, you will want to increase this stat as quickly as possible, and you can do so already during Sam's time in Mexico at the start of the game. <strong>Make sure to travel as close to maximum carry capacity as possible from one place to the other, avoid enemy camps, and it shouldn't take too long to level up the stat up a couple of ranks</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasing every other stat, however, is entirely dependent on your playstyle. If you like to take on enemies head-on, increasing Lung Capacity and Striking Skills won't be very beneficial for you, and you should focus on Weapon Mastery instead, as well as KO Endurance to avoid getting your cargo stolen in case something goes wrong during a fight. If you're a Metal Gear Solid fan and prefer a stealthy approach, however, Lung Capacity and Strand Skills are more valuable stats to improve. Ultimately, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a very flexible game that can be played with different playstyles, providing everything needed to make any playstyle enjoyable.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rtgi-reshade-shader-receives-its-biggest-update-yet-outperforming-restir-gi-according-to-its-author/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtgi-reshade-shader-receives-its-%E2%80%98biggest-update-yet%E2%80%99-outperforming-restir-gi-according-to-its-author.1229877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It had been six months since Pascal Gilcher, also known as Marty McFly, had released an update for his popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-shader-adds-image-based-lighting-extended-ray-length-multiplier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTGI ReShade shader</a>.&nbsp;However, a new version just became available to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> subscribers, and it's a big one.</p>
<p>The modder tried to implement the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> algorithm in his shader, but encountered several limitations, like chroma noise (because reservoir sampling can only hold light from a single direction), sample correlation that breaks denoiser variance estimation, and white noise output. Eventually, Gilcher decided to design his own sampling algorithm, which he reckons vastly outperforms ReSTIR GI in terms of quality.&nbsp;The RTGI shader has also received significant improvements to its reflections, which now trace pixel-perfect paths using HiZ Min-Max Tracing.</p>
<p>The modder also shared future plans to split RTGI's diffuse and specular components into separate shaders to manage them more easily.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marty's Mods | Update June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PImgAUIoyZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There were also improvements to other Gilcher's shaders, such as MXAO, which saw the fixing of the low-radius halos that manifested around objects, and especially Launchpad, whose optical flow is used by several other shaders. This new version of Launchpad introduces an innovative gradient descent-based algorithm that can handle subpixel shifts more effectively than traditional grid-based search methods.</p>
<p>Users can now choose from two general-purpose gradient descent optimizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton: Converges quickly, making it more suitable for lower-quality settings.</li>
<li>SophiaG: Converges more slowly, but finds better minima, making it a good fit for high-quality settings.</li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Launchpad - Before and After</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Gilcher has released a brand new shader: path traced volumetric fog. It was originally built as a ground truth reference for a real-time effect, but the modder ultimately enjoyed it so much that the full path-traced version is now available in beta testing, although it's meant to be used for screenshots only. Check out the example below, which was captured in God of War.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Before</figcaption></figure>
<figure><figcaption>After</figcaption></figure>
<p>The path traced volumetric fog shader is currently only available at the most expensive Patreon tier, 'Photon Mappers', which costs $20 monthly.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-will-introduce-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-amd-fsr-4-support-on-pc-and-more.1229862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides new content, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 is introducing some new features on PC, the full update notes confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">release date</a> and most significant additions, which include returning monsters Lagiacrus and Seregios, the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Update 2 full notes</a> have gone live, confirming it will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4 support on PC. Multi Frame Generation support is also being added by the update, featuring an Auto option that will dynamically turn frame generation on and off depending on the load. The upscaling and frame generation options will also be separated once the title update goes live, allowing users, for example, to use NVIDIA DLSS for upscaling and AMD FSR frame generation together, or any other combination. Rounding up the PC-specific additions are a warning dialogue that warns the user they are using out-of-date GPU drivers, new customizable keyboard configuration controls, and the option of copying the Lobby ID/ Hunter ID via the Start Menu and the Squad ID via the Squad Menu. Unfortunately, the Title Update 2 notes make no mention of performance or optimization improvements, besides a reduction in VRAM usage, so most users will still have to rely on Frame Generation to hit acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2, which launches next week on June 30, introduces Lagiacrus and Seregios, a Layered Weapons system, and many other features. Next month, hunters will also be able to take on Arch-tempered Uth Duna and participate in a Fender Special Collaboration event in August. The following Title Update, which has yet to be detailed, will launch in September.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-wont-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-won%E2%80%99t-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter.1229844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 may be a sequel, but it's definitely doing some things differently than its predecessor. One of those things is the ability for players to 'respec', that is to say, to change their allocation of perks, traits, and whatnot. The first game supported that, but the new game director Brandon Adler, who did not work on the original The Outer Worlds (but has credits in Obsidian RPGs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and Avowed), has a different view on the matter. Speaking to RPG Site, he <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>We don't allow respec. Lots of people love respec… that is definitely one way you can go about things. I personally want the player to understand their choices are permanent – they matter – and then they think more about their choices. There's a lot of times where you'll see games where they allow infinite respec, and at that point I'm not really role-playing a character, because I'm jumping between -- well my guy is a really great assassin that snipes from long range, and then oh, y'know, now I'm going to be a speech person, then respec again.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, it's not wrong that people like to play like that. But I just like to make sure... Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely an interesting view. I can see where he's coming from, although others will be disappointed by the lack of flexibility when building their new character. However, you are still allowed a bit of experimentation in the beginning, as you can still respect while in the tutorial area.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X and will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>
