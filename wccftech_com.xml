			<p>The top-down action RPG No Rest for the Wicked could skip Xbox, at least at first, as suggested by Moon Studios founder and Game Director Thomas Mahler. While chatting in the game's official Discord channel, he <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>By the way, given current market conditions, we might only release on PlayStation 5 and potentially Nintendo Switch 2 for the time being. We'll have to discuss things with Microsoft to see what makes sense for Xbox.</em></p>



<p>Later, Mahler commented on X that it's not official yet, but supporting PlayStation 5 first and foremost is just common business sense at this point.</p>



<p><em>There’s nothing to officially confirm yet. We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately, we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!</em></p>



<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in the second half of April 2024 on PC as an early access title. At first, it was published by Private Division, but Moon Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased</a> the publishing rights back earlier this year.</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the Austrian developer (primarily known for the Ori franchise) wasn't exactly doing very well, with Mahler asking fans to leave a positive review on Steam for No Rest for the Wicked to counterbalance some review bombing. That may be why they are prioritizing the most lucrative platforms for the console ports.</p>



<p>Indeed, Xbox doesn't have nearly as large a user base as the PlayStation 5 (or the Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, if it continues selling at this rate). The hardware sales of Microsoft's consoles have continued dwindling as the first-party games are now available not only on PC but even on other consoles, and third-party developers find it increasingly hard to spend resources on Xbox versions, unless there is a Game Pass deal involved - which is not the case so far with No Rest for the Wicked.</p>



<p>It is, however, ironic that a developer whose best-known franchise, Ori, made its fortune on Xbox, is now essentially forced to put the platform after others.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fable Rumored to Be Missing 2026 Launch Window, Too]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In late February, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to fans that Fable would be missing its 2025 launch window. He did so while reassuring them with a new, gorgeous Pre-Alpha gameplay video that promised everything was in order except for the additional polish required before shipping the game.</p>



<p>However, according to insider Shpeshal Nick, there's a chance Fable might miss 2026, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gB3q8GursaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast</a>, he relayed information from two sources that suggested a delay is not out of the question:</p>



<p><em>I don't think Fable's next year. My information is that it's not going to be 2026. I've heard it from two different people now that Fable may slip to 2027. And that's not doom and gloom, oh, there's something wrong with the game. Problems. Just hearing that it's taking a little bit longer than they expected.<br>It's not about agreeing or disagreeing, I've had two different people tell me. One of them wasn't from Microsoft. I'm hearing that it's probably going to slip to 2027. Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware of what will probably happen now. Someone from Playground will probably come out and go, "No, no, it's next year."</em></p>



<p>While Shpeshal Nick got a few Xbox rumors right before, he doesn't exactly have a spotless record, either. As such, take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>If it turned out to be the case, though, it would be another blow to Microsoft's reputation. Fans are already disgruntled after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot and the ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG, not to mention the related layoffs. Moreover, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the twenty-fifth anniversary of Xbox, due to take place next year, would be celebrated with the return of several historic franchises, including Fable, Forza, Gears of War, and another that might be Halo.</p>



<p>Going back on that promise wouldn't work in Microsoft's favor. At the same time, rushing a game that is not ready wouldn't be great, either. But Playground Games has reportedly been working on the game for around eight years now, and while it is understandable that it would take them a while to get a grip on the action RPG genre (they only ever did racing games before), making that a full ten years to 2027 would be too much. They even got help from Eidos Montréal, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2024, although a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> from the Canadian studio suggests their part of the work on Fable might have been completed.</p>



<p>Even without Fable, Microsoft could still have a decent first-party lineup in 2026 between Clockwork Revolution, the new Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Halo: Combat Evolved remake</a>, not to mention what Bethesda and Activision Blizzard may have in store for next year. Even so, it would be another blow for the Xbox division in the eyes of fans.</p>



<p>We'll update this story if anyone from Playground Games and/or Microsoft wishes to comment on the rumor.</p>

			<p>Nacon has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/538859942242681786?l=english">announced</a> the Year 2 roadmap for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, detailing the highlights that will be a part of each season, including this week's Season 4, all the way up to Season 8, which will debut in July 2026. </p>



<p>KT Racing and Nacon put together an hour-long developer update that digs into what's to come, along with a short retrospective on how things have gone since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> launched last September.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting with what's to come in the short term, Season 4 is launching this coming Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and with it five new cars, new content like Casino, a new currency for players to earn called Diamonds, and other enhancements to the game. </p>



<p>There's also a key community feature that's live from now until August 4, 2025, which is that players will be able to vote on which new mission type will be added to Solar Crown. Detective, Delivery, Photography, and Adrenaline are the four types players can choose from, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">you can submit your vote until August 4th at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Season 5 will arrive in October of this year, which is also when Year 2 will officially kick off. That's when taxi missions will be making their return, and when a new online store will be introduced. There will also be re-balances to the in-game economy, new vehicles, and a bevy of performance and graphical boosts that'll be directly from the KT Engine getting its own upgrade. </p>



<p>Season 6 kicks off January 2026, and it's also when the mission players voted for will be added to the game, among the other usual features like new cars and improvements to the game.</p>



<p>Season 7 arrives in April 2026, bringing along with it the introduction of Official Racing Centers, dedicated racing venues for Hong Kong Island and Ibiza City, and a revamping of live events and the premium Solar Pass. Finally, Season 8 arrives as previously mentioned in July 2026, which will be highlighted by the return of Housing and Real Estate, two elements missing from Solar Crown that players loved in the first two Test Drive Unlimited games. It'll also add Extreme missions and Passenger mode, along with the rest of the usual suspects. </p>



<p>Beyond Season 8, Nacon and KT Racing are committed to continuing to update and improve Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, as the team is already considering adding elements like bikes and yachts.</p>
