<p><strong>Sony</strong> hasn't officially announced the <strong>PlayStation 6</strong> yet, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning out an increasingly steady stream of leaks, insider reports, and solid hints from the company itself. With the PlayStation 5 well into the latter half of its lifecycle and the PS5 Pro already on shelves, <strong>the attention of hardcore gamers is increasingly turning toward whatever comes next</strong>. </p>



<p>Here is everything we know so far about the PlayStation 6, from its release window and hardware to pricing, design, and <strong>the possibility of an entirely new PlayStation handheld</strong> launching alongside it. Read this article <strong>with the significant caveat that most of this info is likely still in flux and may not even have been finalized by Sony itself yet</strong>. We'll continue updating this article up to the console's release whenever significant new information becomes available.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Release Date and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Sony has maintained a remarkably consistent console release cadence: the PS3 launched in 2006, the PS4 in 2013, and the PS5 in November 2020, a seemingly near-perfect seven-year gap each time. Applying that pattern to the PS5 points to a <strong>2027 release window</strong> for the PS6, and that was the most widely cited target among leakers, chiefly YouTuber <strong>Moore's Law Is Dead</strong> (<strong>MLID</strong>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renowned AMD insider <strong>KeplerL2</strong></a>. However, in January 2026, <strong>MST International</strong> senior analyst <strong>David Gibson</strong> warned that while Sony's existing memory inventory would shield it from the short-term impact of <strong>rising RAM prices</strong>, increased costs could become a serious issue in the fiscal year ending March 2027, and noted that the PS6's release is therefore "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely to be delayed longer than many expected</a></strong>." </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Then, on February 15, 2026, Bloomberg published an even more alarming report citing anonymous sources familiar with Sony's PlayStation 6 plans. The report stated that Sony is now "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029</a></strong>", still largely due to the ongoing memory shortage that has no end in sight. If true, this could mark the longest gap between PlayStation consoles to date, while also <strong>giving Microsoft a chance to capitalize on with its next Xbox console</strong>, which is still reportedly targeting a l<strong>ate 2027 release window</strong>. </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Pricing is one of the most uncertain aspects of the already still nebulous PS6 picture, and the RAM shortage has complicated things further. The PS5 launched at <strong>$499</strong> for the standard edition, but with rising production costs, <strong>the PS6 is highly unlikely to match that price point</strong>. Most estimates from credible sources currently place the PS6 <strong>between $500 and $600</strong>, though some industry observers have pushed that estimate <strong>as high as $700–$900</strong> depending on the memory situation and model configuration. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro's <strong>$699</strong> launch price</a> in 2024 may have been responsible for setting a new psychological ceiling for PlayStation hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-hardware-specifications">Hardware Specifications</h2>



<p id="h-hardware-specifications">Sony's continued partnership with <strong>AMD</strong> since the days of the PS4 is one of the few hardware details confirmed with high confidence. Reuters reported in September 2024 that Intel had lost out on a bid to design the PS6 chipset back in 2022, with AMD winning the contract. <strong>This makes sense from a backward-compatibility standpoint</strong>, since the PS5 and PS5 Pro are both built on custom AMD silicon.</p>



<p>Leaked specifications, primarily from the aforementioned leaks shared by MLID and Kepler_L2, point to a custom APU featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing node</strong>: <strong>TSMC N2</strong> (2nm), delivering substantial efficiency gains over the PS5's 7nm process.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD <strong>Zen 6</strong> architecture, offering a substantial leap from the Zen 2 found in both the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which should dramatically reduce the CPU bottleneck issues seen in demanding titles.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: It is expected that the PS6 will feature <strong>GDDR7 RAM</strong> offering approximately <strong>640 GB/s bandwidth</strong>, which would be <strong>a 43% increase over the PS5's 448 GB/s</strong>, though using a narrower 160-bit memory bus rather than the PS5's 256-bit bus, with the speed difference compensating for the reduced bus width. Total RAM capacity has not been reliably leaked yet.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: AMD's next-generation <strong>RDNA 5</strong> GPU architecture, which will be used by both PS6 and the next Xbox. Though, according to KeplerL2, the new PlayStation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-wont-include-full-amd-rdna-5-feature-set/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't feature the full RDNA 5 feature set</a></strong> that will be available on desktop graphics cards.</li>



<li><strong>Rasterization Performance</strong>: Multiple leaks from MLID and KeplerL2 <span>indicate roughly&nbsp;<strong>three times the rasterization performance of the base PS5</strong>, with the teraflop count rising from <strong>10.28 TFlops</strong> for the PS5 (and <strong>18.05 TFlops</strong> for</span> the PS5 Pro) to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34-40 TFlops</a></strong> for the PS6.</li>



<li><strong>Ray Tracing Performance</strong>: This is supposedly the big focus of the PlayStation 6 console. Thanks to the advancements planned for RDNA 5, <strong>ray tracing performance could increase by a massive 6-12x compared to the PlayStation 5</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of those advancements were actually co-developed by AMD and Sony through the so-called <strong>Project Amethyst, a machine learning-focused</strong> initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally announced in late 2024</a>, Project Amethyst <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a major update in October 2025</a>, when AMD unveiled three key technologies that PlayStation 6 System Architect <strong>Mark Cerny</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mark-cerny-project-amethyst-collaboration-amd-is-a-step-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically confirmed will be in the new console</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Neural Arrays</strong>: A new approach to grouping GPU compute units so they can work together as a single AI engine, enabling better upscaling and denoising at lower cost to GPU performance. This was described as a fundamental improvement to technologies like Sony's PSSR.</li>



<li><strong>Radiance Cores</strong>: A new dedicated hardware block designed for ray and path tracing, taking full control of ray traversal (one of the most compute-heavy tasks currently handled inefficiently across shared resources) and freeing the GPU's shader cores for their primary functions. Cerny noted: <em>"There's a significant speed boost that comes from putting the traversal logic in hardware, and a further boost that comes from that hardware operating independently from the shader cores."</em></li>



<li><strong>Universal Compression</strong>: A software layer that compresses data of all types (not just specific file formats, as in current solutions) as it flows through the graphics pipeline, effectively boosting available memory bandwidth. AMD's <strong>Jack Huynh</strong>, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics Group, described memory bandwidth limitations as a key barrier to next-gen rendering techniques, and Universal Compression is intended to address that without requiring an expensive hardware memory upgrade.</li>
</ul>



<p>There's no info yet on the storage. On the connectivity side, support for the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-forum-releases-hdmi-2-2-specification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDMI 2.2 specification</a></strong> (which allows resolutions up to 10K at 120Hz, 4K at up to 480Hz, and 8K at up to 240Hz) and <strong>USB4 Version 2.0</strong> seem like a given, especially if the delay rumors turn out to be correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-handheld-project-canis">PlayStation 6 Handheld: Project "Canis"</h2>



<p>One of the most unexpected elements of the PlayStation 6 conversation is the strong rumor that <strong>Sony is planning to launch a dedicated gaming handheld</strong> alongside, or shortly after, the PS6 home console. This would be quite the surprise for PlayStation handheld fans, who had almost given up on the idea of a new handheld console after the resounding failure of the PS Vita.</p>



<p>Bloomberg first reported in 2024 that Sony was exploring a gaming handheld, internally dubbed <strong>"Project Canis."</strong> Since then, leaked AMD documentation uncovered by MLID <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>has added substantial hardware detail</strong></a>, and multiple leakers have corroborated the device's existence. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has also updated its PS5 developer kits to prioritize "<strong>Low Power Mode</strong>" support</a>, with documentation suggesting developers ensure their games can run on just eight CPU threads. Multiple sources have since interpreted this as <strong>Sony quietly preparing the software ecosystem for handheld hardware</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Project Canis Tentative Specs </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chip</strong>: Monolithic APU built on TSMC 3nm of approximately 135mm².</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 4x Zen 6c cores for games + 2x low-power Zen 6 cores dedicated to the OS. The OS offload reportedly frees roughly 20% additional CPU headroom for games.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: 16 RDNA 5 compute units, clocking around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and 1.65 GHz when docked.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: LPDDR5X on a 192-bit controller, with theoretical support for up to 48GB; no solid figure has been confirmed, though developers consulted on the matter suggested anything between 24 –36GB would be necessary to run next-gen games with features such as UE5's Nanite.</li>



<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Roughly half the raw rasterization power of the base PS5, but with notably stronger ray tracing performance due to the RDNA 5 architectural improvements. Docked rasterization performance could be around 0.55 – 0.75× PS5, while ray tracing could land at 1.3 – 2.6× PS5 thanks to RDNA 5's efficiency gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some PlayStation gamers have worried that the handheld could "hold back" new PlayStation 6 games, but  according to Massive Damage's Art Director Bryan Heemskerk, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-held-back-pc-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6 games are more likely to be held back by PC ports</a></strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-games">PlayStation 6 Games</h2>



<p>This is by far the most speculative paragraph of the whole article, at least at the time of the original publication, for a very simple reason: it's way too early, and <strong>no PS6 games have been formally announced yet</strong>. That said, we can make a few educated guesses based on the known development timelines.</p>



<p>First in line would obviously be <strong>Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet</strong>, <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>'s new sci-fi IP. It's been a long time since we got a new game from the studio (<strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> launched in June 2020), and that's largely because Naughty Dog famously <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled The Last of Us Online in December 2023</a></strong> because it didn't want to become bound to the live service development cycle. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027</a></strong>, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier. It will definitely launch on PlayStation 5, but it could be a prime candidate for a PS6 version when the PlayStation 6 eventually hits the market.</p>



<p>The same goes for most of the big games that are tentatively scheduled for 2027-2028:</p>



<ul>
<li>Creative Assembly's <strong>Alien Isolation sequel</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong></li>



<li>Cloud Chamber's <strong>BioShock 4</strong></li>



<li>Larian's <strong>Divinity</strong></li>



<li>Bethesda's <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong></li>



<li>Square Enix's <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Avalanche Software's <strong>Hogwarts Legacy 2</strong></li>



<li>4A Games' <strong>Metro Exodus sequel</strong></li>



<li>Respawn's <strong>Star Wars Jedi Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Remake</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's The Division 3</strong></li>



<li>Saber's <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher IV</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's + Fool Theory's <strong>The Witcher Remake</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>All these games will likely be cross-generation, offering a PlayStation 6 version with additional bells and whistles at some point. The cross-gen phenomenon <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was already huge between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a></strong>, and given current industry trends, it's only going to get larger.</p>



<p>As for true PS6-only titles, it will take a very long time for those. Maybe the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Mass Effect</a></strong>, the freshly announced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-will-launch-before-2030-promises-casey-hudson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War remake trilogy</a></strong> will qualify. Needless to say, we'll slowly update this section (as with the others) once more concrete details become available. Stay tuned.</p>
