			<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the new sci-fi intellectual property in development at Naughty Dog, won't be released before 2027. The comment was prompted by CD Projekt RED's confirmation to investors that The Witcher IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn't launch before the end of 2026</a>.</p>
<p>On the ResetEra forum, users recalled that Schreier had talked about both games (which were shown for the first time at The Game Awards 2024 in December) as being quite early in the development phase and relatively far from launch. Schreier himself then chimed in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/post-137487981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new post</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm pretty sure I said they were both going to be very early teases. Neither of those games will be out next year.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, while we didn't have any dates for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Game Director Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that fans would have to wait quite some time:</p>
<p><em>We still have a ways to go, but I'm kind of very excited to see... Again, these things are so complex and big and there's so many people involved. It's like, I still don't know exactly what this thing's gonna look like at the end. It's like, I have a theory, I have an idea, but it's still evolving and changing as we are making it.</em></p>
<p>If Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet launched in 2027, it would be seven years since the launch of Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us Part II. That's a very long time between releases, but it should be noted that Naughty Dog had nearly completed The Last of Us Online before deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancel it</a> after they realized (with Bungie's input) that the game's post-launch support would have absorbed much of the studio's efforts for years to come. It is quite likely that if The Last of Us Online was not canceled, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would have been postponed even further away.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Witcher IV will also be the studio's next full game release after Cyberpunk 2077's late 2020 debut. CD Projekt RED did not cancel a game in between, but they were busy improving Cyberpunk 2077 and releasing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Moreover, the studio has transitioned from its in-house RED Engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say there are reasons why these games are taking so long. Nonetheless, it's becoming apparent that the largest triple-A games can now take between five and seven years to complete, which makes it all the more challenging to invest in them, as failure would be catastrophic to a studio after spending so much time and resources.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-cap-can-be-removed-with-new-version-of-special-k-mod-1-0-1-patch-released-to-address-%E2%80%9Cvarious%E2%80%9D-issues.1145085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-uncapped-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new version of the popular Special K mod improves Assassin's Creed Shadows on PC by fixing multiple issues and introducing an option to uncap cutscenes' framerate.</p>
<p>Shortly after the release of the latest entry in the series, Special K creator Kaldaien released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3159330/discussions/0/612032512885050246/">a new version of the mod</a>, which includes an option to uncap cutscenes framerate and addresses several issues found in the PC version of the game, which includes NVIDIA DLSS options mysteriously becoming unavailable and broken NVIDIA Reflex integration.</p>
<p>The new version of the Special K mod introducing the fixes highlighted above is also fully compatible with the Assassin's Creed Shadows latest patch, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1jjlifk/ac_shadows_title_update_101_hot_fix_release_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch 1.0.1</a>, which was released today. Unfortunately, the patch doesn't bring any major changes to the game, as it only fixes some unspecified global issues and a Photo mode issue that could cause a crash when fetching photos to display on the game's world map.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is far from being among the best open-world role-playing games released to date, but it's still a solid entry in the Ubisoft series, bringing back a focus on stealth gameplay without doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-monster-hunter-wilds-bug-is-sweet-revenge-for-those-stuck-at-30-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has some<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"> widely reported technical issues</a> that impact the game's performance considerably, but you should consider yourself lucky if you cannot run the game at a high framerate thanks to a bug that actually increases damage dealt by multi-hit attacks the lower the framerate is.</p>
<p>A video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Antawoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Anta</a> a few days ago showcases how multi-hit moves in the latest entry in the series actually deal more damage under certain conditions when the game runs at 30 FPS, the lower possible framerate cap available on PC. This is caused by framerate tied to game logic, which isn't something new for the series, as Monster Hunter Rise, for example, was also affected by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-challenging-high-framerates/">a similar issue</a> that made the game harder when running at higher than 30 FPS, which really seems to be the ideal framerate for the series' developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Monster Hunter Wilds] This bug is stealing your damage - Here's how to fix it" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB3e1zYpuqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After watching the video above, I launched Monster Hunter Wilds and did a quick test using a Great Sword and the Training Area dummy, which confirmed the bug described by Anta occurs very frequently. The Total Damage seen in the screenshot below was dealt with the game running with a 30 FPS cap, while the Previous Total with a 120 FPS cap. While there are ways to mitigate the issue, as highlighted in the video, they are far from ideal, so hopefully, the issue will be addressed with a future update.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first major update will launch next week on all formats, introducing new features to the game as well as High Rank Zoh Shia and returning monster Mizustune.

			<p>It looks like Microsoft's big decision to switch to a multiplatform policy could start paying dividends soon if the PlayStation Store pre-order charts are to be believed. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-topping-the-pre-order-charts-on-the-playstation-store-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-forza-horizon-5.1144932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX, two games that are due to launch in April, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5, are taking the top spots across various countries with their various editions.</p>
<p><em><strong>United States</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #14</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #5, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #17</em></p>
<p><em><strong>France</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #3, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #2, #11</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Italy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #3</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #5, #22</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #2, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #3, #13</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Portugal</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #3, #11</em></p>
<p>It seems like PlayStation users are eager to get their hands on two of the best Microsoft games released in the past few years. Forza Horizon 5 might be the most surprising since it's now nearly four years old. Still, it's arguably the finest open world racing game ever made, having won several Game of the Year awards in 2021. Here on Wccftech, the game earned a 9.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wray's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let's keep it simple. Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game. It's outstanding, and I can unashamedly say that if it's not my favorite, it's in my top five games of the year. I recommend it for anybody and everybody.</em></p>
<p>When the game launches on PS5 on April 29, all users in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40-million-strong community</a> will be able to access the new Horizon Realms update that allows drivers to relive the post-launch Evolving World updates at their leisure.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will debut twelve days earlier despite being much more recent. Still, it's just every bit as great as Forza Horizon 5 in its own genre, as I outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 9/10 review of the PC version</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>It is perhaps a bit ironic that both games will be played best on consoles on Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, but that's entirely on Microsoft for choosing not to make another mid-generation console refresh like they did with the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>Anyway, as The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-more-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a>, this is just the beginning for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch users. Microsoft-owned studios are expected to release many more titles on 'rival' consoles throughout the year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly Bethesda's Starfield</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian's Avowed</a>, and more.</p>
