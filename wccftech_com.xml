			<p>Due to the PlayStation Network outage, Capcom has made the decision to extend the Open Beta Test by a full 24 hours across all platforms. The PlayStation Network outage occurred during the first weekend of the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test. Specifically, it happened on February 8, and as a result, millions of gamers were left without a way to play their games. This caused players to be locked out of all online services, even their single-player games, if they happened to own them digitally. While players who had them on the disc would be able to play, it would only be the case if the data of the game was already on the PlayStation and did not need to be installed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sony didn't really give much of a <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reason</a> as to why the network was down for so long, but blamed the outage on an "operational issue." Luckily, it sounds as if it was just an internal error rather than the network being hacked from the outside and causing major data breaches across the board.</p>
<p>As a result of the network outage, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 will resume today at 7 PM PST / 10 PM ET / 3 AM GMT and will continue until February 17 at 6:59 PM PST / 9:59 PM ET / 2:59 AM GMT.</p>
<p>As the Open Beta Test takes place, players will be able to unlock the participation bonus that will become available in the full version of the game, which is set to release on February 28 on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether this game will run on your PC, Capcom has released a Benchmark for you to utilize, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-free-benchmark-and-updated-pc-requirements/">full specification requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Like the original beta, Open Beta Test 2 will include a character creator, where the data can then be transferred into the full game. It will also include a story mission and free-roaming hunts with cross-platform multiplayer. Compared to the first Beta Test, this one comes with additional content, such as fighting the Gypceros and the flagship monster of the game, Arkveld.</p>
<p>Alongside those new features, the Training Area and online features such as Private Lobbies and Online Single Player mode are also included in this upcoming Beta Test.</p>
<p>Although it's been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced by the Monster Hunter developers</a>, the performance and balance adjustments will not be available in this beta build; instead, the developers are instead focused on implementing these changes in the full release of the game.</p>
<p>Will you be participating in the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>Announced during yesterday's State of Play, Hell is Us was announced to get an official release date of September 4, 2025. This title comes from Rogue Factor, a company that made Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned. This new ambitious title will be developed by Rogue Factor and then <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/hell-is-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Nacon</a>. If this game is something that you want to delve into, pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will follow suit in the next coming days for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iZbNIAM8eQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game was previously announced in 2022, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">15-minute extended gameplay video</a> being released during a State of Play in September last year. In this video, viewers were introduced to the dark world of Hell is Us, where you'd have to explore a war-torn country, going on an investigative journey to uncover the past, as well as confronting the ongoing chaos through the country.</p>
<p>This new trailer introduces viewers to the main character Rémi, who is voiced by Elias Toufexis (Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Assassin's Creed, Starfield) in the English language version of the game.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell is Us. I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character and the events that have shaped his personality," says Elias Toufexis. "The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure game where you rely on melee combat for your main method of attack, with a heavy focus on player-incentivized exploration and a captivating story. Instead of being given markers to show them the way, players are encouraged to follow their instincts. This methodology is being used as an homage and return to the roots of adventure games from the 90s, where hand-holding in video games was very minimal.</p>
<p>You play as Rémi, a protagonist who is on an investigative journey to find who he was in a country that was torn apart by civil war. Along the way, he'll find supernatural creatures that are reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments that were found in the region.</p>
<p>Along with the Standard Edition of the game, there will also be a Deluxe Edition that you can purchase, giving you some in-game goods. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell is Us</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for Rémi</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for The Drone</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Secret Code for in-game bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you pre-order the game, you will be rewarded with a Military Pack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, you'll get 72-hour early access to the title.</p>
