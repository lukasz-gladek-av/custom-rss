			<p>With the main <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> showcase event only hours away at the time of this writing, it's no surprise that some of the announcements are beginning to leak out early, like the launch trailer for the Lies Of P DLC expansion, Overture, appearing online, spoiling the surprise that it is going to be shadow-dropped this weekend.</p>
<p>There's some debate as to when the trailer will be shown, whether it's at tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase, or during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox showcase</a> on Sunday, but based on the images and videos that have leaked on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lies-of-p-dlc-will-be-shadowdropped-this-week.1209165/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544">X</a>, it's clear that it will be shadow-dropped, whenever the reveal does show up.</p>
<p>Even with this news leaking online, it's not the biggest surprise that Lies of P: Overture would be out this weekend. As recently as last week, it was rumored to arrive for the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and well before that, we knew it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/">arrive sometime this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of waiting to see where the trailer shows up. The leaked trailer only highlights Xbox platforms at the end, and begins with the Xbox logo, which makes it seem like it'll appear on Sunday. It wouldn't be the first time that the DLC has <a href="https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/">appeared at an Xbox show</a>.</p>
<p>If it does show up during Xbox's showcase, then it is also potentially the second announcement from Xbox's show to have leaked earlier, with rumors circulating that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/">Persona 4 Remake</a> will be officially announced on Sunday as well.</p>
