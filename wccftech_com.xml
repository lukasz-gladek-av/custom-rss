			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> is a new third-person extraction shooter from <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the same team that brought you the fast-paced FPS <strong>The Finals</strong>. ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">intended to be Embark's debut game</a> before the team decided <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">to rework it entirely</a> and focus on The Finals first, a bet that seemingly paid off now that ARC Raiders is <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">one of the most popular games on the market today since it arrived in October 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders will be familiar to extraction shooter fans, while still accessible for those new to the genre.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you've played an extraction shooter before, the core concepts of ARC Raiders will be familiar to you. You jump into a large, expansive map, scavenge for resources and materials, raid and take down enemy players, and extract back to Speranza, the underground city you and every other raider call home.</p>



<p>Beyond enemy players, you'll also have to be wary of ARCs, the hostile machines that are the cause of the dystopian nature of the world. There are several different kinds of ARCs, and you can find out more about them below in the 'Know Your ARCs' section.</p>



<p>You can also find out more about ARCs and the gameplay in ARC Raiders in our upcoming Tips and Tricks, First 5 Things to Do, and Most Annoying ARCs - And How to Deal With Them guides.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll hit the character creation screen after you complete the tutorial.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first log into ARC Raiders, you'll go through a short tutorial that shows you a couple of gameplay basics, like how to move, shoot, breach doors, and search for resources. It's all very basic and seems to end very abruptly with one major lesson: you have to be aware of other Raiders. You learn this lesson when two unknown Raiders catch you by surprise, though, unlike in a regular match, because this is just the tutorial, you wake up after the screen fades to black and fades back in, and the tutorial continues.</p>



<p>From there, you continue until you reach an exit elevator and make your first trip to Speranza, the underground city that becomes your home. You'll be given what looks like a storage closet as your place to live, which you'll slowly build out into your ultimate post-apocalyptic home, and meet the first of the vendors you'll get quests and buy resources from.</p>

<h2 id="h-building-your-raider">Building Your Raider</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Upgrading your stats and your gear is key to buildcrafting in ARC Raiders.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating the aesthetic of your character is, of course, a key part of the experience in any game. But what's really going to impact you in gameplay is your stats and what you take with you when you go up top. </p>



<p>You don't want to take anything with you that you would really regret losing, and you can't just keep rolling the dice with free loadouts. You need to figure out how to put a build together, particularly with where you put your early stats and what weapons you put stock in. </p>

<h2 id="h-speranza-overview">Speranza Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You've got to know how to navigate Speranza.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speranza is your home base of operations in ARC Raiders. It's where you look at and upgrade your Raider's stats, change your loadout, your outfit - it's where you do everything.</p>



<p>You cycle through the main lobby screen, your Workshop, your Raider, the Traders, Decks, and the in-game Store with the left and right bumpers. Your inventory, however, is always available on its own dedicated button. If you don't know what that button is, look to the bottom left of your screen.</p>



<p>When you're in your inventory menu, make sure to pay attention to the '<strong>Actions'</strong> button. That's where you'll be able to decide on what to do with everything you find and store in your <strong>Stash</strong>. You also need to pay close attention to a small '<strong>Expand</strong>' option that sits just above your inventory stack. That's where you upgrade your Stash, so it can hold more things.</p>

<h2 id="h-going-topside-and-coming-home">Going Topside and Coming Home</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Going up is only half the job, you have to come home safely too.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, you can't upgrade your Raider, your gear, build out your home in Speranza; you can't do anything, if you can't survive a raid. Once you choose where to go, when you arrive you'll have approximately 30 minutes to grab what you can and make it back to an elevator to reach Speranza safely.</p>



<p>Each map will have multiple options for elevators or other ways back home, but they won't all be open to you for the whole match. One will remain available the entire time, but if you want the safest route home, you'll need to make it to an elevator in time.</p>

<p>You should always be on the lookout for other players. Even with the reputation ARC Raiders has gained where plenty of players choose to play a more passive, PvE style, they're technically always a danger. But ARCs, the robots that stalk every inch of the map, those are the biggest danger of all.</p>



<p>That's why it's important to know your enemy; not just how to defeat it, but how to avoid it, and how to ensure you're always making it back home.</p>

			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>
