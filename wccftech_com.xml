			<p>Today, Funcom confirmed that there will be an official Dune: Awakening live stream on Wednesday, May 28, at 6 PM CEST via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Funcom/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> to discuss the game's mid-to-endgame. The Norwegian developer has promised that there will be plenty to do for PvE and PvP players alike, but the specifics will be unveiled next week.</p>
<p>For now, we know that players will form clans and then affiliate themselves with either the Atreides or the Harkonnen Great Houses. They will compete against one another mainly in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Desert PvP map</a>, which is said to be absolutely gigantic in size (around 500 square kilometers, according to Funcom Game Director Joel Bylos) and capable of hosting hundreds of players simultaneously. The map will be refreshed each week (the lore explanation for it being the Coriolis sandstorms) to provide continuously interesting points of interest to explore. The ultimate goal is, of course, to harvest Spice, but there's also the mostly hazy Landsraad politics system where players will be able to vote on things that could impact the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Thank You for Playing the Beta Weekend" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_TgFDrLM7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many thousands of players recently tried the early game during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closed Beta Test weekend</a>. This part of Dune: Awakening consisted of 20-25 hours, or 25% of the Hagga Basin map, so it only scratched the surface of what players will find in the massive survival multiplayer game. Even in this brief time and limited content, players amassed some impressive numbers in the beta. There were 107K deaths by Shai-Hulud (the sandworm), while 214K vehicles were crafted to aid players in moving throughout the desert. Nearly 10 million scavenger enemies were killed; 151K liters of water were consumed; 8.7 million liters of blood were extracted from defeated foes; 10K vehicles were lost in sandstorms, and more than 65K players withered away in the sun, dying from exposure to the deadly elements of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>. Pre-order customers who purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition can start playing on June 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>April 2025 was another Xbox-focused month on the sales charts and the active player numbers charts, with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered ranking as the best-selling game on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and Call of Duty leading monthly active users on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>The latest monthly data comes from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo3w2xuc2e">Circana</a> executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who posts some of the charting information Circana collects each month.</p>
<p>Five of the top 10 best-selling games for April 2025 were Xbox games, and three of those five were all in the top-five best-selling games for the month, with Oblivion Remastered at the top, followed by Forza Horizon 5 in the number two spot, and Minecraft at the number four spot. The other Xbox games in the top-10 were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered has also already become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">third-best-selling game of 2025</a>, trailing only Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows. On PlayStation specifically, four of the top five best-selling games for April 2025 in the US were all Xbox games.</p>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, Microsoft-owned Call of Duty led both Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Oblivion Remastered was the fifth most-played game on Steam, with the number one spot held by Schedule I.</p>
<p>So Xbox and Microsoft are very clearly dominating software sales, though on the hardware side, PlayStation has stayed in the lead, even with hardware spending falling overall compared to the sales in the US for April 2024.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Handheld Will Be Powered by Custom Low-Power APU from AMD – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-will-be-powered-by-custom-low-power-apu-from-amd-%E2%80%93-rumor.1195278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Contrary to what recent findings seemed to suggest, the yet-to-be-officially revealed Xbox handheld will not switch to the ARM architecture, but will be powered by an AMD APU.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/qualcomm-job-posting-suggest-the-next-xbox-will-be-based-on-arm.1684130/post-270428048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, known AMD leaker KeplerL2 commented on the handheld, saying that it will be powered by a custom low-power APU from AMD. The Xbox-branded handhelds, on the other hand, will use whatever APUs are available to OEMs, including Z2E from AMD, Lunar/Panther Lake from Intel, X Elite 2 from Qualcomm, and N1 from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Though it was expected for Microsoft to go with AMD again for its next-generation systems, including the dedicated handheld, which has been teased multiple times in the past, a job ad that surfaced online last week<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-arm/"> suggested</a> that some of the next-gen Xbox products could make the switch to the ARM architecture. This choice could have made sense somewhat for a handheld system, as the ARM architecture provides better power efficiency, but it would have led to issues in terms of compatibility with current software, and not having access to a large part of the Xbox library wouldn't really fit with the current strategy of making Xbox games available on as many devices as possible.</p>
<p>With the Xbox handheld likely far from release, we will get to see the first glimpses of the company's handheld strategy with the aforementioned branded handhelds. The first one, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">Project Kennan</a>, is being developed in collaboration with ASUS, will run Windows, unsurprisingly, and feature an interface reminiscent of the Xbox consoles. This handheld should be released before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018 and was later ported to PC in 2019. While the game was never properly updated for current generation consoles, a new PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch is <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/">reportedly</a> in the works, together with a Nintendo Switch 2 port that could be released before the end of the year. Though unconfirmed, these new releases would definitely help Rockstar Games and Take-Two's release schedule for the second half of the year, especially after Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>

			<p><span>Neowiz recently invited Wccftech out to a private hands-on event alongside other media and content creators at The Paramour Estate in sunny Los Angeles. As part of some of the first opportunities to go play Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s expansion to 2023’s surprising puppetry action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a>, we enjoyed (and suffered) through some of the new content featured in this anticipated expansion and enjoyed a brief respite of tacos and a metal rendition of Feel to cap off the evening.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-qa-its-an-opportunity-for-us-to-really-complete-the-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a> takes the bold approach of making the DLC a prequel to the story, rather than continuing P’s adventure after the credits roll. To access the DLC in the first place was something that Neowiz hadn’t been entirely upfront about, but did seem to tentatively agree about a particular damaged and overgrown stargazer in the Path of the Pilgrim. A loading screen tooltip also advised visiting the Star’s Chrysalis near the Malum District. Whether there’s more to be done to access Overture’s new campaign beyond finishing the game for the first time and returning to that particular golden stargazer still has to be confirmed by Neowiz.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anguished-Guardian-of-the-Ruins-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Our hands-on time with Lies of P: Overture was split up into two sessions of equal length. Our first breakout session centered on the Battle Memories boss fights that are also set to come to the base game for Lies of P in a future patch. In this mode, players can challenge any boss they’ve fought once they finish the story and achieve at least one ending first simply by visiting the Hotel Krat stargazer. These fights are locked to the Legendary Stalker difficulty, but each features five different tiers of difficulty that ramp up the enemy’s strength and stats. Completing a fight on a particular might reward players with something special if the fight is completed in a certain amount of time, although I only saw items like collectible pins being unlocked by finishing a fight on the fifth tier. These pins, by the way, are part of a new cosmetic for Lies of P: Overture where the main character can equip and show off up to three pins on their satchel that otherwise don’t provide a statistical bonus from what I could see.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a second battle mode called Death March where players go through a sort of Boss Rush with multiple fights in tandem with a limited supply of consumable items and resources, but it wasn’t something we were able to check out during our hands-on session.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the Battle Memories mode, we faced off a trio of bosses that highlighted how diverse the enemy types can be in Lies of P: Overture. The very first fight was a puppet and master fight where players have to contend with not just a human-type enemy capable of explosive light magic spells, but also a valkyrie sort of puppet that could attack independently. Players might instinctively move to finish off the puppet first, but all this does is phase the enemy briefly while the main boss revives their puppet and restores their durability to fight once more. The second was a hulking abomination within a dingy sewer whose attacks are just as damaging as they are telegraphed. I found this fight to be much simpler and straightforward than the puppeteer from the first encounter once I got a feel for getting back in the groove of parrying attacks. Sure, it did have an enrage mode during its final 1/3rd of health, but by then I had a good flow to the combat and P’s new Legion Arms definitely helped deal damage while staying a safe arm’s length away.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carnival-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The final boss was a massive chimera hybrid of multiple animal types, crystalline structures, and human-like upper torsos, each with differently wielded weapons that could swing and clear out a dozen meters across in a single slash or explode the ground around P if trying to play more defensively. On top of that, the boss transitioned into a second phase where its attacks got much more vicious in addition to a few beam lasers that would catch me by surprise. Trying to fend off this boss with the new bow weapon was largely ineffective, given the sheer amount of HP this boss had versus the miniscule amount of damage the bow could pull off (a tradeoff from having unlimited arrows and staying out of melee range, I suppose). While I could finish the first two bosses with relative ease on the third of five difficulty levels, I was only able to fend off this final boss on the first and second difficulty levels in the limited amount of time I had.</span></p>
<p><span>The second half of our Lies of P: Overture preview centered on actually diving right into the DLC from when it’s first available. Here, P and Gemini venture into the snowy outskirts of Krat and stumble across the Krat Zoo, seemingly still open to the public. There aren’t any NPCs to interact with during the introductory hours, so who’s to say if we might see the real Alidoro in all his katana-wielding glory later on in the DLC? Instead, it’s a snowy path filled with relatively straight corridors and a few spots off the beaten path for consumables and simple loot leading up to the front gates of Krat Zoo. Not all is as pristine and glamorous as Krat once was, as the wilderness is already filled with blue-blooded Carcass enemies and mutated animals alike. I suspect the Carcass Butcher’s Amulet purchased from Pulcinella in the base game might be one of the best accessories to put on for the DLC, at least in the early moments.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you’re intimately familiar with the flow of Lies of P’s combat and are sufficiently geared up, the enemies in Overture are no joke. Even the basic mindless carcass zombies can knock P down in a few hits and trying to take on two or more from a bad vantage point can leave the player ganged up on. This is another time where I wished the bow was more effective, but instead it seems more used to harass enemies that might have poor pathfinding, or at least could simply not reach the player, rather than trying to engage on even footing. Instead, there were two weapons I gravitated towards the most in Lies of P: Overture’s modest selection of new weapon types. The first was a windmill-looking rotary saw that would actually charge up with stronger attacks if P dashes with the weapon equipped and a large gunblade, where P can fire off explosive shells at the end of combo swings or even propel himself around the arena like a Gunlance user in Monster Hunter. This latter type, much like the Bow and a number of other weapons in the Overture preview, is unique in that they do not have a separate handle and blade, meaning swapping about like you could with nearly every other weapon in Lies of P isn’t an option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even the minibosses that exist like skill checks against the player in order to progress could be a struggle early on in Lies of P: Overture. A hulking gorilla Carcass marked off the front gates to Krat Zoo and existed to make sure the player understood either how to perfectly parry, something I had to retrain my muscle memory after playing more lax titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and The First Berserker: Khazan as Lies of P: Overture features a much tighter parry window, or get used to dodging out of harm’s way. This gorilla was easily the death of me three or four times before I finally persevered, only to realize later on that no, that is simply a regular enemy type who shows up at least more than once in the back portion of the Krat Zoo. There were other vicious Carcass animals throughout Krat Zoo, including a stampeding mammoth, which was surprisingly much easier than either of the gorillas, and a corrupted crocodile, which served as the main boss for this playable section. Regrettably, I was not able to reach in the limited time available. Instead, I focused on exploring the side paths of Krat Zoo and taking a return trip to Hotel Krat to see what had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Z-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>While I couldn’t venture out and see everything I wanted to outside of Hotel Krat, I did get a rough idea about how little has changed outside of the Overture map. Taking a moment to harvest some gold coin fruit or upgrade the weapons I had on me (there was a dragon spear ala Guan Yu’s signature weapon in the item box to try out) instead showed that there were the same rewards and +10 enhancement cap from the base game, although I would think that enhancement cap would be lifted later on in the DLC if the power scaling goes up. The P-Organ system also appeared to feature the same nodes from the original and respeccing still required gold coin fruit, something that seemed obvious given that both respeccing and even venturing into the Overture DLC both required completing the game at least once.</span></p>

<p><span>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</span></p>

			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/">Insider Gaming</a> points to more issues at Cloud Imperium Games, with the studio reportedly losing "<em>integral</em>" staff regarding server meshing and having been hit with more layoffs across all its departments.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming, after Roger Godfrey's departure in December 2024, Ivan Corbett and Jordan Wood have left the studio, leaving no producers at Cloud Imperium Games working on server meshing. Sources Insider Gaming spoke to described all three leaving as a "<em>huge loss</em>" for Cloud Imperium Games.</p>
<p>It's the latest news in what's been a rocky time for Star Citizen and Cloud Imperium Games. Last year, the studio suffered layoffs in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/some-star-citizen-devs-reportedly-laid-off-as-cloud-imperium-restructures/">February</a> and <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/star-citizen-layoffs-funding-release/">November</a> 2024, and just ahead of the November layoff, a separate <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/">report from Insider Gaming</a> described an internal environment where developers are overworked on anything but finishing Star Citizen to launch it out of the early access state it has remained in for its entire existence.</p>
<p>More recently, CIG has come under fire from players for its 'pay-to-win' Flight Blades. Players made their vitriol known to the point where CIG released a statement, admitting that it had "<em>missed a step</em>" with its implementation of Flight Blades, and that in an upcoming June update, players will be able to acquire them through in-game currency instead of just being able to buy them with real money.</p>
<p>"<em>The choice has and should always be yours. If you want to support the project early, you can, but it’s not required. If you own a game package, you’ll be able to pick these up with in-game currency in our next monthly patch. And for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one,</em>" CIG wrote in its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/%%7Breply_id%7D">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks to everyone who’s weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community. Star Citizen wouldn’t exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart.</em>"</p>
<p>Players were not appeased with this though, with many of the comments underneath still calling out the studio, claiming that it was always their plan to get players to buy into Flight Blades through "<em>FOMO</em>" and then offer them as an in-game item later.</p>
<p>It's definitely been a difficult time for CIG, but just how much this will impact Star Citizen remains to be seen. Earlier this year, CIG passed $800 million in crowdfunding for the game, which has been in early access since 2012.</p>
