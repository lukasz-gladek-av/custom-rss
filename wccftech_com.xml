			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has started arriving in stores ahead of next week's launch, as confirmed by pictures making the rounds online.</p>
<p>One of the pictures, which can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pDdR1vP">here</a>, shows the front and back of the system's box, which provides information on the box's content and the system's basic features. Funnily enough, the 8K sticker that was found on the base model's launch box is nowhere to be seen, highlighting how that crazy high resolution is no longer considered a marketing point, even though the system is actually capable of running games at 8K resolution, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a>, unlike the base model.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you need to know more about the PlayStation 5 Pro box, Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20241029053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> posted a hilarious review of it, highlighting how the white hardware and text stand out against the seductive black color of the box and how it has a very PlayStation-like fragrance, and providing a comparison with boxes for previous generation consoles and the base PS5 models. Even with an automated translation, it is still a very entertaining read, so make sure to check it out if you need something to tide you over until the release of the system and the posting of proper reviews of the system.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-dev-diary-shares-details-about-skills-and-modifiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">developer diary</a> for Titan Quest II, those who are excited about the game get to find out more about the Skills and Modifiers that will be available in the game. Players will be given a chance to combine any two masteries to create their own class to help them stand out from the ground and provide them with a unique class. When Early Access begins (which is slated for <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">Winter 2024</a>), players will have access to Earth, Storm, and Warfare masteries. As the game begins to be updated during the Early Access period, there will be more masteries available, providing new and returning players with the opportunity to mix up their class type further and create something new.</p>
<p>In the new Titan Quest II dev diary, players are given a preview into some of the skills that will be available, alongside the modifiers that can drastically change the game for the player. While some of the Modifiers available are passive tweaks that work in the background, some of them are active, and can turn an attack from a sweeping strike into a whirlwind attack, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, players will be able to equip a maximum of 10 skills to the ability bar, allowing for a varied playstyle. This means that you can have a primary damage type and have your other skills be defensive and supportive skills that can provide synergies to your damaging skills. Of course, as previously mentioned, there will be skill trees for players to explore, which helps players decide between active or passive skills and modifiers, which can help bring your character from zero to hero.</p>
<p>In the dev diary that is posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/4445708897933590548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog</a>, there are videos that show examples of how the different masteries work and how the modifiers interact with the different masteries. For example, there is a video that shows off Earth Mastery and how you can use modifiers to create a Lava Fissure skill that produces a line AoE on the floor, dealing strike damage to your enemy, as well as dealing fire damage. Of course, since the skill has been modified, it will cost extra energy. There are also further tweaks you can make, such as the Additional Fissures modifier which reduces your overall damage, but allows you to spawn in extra fissures to cover more ground.</p>

<p>There are plans to showcase more gameplay footage in the future, when more dev diaries are released for Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>Will you be getting this game in the Early Access period? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tower-raid-halloween-run-now-available-in-dying-light-2.1023177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tower-raid-halloween-run-now-available-in-dying-light-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Halloween season has come back around, and players will be able to experience the Tower Raid once more, but with a Halloween twist. In Dying Light 2, players will be able to experience the Tower Raid: Halloween Run event, where there are new levels, weapons, rewards, and a very festive final boss fight for those who manage to climb to the top. For those who want to take part in the event, the Dying Light 2 Tower Raid: Halloween Run will last from October 30 to November 20. This event is available for players right after the prologue, meaning those who are new to the game will be able to get stuck in without having to sit through a ton of missions first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light 2: Stay Human — Tower Raid: Halloween Run" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC56Q9bG_yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The event offers plenty of new rewards, new candies, and the return of Baka, who will be waiting at the Bazaar, offering bounties for you to complete. To celebrate the release of Tower Raid: Halloween Run in Dying Light 2, a trailer has been released. This event will also feature new content for each week that it's available.</p>
<p>For the first week of the event in Dying Light 2, players will be able to get to grips with the new progression system that has been designed specifically for this event, as well as getting their hands on some of the rewards up for grabs. By the second week, players will be able to increase the difficulty level as Elite Mode makes a return to the event, as well as exclusive bounties to participate in. For the third week, you'll be able to unlock daily bounties, which will help contribute to getting your hands on rewards.</p>
<p>As this is a separate event version of Tower Raid, there will be eight floors in total to work through, with a themed boss at the top. Some of the floors are entirely new to the game, with all of them being decorated to fit in with the Halloween theme. To celebrate the festive season, there is also a brand new character system where players will be able to select a role from four options that are available. They each have unique loadouts and traits. The characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarecrow - Two-handed scythe wielder and increased HP pool</li>
<li>Plague - Increased melee damage and stamina with a Plague Cane that utilizes the buffs</li>
<li>Van Aiden - Crossbow and increased ranged damage</li>
<li>Cursed Pirate - Cutlass-wielder with parkour damage perks</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Halloween update, there is a new patch released for Dying Light 2, which adds a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life improvements, as well as new weapons for players to obtain. There will also be a new firearm control layout, which can be activated in the control system. It's been confirmed that there will be future updates to work on making this game a smoother, enhanced experience for the players.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who prefer to find out the patch notes and major updates added to a game via a video format, the development team has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA1Uq6aWyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying 2 Know More</a>, which talks about the Halloween event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/">future plans for the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>
