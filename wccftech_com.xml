			<p>The date today is November 12, 2025, and besides the fact that it is the day after November 11 and before November 13, it's also the 5th anniversary of the release of the PlayStation 5. This past September, on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">30th anniversary of the launch of the original PlayStation console</a>, Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella shared a few interesting sales charts about the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles ever. As a follow-up, he's done the same for the 5th anniversary of the PS5, and the results are fairly similar.</p>



<p>Similar in the sense that when it comes to the best-selling games on the PS5 in the US, Call of Duty appears on the charts three times within the top-five best-selling games on the PS5 since it launched. Piscatella also shared that compared to other PlayStation consoles in the same time span, the PS5 is the 2nd fastest-selling console in the US in PlayStation history, trailing behind the PlayStation 2.</p>







<p>Of the top ten best-selling games on the PS5, three of them are Call of Duty titles, three of them are annualized sports games, and three of them are first-party, PlayStation Studios titles. Two of those games are Insomniac titles, which is arguably more just a result of the fact that Insomniac is one of the few PlayStation Studios teams that has released new games in the last five years, and not just remasters or remakes.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how this list changes, if it does at all, by the end of the PS5 generation. </p>

			<p>Nintendo showcased its special Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct event today, which, ultimately, only confirmed a few things we didn't already know, like how it would've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">a better surprise that Bowser Jr. is in the film if that hadn't leaked ahead of time</a>. That's not to say there wasn't anything worth checking out, since we did get new insight into the plot of this film, and two major new cast members were revealed.</p>



<p>Of course, we also got a new trailer for the film, which showed off more of Illumination's impressive animation work. While the first Super Mario Bros. Movie focused on introducing Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom, the Super Mario Galaxy Movie picks up right where the first one left off, with Bowser still shrunk after eating a shrinking mushroom, and life in the Mushroom Kingdom relatively peaceful.</p>



<p>Enter Bowser Jr., played by Benny Safdie, who you'd recognize from his work in Oppenheimer and Uncut Gems, who is on a quest to save his father from what essentially looks like a small prison he's being kept in, so Mario and Luigi can keep an eye on him.</p>



<p>In a currently unexplained way, Bowser Jr.'s attempted rescue of his dad leads to a galaxy-spanning journey, which is also where Princess Rosalina comes in, played by Marvel star Brie Larson.</p>

<p>Brie Larson's involvement isn't exactly a surprise, considering her outspoken love for Nintendo and involvement in multiple Nintendo Switch commercials. If anything, it's a shock that she wasn't already involved in the first film, and had to wait for the second one to come around to get a role.</p>



<p>Benny Safdie is a more intriguing choice, and from the sounds of it, will be a fun one as he steps into the junior Koopa feet of Bowser Jr., heir to his father's throne.</p>



<p>The trailer also includes a few hints at what's to come, like confirmation that the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey will be one of the locations the film visits on its journey. Hopefully, since this is a galaxy-spanning film, we'll get to see multiple locations from across Super Mario games' history.</p>



<p>In the meantime, there are still a few big questions left unanswered, namely, who is playing Yoshi?</p>
