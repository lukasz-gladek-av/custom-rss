            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware's parent company, Kadokawa, has <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/information/">published its earnings results</a> for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and included in the results is the company's take on the performance of Elden Ring Nightreign, and some insight into future plans for the spin-off title.</p>



<p>We know that Elden Ring Nightreign was one of this year's hit titles because not too long after its launch in May 2025, FromSoftware confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Nightreign had surpassed 5 million copies sold</a>. That's absolutely nothing to scoff at, especially for a multiplayer spin-off title that could have just as easily gone the other way, since many of the people who play FromSoftware games do so for their single-player games.</p>



<p>Now, we know directly from Kadokawa that Elden Ring Nightreign "<em>performed well beyond initial expectations</em>," the company writes in its earnings results. That said, Kadokawa's overall sales from its gaming division decreased compared to last year. As strong as Elden Ring Nightreign's sales were, they were not strong enough to surpass the impact that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree had last year.</p>



<p>"<em>In Gaming, sales decreased despite the domestic and international strong performance of Elden Ring Nightreign, compared to the previous year, which benefited significantly from the contributions of the Elden Ring DLC</em>," writes Kadokawa.</p>



<p>On the slide specifically going over its Gaming segment, under the 'Future Outlook' section, Kadokawa confirms that "<em>FromSoftware is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025)</em>."</p>



<p>It's great to have confirmation that new DLC is in the works. Since Nightreign's launch in May, we've had updates that added <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-tsunami-warning-earthquake/">a new Duos mode to the game</a>, new, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-has-just-become-more-challenging-with-the-introduction-of-the-everdark-sovereigns/">more challenging boss fights,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-mode-out-now/">a whole new difficulty tier</a>, making the game even more difficult if you wanted to increase the challenge further.</p>



<p>However, beyond that, to say its post-launch support has trickled out slowly would be an understatement to several players, many of whom have taken to the game's Steam page to leave negative reviews, specifically citing a lack of post-launch support. </p>



<p>One player who has a little over 166 hours recorded in Nightreign <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198822376274/recommended/2622380/">left a negative review on Steam</a>, writing, "<em>I am a long time FromSoftware fan and I genuinely love Elden Ring Nightreign, but the state of this game is a joke. The post launch support is practically nonexistent. It has been months since release and we got no new boss, no new map, no new characters, no events, nothing. For a game of this scale, that is embarrassing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>My girlfriend and I put many hours into this game at first, but once we finished it there was absolutely no reason to return. The game feels abandoned and the players who supported it from day one are being ignored. The developers need to wake up. If this is the level of effort Nightreign is getting, I truly fear for the future of Duskbloods. At this rate, why should anyone trust or invest in those projects</em>."</p>



<p>With a release window of 'sometime before the end of FY2025' for new Nightreign DLC, though it's good to know that it is on the way, that could mean it doesn't arrive until March 2026, which could very well be too little too late for players like the Steam reviewer above and others.</p>



<p>Of course, we could see the DLC release before the end of this year, which could change things around for Nightreign. If it is set to arrive before the end of 2025, then we might even see it at <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">Sony's State of Play Japan event tomorrow</a>. Otherwise, hopefully, we aren't waiting too long for more Nightreign DLC.</p>

			<p>A new version of The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project is currently in the works and slated for release sometime in 2026. This update aims to further enhance the already improved textures of the game's Next Gen edition.</p>



<p>The upcoming texture overhaul mod was announced with a new trailer shared on YouTube, providing an early comparison between the current textures and the massive improvements coming in the new version.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Modder Halk Hogan, the creator of the project, detailed the extensive list of changes: <em>"You can expect a huge number of improvements in the upcoming HDRP version. Many things that were previously untouched or were just of lower quality will now be significantly better and will complement the beautiful world of The Witcher 3! A lot of additional objects and surfaces will no longer be flat and will receive 3D depth, many textures will be of even better quality, and also various monsters and more animals will be finally reworked."</em></p>



<h2 id="h-a-mod-so-impressive-it-was-officially-implemented">A Mod So Impressive It Was Officially Implemented</h2>



<p>The HD Reworked Project is one of the most impressive texture overhaul mods ever released for the game developed by CD Projekt Red. Over the years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-12-0-ultimate-to-release-on-september-19th/">the project has enhanced the vast majority of the game's textures</a>, improving visuals considerably, especially at high resolutions such as 1440p and 4K on PC.</p>



<p>The quality of work produced by Halk Hogan was deemed so impressive that an older version created for the original 2015 game was officially implemented in the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/">Next-Gen update</a>, allowing console users on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S to enjoy the visual overhaul that PC players had experienced for years.</p>



<p>Still, the official implementation wasn't enough for Halk Hogan, who returned to the project following the Next Gen release to provide even better textures to a game whose visuals continue to shine nearly 10 years after its original launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the span of two months, we went from not knowing anything official about Nintendo's follow-up to its box-office smash-hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">to knowing the official title</a>, (The Super Mario Galaxy Movie), getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-says-movies-are-very-well-suited-to-nintendo-games/">more insight on how Nintendo sees its future adaptations</a>, and a very likely rumor that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">film's first major trailer is days away from premiering</a>.</p>



<p>Today, the latest update comes in the form of an unfortunate leak from a collaboration between Nintendo and Pillsbury cookies. On the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">website for American grocery store chain TopsMarkets</a>, a box of Pillsbury Cookie Dough cookies shaped like Yoshi eggs features a big, bright look at Yoshi in the film on the front of the box.</p>



<p>This is technically our second look at the character design for Yoshi in the film, since the first look came from an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2s-title-may-have-leaked-two-months-ago-in-a-photo-of-deodorant-cans/">Old Spice promotional collaboration</a> that also leaked the film's official title months before it was officially revealed. That said, this is definitely the best look at Yoshi in the coming film we've gotten so far.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What's perhaps the more interesting aspect of this leak is what we see on the back of the box. It's not a full character reveal, but it does practically confirm that one of the new characters in the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be Bowser Jr.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see Bowser Jr.'s classic symbol on the top-left side of the box, which you can bet would not be included if he were not going to be part of the film in some way. So, it would seem that slowly, but surely, we're learning more about this coming sequel all the time.</p>



<p>We should, if the rumors are true, get a brand new trailer sometime before the end of the month, since a new trailer is allegedly slated to appear ahead of the theatrical showings of Wicked: For Good, the part-two to the box-office hit adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>After that, it's a safe bet that the floodgates of pre-release information will open a little wider, as we get closer to the film's April 3, 2026, premiere date.</p>

			<p>Bethesda's next major internal project for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fallout series</strong> is reportedly the long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster, a title that has been a sort of open secret since internal documents leaked in 2023.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ magazine</a>, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard, Bethesda's Director and Executive Producer, discussed the need for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"creative reset"</em>&nbsp;in the</span> The Elder Scrolls and </span>Fallout series. While the next entry in The Elder Scrolls series was formally announced years ago (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">though it is still a long way off</a>), the next Fallout game has yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>Still, the franchise is very much alive. <em>"Hundreds"</em> of people at Bethesda are working on Fallout right now, and some of them are working on "some other things", according to Todd Howard.<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/"> As reported by VGC</a>, one of these other things is a Fallout 3 remaster, similar to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remastered-a-project-long-in-the-works">Fallout 3 Remastered: A Project Long in the Works</h2>



<p>Although a Fallout 3 remaster has never been officially announced, we have known for quite some time that it is in development. In September 2023, files attached to an FTC investigational hearing held remotely with Phil Spencer were leaked online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/"> revealing Bethesda's internal plans from 2020 to 2024</a>. Among the projects listed for a tentative release from April 2024 to March 2025 was a remaster of Fallout 3. </p>



<p>As this scheduled predated the COVID-19 pandemic, plans significantly shifted, and most of the projects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> released later than originall intended, so it's no surprise that even the remaster of the third entry in the post-apcalpytic series has yet to be released.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-coat-of-paint">A New Coat of Paint</h2>



<p>As the Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly similar to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it will likely utilize the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the original engine for gameplay, a trend that has become increasingly common in both remasters and remakes such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-campaign-evolved-comparison-massive-visual-improvements/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. If this is indeed the case, the gameplay of the remaster will be virtually left untouched, which should make those looking for an authentic recreation of the now-classic role-playing game happy.</p>
