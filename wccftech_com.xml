			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been clear about a few things in 2025: that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">development on Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is "<em>coming along really well</em>,"</a> and that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 is an excellent game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/">It's his pick for Game of the Year</a>, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-would-love-to-make-a-aa-game-with-a-similar-scope-to-clair-obscur-expedition-33-thats-really-focused-on-one-area/">GamesRadar</a>, he's gone a step further to say that he "<em>would love</em>" to make a game at the scope and scale of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>The comment came up when Hamaguchi was discussing how with triple-A development, there's so much that goes into a game at that scale. "<em>Whatever direction you look at it, whatever element you take, it's a very high quality</em>."</p>



<p>Smaller, double-A games, however, can be more focused in Hamaguchi's view. They have the ability to "<em>pick one aspect of one element and really push that and...take that to a high level</em>."</p>



<p>It's within that vein that Hamaguchi said that he "<em>would love to try and make a game like that [AA], which is really focused on one area, pushing the boat out, and making that one aspect as fun as possible</em>."</p>



<p>Though he's also clear that this isn't exactly realistic with his current role at Square Enix. Fulfilling his desire to make this smaller-scoped game would only work if he "<em>completely ignored the reality of it - the position I have in the company, what they want me to make, the requirements of my position and that kind of thing</em>."</p>



<p>While Hamaguchi is right, that the idea of him spending his time making a much smaller scoped game within Square Enix is not feasible when you account for all the responsibilities he has and the amount of money Square puts into its games, it would be really interesting to see what he and his teammates at Square Enix could come up with if they were given free reign to make a much more focused, double-A style game. </p>

			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golden-joysticks-ultimate-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-stacked-with-major-indie-titles.1342324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>
