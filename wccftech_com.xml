			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/borderlands-4-everything-we-know-return-og-looter-shooter/">Borderlands 4</a> is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">September 12, 2025</a>, but that's not the date that it'll be arriving on Nintendo Switch 2. Gearbox needs a little bit more time with that version of the game, and today, Gearbox president, Randy Pitchford, announced the separate release date in a video posted to X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though he hams it up as if the Nintendo Switch 2 version won't make it in 2025, the actual launch date for Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 is October 3, 2025, making its release arrive a week and change less than a month from its arrival on other platforms.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I know we promised that the game would come inside of 2025,"</em> Pitchford began<em>. "We promised that it would come before the end of the year, and...game development is very hard.</em> <em>But I do have an update for you, we do have a date now. We have a date for the Nintendo Switch 2 version, of Borderlands 4</em>. <em>You guys, that date...that date is...October 3! It's October 3 you guys! It's not next year, it's not even the holiday, it's so much before Christmas, it's so much before Thanksgiving, it's October 3 you guys, wooo! *horn noise.* I'm psyched, I'm psyched. Get it!</em>"</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the platforms, it'll be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 performs on the Switch 2, and though it's perhaps a bit upsetting for Switch 2 owners that they'll have to wait nearly a month after everyone else can get their hands on Borderlands 4 to play it themselves, they'll at least be able to see the beginnings of whether Gearbox is able to deliver on its promise that the endgame in Borderlands 4 is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-series-best-endgame-yet-gearbox/"> "<em>best endgame</em>"</a> in the series so far.</p>



<p>Especially if the Switch 2 version is somehow more expensive than the other versions of the game. That's not likely to happen, but with all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/">issues that Borderlands 4 has had around pricing</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">Pitchford having to apologize</a> for telling fans that even if it had ended up being $80, they should have found a way to pay it, the last thing this game needs is another pricing controversy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Finally Converted Kevin Feige‚Äôs Son to the Big M]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-finally-converted-kevin-feige%E2%80%99s-son-to-the-big-m.1250190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NetEase's Marvel Rivals accomplished the seemingly impossible by 'converting' none other than the son of Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios and head creative of the incredibly lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, to the Big M. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-feige-marvel-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to The Wrap</a>, Feige said that his son only 'feigned interest in a supportive way' in the movies and TV series and comics until he got his hands on the free-to-play hero shooter game. Afterward, he became interested in learning more about all those characters.</p>



<p><em>Suddenly, he was asking me to tell him more about Hela. Tell him more about The Punisher and these other characters. And then he started seeking them out in the shows.</em></p>



<p>Feige used this as an example of Marvel's struggles when winning over the newer generation. The president of Marvel Studios also underlined the success of the Disney Junior preschool TV series Spidey and His Amazing Friends, which also succeeded in bringing new fans to the superhero universe.</p>



<p>Kevin Feige's son is certainly not the only one whose attention was caught by Marvel Rivals. In February 2025, just two months after its debut, the game had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached</a> over 40 million players globally across the various platforms. The game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-gets-release-date-and-first-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off its third season</a>, featuring Phoenix and Blade as new playable characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Get groovy and suit up with your team featuring the costumes inspired by Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps! </p><p>üî¨ "Today we are your defenders.

</div></figure>



<p>With the imminent theatrical debut of The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Marvel Rivals is well-positioned to gain even greater interest. The Fantastic Four were already introduced in the game back in the first season, but NetEase is now adding new movie-inspired costumes, and even a brand new team-up ability featuring Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm), as shown below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Promises to Deliver on Players‚Äô Demands to ‚ÄúMake Gameplay Better‚Äù in EA Sports FC 26]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-promises-to-deliver-on-players%E2%80%99-demands-to-%E2%80%9Cmake-gameplay-better%E2%80%9D-in-ea-sports-fc-26.1250139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">full gameplay reveal</a> for EA Sports FC 26 last week, EA followed it up with a gameplay deep-dive today.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay deep-dive starts out confident, as EA proclaims that its focus this year has been to respond to a request, or more accurately, a demand from players, to "<em>make gameplay better</em>." The entire gameplay experience is getting an overhaul, and EA promises that this year's gameplay is "<em>responsive, rewarding, and powered by your feedback</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the biggest changes, is that there are now two gameplay presets for players to choose from, Competitive and Authentic mode. Competitive is the preset that'll be attached to the online game modes like Football Ultimate Team and Clubs, and focus more on responsive player movement and player control for a more competitive game feel.</p>



<p>Authentic mode is what you'll be preset to for offline game modes, like manager mode and player career, and lean more towards a realistic gameplay experience. Within these two new presets are also a refinement of gameplay fundamentals like tackling, pace, passing, saves, player physicality, shooting, agility - essentially, every element of gameplay has been touched up, or changed in a significant way.</p>



<p>"<em>Responsiveness, consistency, and control</em>" are the three pillars on which the Competitive gameplay preset is built, while Authentic gameplay is the simulation-style gameplay. While offline and online modes will have their presets, you'll still be able to swap between Competitive and Authentic to suit your preferred gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Regarding the gameplay fundamental changes, EA went through common complaints that players have, and went through what they changed in EA Sports FC 26 to fix the issues players are having. Some examples boiled down to gameplay producer Paul Parsons, who was narrating the video, reading off a complaint before claiming "<em>we made it better</em>" this time around, but it at least represents EA is trying to fix certain pain points with the game that players have been nudging EA to fix for years.</p>



<p>We'll see if EA is actually delivering on these big promises when EA Sports FC 26 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC, on September 26, 2025.</p>

			<p>Wildgate, the PvP shooter that goes between ship-to-ship battle and boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting from Dreamhaven, a team made up of former Blizzard developers is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>The studio debuted a new trailer for the game alongside the launch, which shows off more gameplay and the Sea of Thieves-like gameplay with a sci-fi setting that Wildgate features.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The launch also came with a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530978642895831122?l=english">development blog</a> with patch notes and changes to the game based on feedback from players who had checked it out in open beta format, ahead of the full launch. </p>



<p>The patch notes include changes to player cards, and the introduction of new methods of progression, including an Infamy System, Streaks, and Milestones. It also includes the announcement of a new game mode, changes to ship balancing like updates to the health, design, and interactions between ships. There were also weapon, equipment, and loot updates, as well as balances to the combat overall, like adjusting the respawn time to 16 seconds for dying outside your ship and 12 seconds for dying on your ship.</p>



<p>Then there were also user interface changes, quality of life updates, and of course, several bug fixes to help make the launch run smoothly.</p>



<p>"<em>The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible,</em>" said co-founder of Dreamhaven and chief executive officer Mike Morhaime, in a<a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/22/wildgate-the-crew-based-space-shooter-from-dreamhaven-and-moonshot-games-available-now/"> press release</a>. "<em>It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun. Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds</em>."</p>



<p>When<a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/"> Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Wildgate</a> earlier this year in March, he wrote "<em>The game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the game is out for everyone, hopefully it's able to live up to that promise.</p>
