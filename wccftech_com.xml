			<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has released the highly anticipated Helldivers 2: Heart of Democracy update on both PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>After fighting for democracy across the galaxy, players have swiftly been recalled back to Super Earth, where they'll have to fight against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-galactic-emergency-announced-new-enemies-and-weapon-customizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invading Illuminate</a>, a faction formed by an aquatic species known as Squ'ith. Super Earth Armed Forces had nearly annihilated them, but in secret, they built a fleet called The Great Host, which is now invading Super Earth.</p>
<p>In a major change of environment from the usual planet, Helldivers will fight among towering skyscrapers and crowded streets while the Illuminate rain down destruction all around. Inside the city biomes, players must tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns. They must fight to control areas where the fleet is landing, in what Arrowhead has described as a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, struggling against the incoming forces, with the potential to gain and lose control quickly.</p>
<p>Helldivers will find help in the Super Earth Armed Forces troops, who fight on their own but can be ordered to follow players and provide temporary backup as they navigate toward objectives. The ultimate goal is to activate Super Earth's Planetary Defense Cannons to take down the Illuminate fleet. However, Helldivers must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. Any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 was just updated with a new and powerful primary weapon customization system. Most primary weapons now have levels that can be achieved by completing missions. These levels unlock new attachments that can be obtained through Requisition. Players can also unlock weapon patterns.</p>
<p>The weapon customization system allows tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazine capacity, optimizing weapon performance characteristics with muzzle adjustments, or customizing under-barrel attachments for optimal handling.</p>

			<p>20 million Nintendo Switch 2 units could be shipped by March 2026, and production can also ramp up further if needed, although the capacity of hardware assemblers may not allow for more shipped units than predicted.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzcxMTYxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ4MzE2NDE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JURURUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.otPPN3UUhc4q42s5epuIhmbzdF6WijHgG7OKH4-CY9k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, anonymous sources, who have also confirmed the system's SoC is being produced on Samsung's 8nm process node, revealed the production pace should be fast enough for Nintendo to ship more than 20 million units by March 2026. The Korean company is ready to ramp up production if needed, although much will depend on the capacity of the hardware assemblers like Foxconn. Interestingly enough, but not surprisingly, considering that Samsung has provided OLED panels for one of the original Nintendo Switch hardware revisions, the Korean company is also reportedly pushing for its OLED panels to be used in future hardware revisions.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 now being around two weeks away, more information on the system is being shared. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">Last week</a>, we learned more about its final system specifications, which mostly align with those that leaked online earlier this year, limitations that developers will have to work around, such as CPU cores and RAM not available for games. Additional details have also come in about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat</a>, which may be demanding to run, so much so that the system's SDK allows developers to test it without an active session, and VRR support, which won't be available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-not-support-vrr-in-docked-mode-nintendo-finally-confirms/">docked mode.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

			<p>The Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 collaboration is going live today, introducing new content inspired by the latest entry in the CAPCOM fighting series, such as new skins and signature special moves as emotes.</p>
<p>The collaboration event, which will run from today May 20th until June 2nd, brings eight new skins, the highest number of any Overwatch 2 collaboration, for Hanzo, Juno, Sigma, Soldier 76, Kiriko, Winston, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta. These skins change the character's appearance and introduce new animations and visual effects inspired by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> central game mechanics. All eight skins can be purchased with the Street Fighter 6 Ultra Bundle, but those who wish to get only some of the eight skins can either purchase the Mega Bundle 1, which includes Legendary Juno as Chun-Li, Hanzo as Ryu, Zenyatta as Dhalsim and Epic Sigma as M.Bison, or Mega Bundle 2, which includes Legendary Kiriko as Juri and Widowmaker as Cammy in their fiercest forms, with Winston as Blanka and Soldier: 76 as Guile. All fighters are also available individually.</p>
<p>For the duration of the Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 collaboration event, players will also be able to take part in special time-limited challenges that will reward them with up to 40,000 XP, exclusive themed sprays, voice lines, and the Street Fighter player title. More information on the collaboration event can be found on the game's <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24178101/overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-6/">official website</a>. A trailer showcasing the new content can also be watched below.</p>
