			<p>Today marked the first of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-conducting-largest-franchise-playtests-to-ensure-the-games-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several public large-scale playtests</a> for Battlefield 6 and, inevitably, the first screenshots and gameplay leaked on the Web. We've embedded a couple of these leaks, which originated via Reddit, below. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5jbil/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a Community Update focused on gunplay and movement philosophy for the upcoming title.</p>
<p><em>We're designing the combat experience to ensure players of all skill levels can enjoy our gunplay and movement systems. Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>For gunplay, we're exploring designs centered on helping you learn and develop skills and muscle memory through action, as weapons naturally signal their recoil direction. This feedback loop allows you to understand and adjust your aim, making it easier to handle different weapons. This system not only adds variety but also enhances each weapon's unique feel and play style.</em></p>
<p><em>Movement is also deeply integrated with gunplay, as your actions and targets are all part of the same cohesive combat experience. We aim to make movement both feel intuitive and rewarding to move within the world and during combat, but also when playing against someone using both the gunplay and movement systems to their maximum potential.</em></p>

<p><em>We’ve reduced the time it takes for bullets to appear on your screen from when you press fire. This change decreases input delay, makes shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets.</em></p>
<p><em>We're optimizing for a 60Hz tick rate, ensuring the game server more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players. This results in responsive gameplay across all platforms and inputs. You'll notice more precise shooting and movement, enhanced damage feedback, and more accurate representation of other players' positions and combat outcomes.</em></p>
<p><em>We've adjusted the recoil system to make the different weapon types feel unique when firing them. Through enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles, each shot’s recoil direction now matches its gameplay angle. The weapon visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you're actually firing and controlling it.</em></p>
<p><em>To evolve the moment system we've revamped animations and reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive and landing roll, and added visual indicators to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible.</em></p>

<p>As a reminder, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has four studios</a> focused entirely on it. DICE is leading development on multiplayer; Motive (the studio behind the Dead Space remake) is crafting a 'meaty' single player campaign; Criterion is 'driving content experiences' across both single player and multiplayer; and Ripple Effect is working on what has only been described as a new experience fueled by the Battlefield DNA.</p>
<p>Following the underwhelming commercial launches of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, the third time has to be the charm for the franchise. The game doesn't have a release window yet, but it's likely EA will push to get it out at some point this Fall.</p>
