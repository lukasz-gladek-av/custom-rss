			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> is finally live after an unexpected month-long delay, something that, according to <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">won't happen again</a>. The new season went live with the introduction of the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, several new weapons, and the introduction of a new limited-time mode featuring a new gameplay mechanic, <strong>VL-7</strong> hallucinogenic gas.</p>



<p>The new season's arrival has driven the game's highest concurrent player count on Steam so far in February 2026, with the game currently sitting at <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#1m">90,265 players</a></strong> at the time of this writing. If the concurrent count is able to break <strong>100K</strong>, it'll be the first time that's happened for the game in over a month, since the last time it reached above 100K was back on <strong>January 11, 2026.</strong></p>

<p>If you want an overview of everything coming in Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown of the new content in the pipeline here</a>. I also got the chance to spend a couple of hours with some of the new content at a press preview event last week ahead of launch, and you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/">read my impressions of what I played here</a>.</p>



<p>While the introduction of a new map, the new VL-7 Strike limited-time mode, new weapons and vehicles are all welcome additions, as I noted in my preview, what will likely be more welcome by players are the changes to progression pacing with regard to how quickly players can move through the battle pass. </p>



<p>Part of why so many players dropped off from the game after the launch of Season 1 and REDSEC, besides the slow pace at which new content was delivered, was how much of a slog it felt to try and work through the battle pass. Hopefully, these changes (which you can see in the notes below) are able to make working through the rewards for this season more engaging than they were for Season 1.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Is by Far the Most Played Game of Old-School FPS Guru John Romero: “I Lived in That Game for 5 Years”]]></title>

			<p>Here's something we weren't really expecting to read: <strong>John Romero</strong>, the man behind some of the greatest old-school first-person shooter games (<strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong>, <strong>Doom</strong>, <strong>Quake</strong>), revealed that his most-played game of all time is <strong>Blizzard's World of Warcraft</strong>. That's about <strong>as far from the games he's most renowned for as you could imagine</strong>, being an MMORPG with stylized visuals and tab-targeting combat. And yet, Romero himself <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/doom-co-creator-john-romero-adores-ghost-recon-and-has-over-3-000-hours-in-world-of-warcraft-god-i-lived-in-that-game-every-day-for-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told PC Gamer</a> that <strong>he lived in Azeroth for five years</strong>:</p>



<p><em>It's World of Warcraft. I have probably 3,000-plus hours in WoW. God, I lived in that game every day for five years. Six hours usually, every day. And then weekends were as long as I could stay awake. I was making an MMO at the time, and studying that game was really important to me as far as "Why do I want to do this? Why am I putting up with this? What are you thinking about second to second while you're doing this?"</em></p>



<p><em>I was in a raiding guild. You name it, I did so much stuff. I have five main characters with all the gear of different classes. And I had 10 characters total. When you start a new character, you're starting the game from the beginning, but I knew how to optimise burning through. I could get to level six in half an hour.</em></p>



<p><em>It's always important to look at those successful games and the systems that are in them as a battle-tested system. The way that they implemented this has been played by millions of people, and they have kept it for years. It works. That's really important for design to just look at those examples. Not that you would directly copy anything, but that you understand why it was done that way and how it works.</em></p>



<p>The MMORPG John Romero mentioned working on was never revealed, though it was likely during his time at <strong>Slipgate Ironworks</strong>, between <strong>2005</strong> and late <strong>2010</strong>, which fits the five-year timeline and also coincides with <strong>World of Warcraft's heyday</strong>. We only know it was based on an original IP. The game designer is also credited with a Special Thanks for the free-to-play MMO <strong>Marvel Super Hero Squad Online</strong>, which was launched in 2011 by Gazillion Entertainment. </p>



<p>Romero recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-romero-talking-companies-finish-game-funded-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>he's talking with other companies to continue developing his next game</strong> after <strong>Microsoft pulled out as a funder</strong>. He then <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-have-never-played-a-game-like-this-before-doom-creator-john-romero-compares-next-game-to-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that it's a very unique game that will be innovative in a similar way to what <strong>FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> did for open world games.</p>



<p>As for World of Warcraft, Blizzard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the roadmap toward the launch of the game's eleventh expansion pack, <strong>Midnight</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Shows Off More Marathon Gameplay in New Impressive Trailer Ahead of Open Preview Server Test Weekend]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, is out on PS5 and PC in a little more than two weeks' time from the time of this writing. Despite it having a rough road to launch, now that we're so close to it, the game looks more impressive than ever, and its new 'Death Awaits' trailer ahead of its <strong>open preview server slam test</strong> next weekend is the latest example of just how solid it looks.</p>



<p>The server slam test will give Bungie the chance to let the servers get pushed to their limit right ahead of launch, as the test will take place from <strong>February 26 to March 2</strong>. Marathon arrives on PC and PS5 three days later, on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on Marathon's journey, how it looks is not the only impressive thing about it; it's also impressive to see the buzz around the game. It was always going to have an uphill battle, coming in as the game that had to shoulder Bungie's future hopes while its marquee franchise, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">Destiny</a></strong>, continued to flounder.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH AWAITS | Marathon Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marathon lost its <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">game director amidst a scandal </a>near the beginning of its production. It's suffered through <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">more than one round of layoffs at Bungie</a>. It had a massive scandal regarding the game's whole artistic foundation and aesthetic being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">ripped from another artist without permission</a>. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a>, ad even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">believed to be dead</a> by some of its biggest doubters. </p>



<p>Its closed, NDA-protected beta tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-leaked-closed-technical-test-bungie/">kept leaking gameplay like crazy</a>, and the last major public beta test <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">wasn't as well-received as Bungie would've hoped</a>, even providing a solid sounding board for other games to do better.</p>



<p>Now, though, as we sit days away from launch, even though it's still far too early to say Marathon has the ability to 'save Bungie,' it looks clear that this won't be a flop. Marathon has the chance to start off strong and grow into another strong title in Bungie's portfolio.</p>
