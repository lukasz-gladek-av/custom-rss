<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director‚Äôs Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven‚Äôt seen Kojima‚Äôs vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what‚Äôs actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what‚Äôs come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director‚Äôs Cut, there‚Äôs little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 5 Pro patch uses some of the console's features to deliver the best version of the game until the launch of the PC version.</p>
<p>From today, owners of the upgraded PS5 model will be able to enjoy the second entry in the remake project with a variety of improvements introduced by the 1.050 patch. The patch introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Versatility Mode</a>, which targets 60 FPS like Performance Mode but offers a high resolution equivalent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Im0BR2QmIk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphics Mode</a> thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. Additionally, the update uses the PlayStation 5 Pro High CPU Frequency Mode to offer a more stable framerate throughout the game.</p>
<p>Besides providing the details of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch, Square Enix also shared a few screenshots showcasing how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks on the system in Versatility Mode. You can check them out right below.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide today. With improved specs and the aforementioned PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the system introduces improvements to over 50 titles that have already received their PS5 Pro patch. Even games that haven't received a dedicated patch can see improvements, as showcased by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/">early tests</a> conducted earlier this week.</p>

			<p>In its Q3 2024 earnings report, published yesterday, South Korean publisher Kakao Games provided updates on its upcoming game slate, including the highly anticipated Unreal Engine 5 action MMORPGs ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey.</p>
<p>The first game, as you might remember, is nothing more than ArcheAge 2's rebrand. In late September, when the title change was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> and explained, we still got a generic 2025 release window. However, the updated Kakao Games release schedule has moved ArcheAge Chronicles to the fiscal year 2026, which is to say, at some point in the calendar year 2026.</p>
<p>Two additional games are also dated for FY2026: the looter shooter Project S and the action RPG based on The Swordmaster's Youngest Son IP. All of these games will be released globally for PC and consoles, just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>. The MMORPG developed by NPIXEL's Chrono Studio will launch in the last quarter of 2025, around this time next year. Here's a brief overview by the producer:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey is an "open-world MMORPG where time dictates destiny," and we are committed to integrating all the core elements showcased in the trailer into the game. Players will be able to experience exhilarating battles with colossal bosses, adventures that utilize the "Chronotector," a device that manipulates time and space, complex characters, and innovative storytelling. We look forward to the day we can share these features with you.</em></p>
<p>Kakao Games is also publishing Path of Exile 2 in Korea and the strategy RPG Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch globally. The latter game has just launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530490/Lost_Eidolons_Veil_of_the_Witch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> and will get a full release next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>In Q2 2025, Kakao aims to publish version 1.0 of the action roguelite shooter Section 13 (also currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Section_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>), while Q3 2025 will see the Korean debut of Project Q, an Unreal Engine 5 isometric open world MMORPG for PC and mobile made by Lionheart Studio, the team behind Odin: Valhalla Rising. <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11158890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Korean media</a>, Kakao has also signed a global publishing deal for Project Q.</p>
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2025, Kakao will launch two more games globally alongside the aforementioned Chrono Odyssey: the zombie survival game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073940/God_Save_Birmingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God Save Birmingham</a> for PC and the MMORPG Ares: Rise of Guardians for mobile devices and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fiscal-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new financial report</a> for the second quarter of Take Two's fiscal year 2025, they have announced that they've sold Private Division,<a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-is-likely-to-be-sold-or-closed-down-by-take-two/"> the company</a> behind games like OlliOlli World and, more recently, No Rest for the Wicked, which was only released in Early Access on PC in April 2024. At the moment, the buyer of Private Division is completely undisclosed, and it remains a mystery as to who could have bought them out. However, Take-Two Interactive has stated that they have purchased "substantially all of Private Divisions live and unreleased titles." This message comes with the confirmation that support for No Rest for the Wicked will continue, and the support will be continued by Take-Two themselves.</p>
<p>The stated reason for selling Private Division is that the company now wants to focus on the "core and mobile businesses for the long term." Management of Take-Two has stated that the company remains "exceedingly well-positioned for the long-term," which a clear vision in mind, and has "one of the strongest portfolios of owned intellectual property in our industry."</p>
<p>When it comes to finances, Take-Two has mentioned that they have made $1.47 billion in Net Bookings with outperformance from both the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises. GTA VI is a game that is highly anticipated by fans of the franchise, with the first trailer being shown earlier this year. However, since that trailer, there have been very few details about the game. Additionally, this year saw the release of the Borderlands movie, which didn't exactly perform as they had hoped.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to report that we delivered strong second-quarter results. Our Net Bookings of $1.47 billion were at the top of our guidance range, driven by the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises, and our operating results surpassed our plans, largely due to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses within the year," says Strauss Zelnic, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, they have reiterated that they are expecting a massive increase in Net Bookings for the fiscal year 2025 and have hoped to make $5.55 to $5.65 billion. The report also states the upcoming release dates for Take-Two's future lineup, including Civilization VII, WWE 2K25, and, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is due out in the Fall of 2025.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether selling Private Division will lead to layoffs within the company. Unfortunately, this is a typical cycle when companies are sold or acquired by others in the industry.</p>
