			<p>Yet another Microsoft studio has taken advantage of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labour neutrality agreement the company signed with the CWA (Communications Workers of America)</a> to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard through, and this time it's DOOM developer id Software, with 165 developers at the Texas-based studio voting in favour of forming a wall-to-wall union.</p>



<p>Announced with <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa">a press release from the CWA</a>, union members cited wanting to protect elements of their work, like being able to work remotely, ensuring "<em>responsible</em> <em>use of AI</em>," as lead services programmer at id Software and union member, Chris Hays, told <a href="https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/">Aftermath</a> in an interview.</p>



<p>"<em>The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives</em>," said id Software producer and union organizer Andrew Willis in a press release. "<em>The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.</em>"</p>



<p>This past August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 developers working on the Diablo series at Blizzard voted in favour</a> of forming a union with the CWA, and in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers United QA were able to reach a tentative deal with Microsoft</a> to finally ratify their union contract after two years of negotiating.</p>



<p>"<em>Remote work isn't a perk,</em>" Hays added in the CWA press release. "<em>It's a necessity for our health, our families,</em> <em>and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being.</em> <em>With a union, we will have the opportunity to make sure that everyone has a voice in the things that matter most to us</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the developers at id Software have voted in favour of the union, they will have to go through the process of getting a contract agreement and then getting that agreement ratified. It took the ZeniMax Workers United QA union two years and a strike to get their contract done, which doesn't bode well for the other unions under Microsoft currently trying to get a contract agreed on and signed. But voting for the union is still a major step towards better working conditions for the developers.</p>



<p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has changed the video game industry in a myriad of ways, but perhaps one of the most significant ways will end up being how it allowed a labour movement within the video game industry to gain serious momentum. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm very proud to be a part of this effort to organize our studio, to have a voice in decisions that directly affect myself and my coworkers</em>," said organizing member and senior VFX artist at id Software, Caroline Pierrot. "<em>In an industry that has proven to be very unstable over the last few years, more unions means more power to the workers and a real shot at shaping the future of the industry for the better</em>."</p>
