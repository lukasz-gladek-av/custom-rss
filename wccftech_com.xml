<p>"<em>After running playtests with our Discord community over the last 6 months, and receiving some fantastic feedback, we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions,"</em> writes Brendan Greene, also known as PlayerUnknown, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>We have a great survival experience, with millions of maps for players to explore in the Open Beta, and over the coming months leading up to our Early Access launch, we plan to add more features to further customize your preferred way to play</em>."</p>



<p>So while this is not the full release of Prologue: Go Wayback!, it will be the biggest look at the game for players so far, who will now have more than enough time to spend wandering the wilderness in this survival title.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-1-hour-new-gameplay-team-ninja-explains-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of fresh new gameplay footage</a>, Team Ninja has now also shared an estimate of how long Ninja Gaiden 4 is going to be when it releases later this year. <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Australian website Next Play</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama said that the first playthrough should take most players between fifteen and twenty hours, but then there are also the Challenge Missions to consider.</p>



<p><em>Your first playthrough, you can expect about 15 to 20 hours. But, like I mentioned before, after you beat the game once, you unlock Master Ninja difficulty and then, of course, outside of the story mode, there’s also the challenge missions and also chapter challenge as well … so there’s going to be a robust amount of content for players to sink their teeth into after they complete their first playthrough.</em></p>



<p>Regarding these Challenge Missions, Hirayama-san added:</p>



<p><em>In the full release, there’ll be missions outside of just boss fights. So you have to fight in groups of enemies under special conditions that differ from what you experienced in the story mode.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 also offers some optional battles hidden within the game 'Purgatory', and you can even wager before entering these fights. Hirayama explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s kind of an evolution of the Tests of Valor that were in previous Ninja Gaiden games. The idea of having players choose the level of risk for that reward, that was something we included to kind of stoke the flames of challenge.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, with Xbox Game Studios publishing the title. It will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Just like all the games published by Xbox Game Studios, it will also be available for PC and Xbox Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[European Gamers Spend More on Microtransactions than North Americans, says Newzoo, but they’re also More Likely to Buy Something on Sale]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/european-gamers-spend-more-on-microtransactions-than-north-americans-says-newzoo-but-they%E2%80%99re-also-more-likely-to-buy-something-on-sale.1268127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm for videogame industry sales has collaborated with <a href="https://www.tebex.io/">Tebex</a>, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game purchases to publish a report that dives into player spending in North America and Europe. </p>



<p>The <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em> report has more than a few interesting revelations about player spending in North America and Europe, like how players in those two regions are the minority of the world's gamers but <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">drive nearly half of all spending in the videogame industry</a>.</p>



<p>But the videogame industry is not what it was 20 years ago, where spending trends would be mostly based on players buying individual games. Microtransactions are the name of today's game in the modern videogame landscape, and there are some interesting differences between North American players spending on microtransactions versus European players.</p>



<p>At a top-level look, players in Europe spend on microtransactions than players in North America, with sports games being the top genre in Europe, while shooters are the top genre in North America. "<em>Microtransactions make up nearly half of PC and one-third of console gam revenues in Europe</em>," according to Newzoo and Tebex.</p>

<p>In both North America and in Europe, however, consoles are the only platforms where premium game purchases still account for over 50% of player spending. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But when it comes to why players are spending their hard-earned cash, the reason for hitting the 'buy now' button is very different for players in North America and players in Europe. 28% of European players, according to Newzoo and Tebex, will choose to spend their money in the videogame industry if something is on sale or at what they deem to be a 'good price.' Whereas North American players top reason for buying anything is so that it gives them access to extra or exclusive playable content.</p>



<p>Buying something because it's on sale is the fifth of the top-five reasons listed for North America.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as what microtransactions players are buying in North America and Europe, however, those lists are much closer. Four out of the top five categories of in-game microtransaction purchases are the same between North American and European players, with players in both regions prioritizing expansions, power-ups, in-game currencies, and in-game subscriptions.</p>



<p>Loot boxes or gacha, as they're listed by Newzoo and Tebex, are at the bottom of the list for both North America and Europe, but that feels at least slightly misleading, since it seemingly means loot boxes purchased directly with real money, rather than a player buying an in-game currency to then spend on loot boxes.</p>



<p>For all the new statistics and bits of information shared in Newzoo and Tebex's report, one element that isn't news to anyone is, to the chagrin of some players, microtransactions and virtual currencies are not going anywhere, anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>Virtual currencies and microtransactions are no longer just revenue streams</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>They're becoming strategic levers for retention and differentiation</em>."</p>
