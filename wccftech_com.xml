			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Hw3clSJDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox Main Theatre Show</a> at PAX West, the Texas-based game developer unveiled the endgame and post-launch roadmap for Borderlands 4, which is due to launch in less than two weeks. In the upcoming game, players will continue to progress their characters through weekly challenge missions and unlockable specializations to further customize their loadout.</p>



<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is returning, albeit reimagined from previous iterations. This post-game difficulty option challenges players with five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, based on lessons learned from previous games in the franchise, players no longer need to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will advance through curated mission challenges that test their chosen build. These challenges grow more difficult as players progress, eliminating the need to re-farm the same gear.</p>



<p>Each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode rank includes exclusive Firmware set bonuses for gear that players will first find while playing the campaign. The first loot drops with Firmware should start appearing around level 25. The more Firmware a player acquires, the higher their stat bonus will be. These powerful bonuses can be transferred to another item once, after which the original item is destroyed, and the firmware bonus cannot be transferred again.</p>



<p>Multiple incentives will be provided to encourage Borderlands 4 players to continue searching for the best loot. Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates.</p>



<p>The Maurice's Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, offering varied loot for every player. These activities are all available for online matchmaking, as you'd expect in this type of game.</p>

<p>Gearbox Software then switched to discuss the game's post-launch roadmap, starting with the free updates. Seasonal Mini-Events will kick off in October with Horrors of Kairos offering new Legendary Weapons, Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Invincible Bosses are also returning to test players’ skill and build inside high-level new boss arenas that integrate the new traversal mechanics introduced with Borderlands 4. Powerful new Legendaries are the juicy rewards for players strong enough to defeat Invincible Bosses. Additionally, a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level will release alongside each Invincible Boss.</p>



<p>As for the paid DLCs, there will be two types: Story Pack and Bounty Pack. The first of two announced story packs, scheduled for Q1 2026, features the return of fan-favorite Ellie in "Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned." With a cosmic horror theme and a bloodier, darker tone than the main campaign, this Story Pack includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, and all-new legendary gear. It also introduces the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. Additionally, this pack includes four new Vault Hunter skins, two new vehicle skins, three ECHO-4 drone skins, and one ECHO-4 frame, as well as attachments.</p>



<p>The first Bounty Pack will arrive earlier than that, in Q4 2025. In Bounty Packs, Borderlands 4 players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the universe. These missions reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, beginning with Rush, the gregarious leader of the Outbounders. Each Bounty Pack includes new main missions, a new boss, new legendary gear, one player skin, one ECHO-4 drone skin, one new vehicle, and a Vault card. This allows players to unlock 24 cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable gear.</p>



<p>The second Bounty Pack will land in Q1 2026 alongside the Pearlescent items (which will be free). Pearlescent gear drops will be challenging to find, but their power level matches their coveted rarity. Borderlands 4 is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on September 12</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must wait until October 3</a> to play it. </p>

			<p>Playtonic's enhanced version of Yooka-Laylee, the aptly named <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2025-make-the-jump/">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2, this coming October 9, 2025.</p>



<p>If you already own Yooka-Laylee, then you'll be able to upgrade to this new enhanced version at a 30% discount of its $29.99/£24.99/28,99€ launch price, and for those looking to collect a physical copy, you'll be able to pick one up for $49.99, though the added cost also gives you "<em>a selection of bonus goodies exclusively for retail,"</em> according to a press release.</p>

<p>"<em>Yooka-Replaylee is built to shine on every platform, and we’re chuffed to bits it’s on Switch 2 from day 01, it holds a special place in our hearts (and hands)</em>," said Playtonic studio director Gavin Price. "<em>It’s bigger, brighter, bolder, and packed with all the little touches we always dreamed of. We can’t wait for players to jump in</em>."</p>



<p>Chief marketing officer at publisher PM Studios, Ami Blaire, added "<em>It's rare to see a game get this kind of second life - not as a remaster, but as a true reinvention. It's</em> <em>the kind of release that reminds you why I fell in love with platform games in the first place."</em></p>



<p>Yooka-Replaylee does more than just add a fresher coat of paint to Yooka-Laylee. Elements of the story are retold, new story beats are added, the minigames of the original are removed and replaced with new isometric platforming challenges. There's new stuff to collect, revisions to camera and movement controls, a new soundtrack, and a new map to help you move through the adventure.</p>



<p>It doesn't necessarily feel like a remake; more like a 'take two' at the game, with how much is changed and added. We'll get to see how it compares to the first game when it arrives in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded arrived on all current-gen consoles, including PlayStation ones, just three days ago on August 26, and before its first week on store shelves is finished, The Coalition and Microsoft have announced that it has already surpassed 1 million players.</p>



<p>"<em>Ending the console war, one grub at a time</em>," The Coalition wrote in its <a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1961474052557557990?s=46">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Thank you for 1 million players.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a solid milestone for the remaster, even if the 1 million players isn't indicative of sales figures, since a good chunk of those players were likely ones who jumped in through Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>Overall, August 26, 2025, was a historic day for the video game industry, as games that were previously console exclusives for either PlayStation or Xbox jumped the fence to the other side. PlayStation players finally got the chance to check out Gears of War, and Xbox players finally got the chance to jump into the fight for democracy and Super Earth in Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, this resulted in making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/">best console to play Gears of War on a PlayStation console</a>, since the PS5 Pro is capable of delivering the best mix of performance and visual fidelity compared to the Xbox Series X and the base PS5.</p>



<p>There is more Gears of War coming, with the previously announced prequel, to the original games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/">Gears of War E-Day</a>, in development, and beyond the small screen of your home TV or PC monitor, Gears is headed to the big screen, with a feature film in the works. That, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-wont-debut-before-2027/">won't be out until sometime in 2027</a>.</p>
