			<p>Although the <strong>PC market</strong> has significantly gotten bigger over the years, consoles like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/">PlayStation 5</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/">Nintendo Switch</a></strong>, and its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">successor</a></strong> released last year continue to dominate the video games market as a whole in many regions of the world.</p>



<p>However, the increased number of releases on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC storefronts</strong> of the past few years indicates that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">something is shifting</strong>. So much so that some celebrated game creators believe that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC market has become dominant</strong> at this point.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">RPG Site</a></em></strong> focused on his latest game, <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Danganronpa</em></strong> series creator <strong>Kazutaka Kodaka</strong> was asked about the game's excellent PC port. His reply leaves no room for interpretation: <strong><em>"The market is dominated by PC now,"</em></strong> he said. <strong><em>"Releasing worldwide on Steam is essential."</em></strong></p>



<p>While <strong>Kodaka-san</strong> didn't add more about the matter, his confirmation that the team is <strong>not considering PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports</strong> of <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong> makes it clear how much the market seems to be leaving traditional home consoles behind, <strong>shifting towards PC</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pc-become-the-unified-gaming-platform">Will PC Become the Unified Gaming Platform?</h2>



<p>Following the heights of the early 2020s, when people spent more time at home playing video games due to the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, the video game market has been experiencing some <strong>turbulent times</strong>, putting the traditional business model that has held so far in question.</p>



<p>A few days ago, former Chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios <strong>Shawn Layden</strong> highlighted in an interview how the <strong>total install base of console users hasn't changed much</strong> in the past few generations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-trapped-in-this-containment-field-former-sony-exec-proposes-single-gaming-format-to-expand-console-market/"><strong>proposing the creation of a consortium</strong></a> in the vein of those which pushed for unified formats like the <strong>VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray</strong> to make the video games industry move towards a <strong>single gaming format</strong> that could be licensed out.</p>



<p>With releasing games on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Steam for PC</strong> seemingly having become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">essential</strong>, and both <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Microsoft and Sony</strong> increasing their focus on this market, it definitely feels like the industry may already be moving towards a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unified gaming format centered on the platform</strong>, whose appeal has further increased with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">handheld gaming systems</strong> like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbo</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">x</a></strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"> Ally</a></strong>.</p>



<p>With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-ram-prices-could-be-the-next-big-problem-for-pc-gamers/">massive price spike for RAM</a></strong> due to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-cost-increase-allegedly-behind-microsofts-rumored-new-massive-round-of-job-cuts/">AI craze</a></strong>, which is set to increase the price of almost every electronic device significantly, however, this move could be <strong>considerably delayed</strong>, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/">current console generation could be extended</a></strong> until the situation normalizes.</p>

			<p>Like in the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA</strong> took advantage of this year's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Consumer Electronics Show</strong> to make some important announcements. While the company is not launching any new <span>GPUs in the near future, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong>it has </strong></a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">announced</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">&nbsp;<strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a>, which features a new iteration of the&nbsp;<strong>Transformer model,</strong>&nbsp;as well as new&nbsp;<strong>Multi-Frame</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Generation</strong> features exclusive to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 series</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-591-74-driver-now-available-with-dlss-4-5-support/"><strong>With new drivers</strong></a> and update to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">NVIDIA App</strong>, it is now possible to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</strong> thanks to new drivers with every game that supports <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, delivering even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">better image quality than native resolution</strong> in some cases, such as in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>.</p>



<p>A new comparison video <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">created by&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmarkPC</strong>&nbsp;showcases the game running with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5,</strong>&nbsp;featuring the second-generation transformer model, side by side at&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p and 4K resolutions</strong>, with&nbsp;</span>ultra settings in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Quality, Balanced, and Performance</strong> modes on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 5080</strong> GPU.</p>



<p>The considerable image quality improvements over <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> are evident in the side-by-side comparison at <strong>1440p resolution</strong> in <strong>Quality mode</strong>, but even more impressive is how the new transformer model delivers <strong>better image quality than native resolution</strong>. This is easily noticeable with the <strong>terrain and grass</strong>, which look considerably sharper with <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Resolution transformer model</strong> isn't perfect, as it seems to have some trouble <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rendering leaves on trees</strong> correctly. In almost every instance, the trees look <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">noticeably worse</strong>. Still, considering the overall image quality, what <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong> is capable of <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">achieving is truly impressive, even with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-dlss-4-5-testing-reveals-drastically-crisper-details-but-older-gen-rtx-gpus-take-nearly-20-performance-hit/"><strong>widely reported&nbsp;performance impact</strong></a></span> over the previous Super Resolution models in every game tested so far. This performance impact, however, remains small on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 and 40 series</strong> thanks to the use of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FP8</strong> in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blackwell and Ada GPUs</strong>.</p>

This is to be expected, considering this is the new model's first release, which is only going to get improved in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the earlier confirmation that Lara Croft <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be played by <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> (Sansa Stark in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, Jean Grey in <strong>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</strong>) in <strong>Amazon</strong>'s upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> TV show, it has now been confirmed that <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong> and <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> have joined the main cast.</p>



<p>In a reveal exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q5jcp0/reddit_exclusive_new_cast_and_characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the official Tomb Raider subreddit</a>, Amazon outlined both roles from the existing gaming franchise and brand-new characters created specifically for the series. These are the picks for characters gamers will know very well:</p>



<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is&nbsp;<strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend.</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs is&nbsp;<strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle.</li>



<li>Bill Paterson is&nbsp;<strong>Winston</strong>, the butler of the Croft family.</li>
</ul>



<p>And these are the actors cast in entirely new roles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is&nbsp;<strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot (and snack collector).</li>



<li>John Heffernan is&nbsp;<strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's world.</li>



<li>Celia Imrie is&nbsp;<strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne.</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph is&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up a mess.</li>



<li>Sasha Luss is&nbsp;<strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce and deeply competitive new rival of Lara Croft.</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed is&nbsp;<strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted curator at the British Museum, dedicated to preserving history.</li>



<li>Sigourney Weaver is&nbsp;<strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's unique talents.</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein is&nbsp;<strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal tomb raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tomb-raider-tv-cast.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs are by far the most famous among the newly announced cast. Weaver's breakthrough role was, of course, <strong>Alien's Ellen Ripley</strong>, although she also featured prominently in the <strong>Ghostbusters</strong> and <strong>Avatar</strong> franchises, as Dana Barrett and Dr. Grace Augustine, respectively. As for Jason Isaacs, he is mainly known as <strong>Julius Malfoy</strong> in the <strong>Harry Potter</strong> movie saga; he also received acclaim for playing Captain Gabriel Lorca in <strong>Star Trek: Discovery,</strong> and more recently, as Timothy Ratliff in the third season of HBO's <strong>The White Lotus</strong>. Isaacs also voiced Lord Enver Gortash, one of the main antagonists in <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong>.</p>



<p>Amazon's announcement included messages from Sophie Turner and <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong>, the creator, writer, executive producer, and co-showrunner, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been attached to the show since early 2023</a>.</p>



<p><em><strong>Sophie Turner:</strong> I’ve been a long-time fan of Tomb Raider and the character of Lara. She has always felt for me, very emboldened in a male dominated world. She’s a fierce female role model!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge:</strong> Tomb Raider boasts a plethora of iconic characters. I am thrilled to have been able to bring some personal and fan favourites to the screen while also introducing a few new rascals of our own to the mix. This cast is beyond my wildest dreams!</em></p>



<p>The TV show's debut season is slated to start production on <strong>January 19, 2026</strong>. Its release will therefore realistically happen at some point in 2027 on Amazon's Prime Video. Meanwhile, Lara Croft fans can revisit the first game in 2026's <strong>Legacy of Atlantis remake</strong> and prepare for a bombastic 2027 that will also see the release of a brand new game titled <strong>Catalyst</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>
