			<p>Despite having been released a long time ago, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> continues to be one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">most popular open-world games ever</strong>.</p>



<p> Since the launch of the next-gen update, however, it's been up to the <strong>modding community</strong> to add new content and features to the game, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-if-kaer-morhen-wasnt-destroyed-the-witcher-3-online-introduces-full-fledged-multiplayer/"><strong>a full-fledged multiplayer mode</strong></a>, but in the past few weeks, it's been suggested that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong>a new official DLC could be launching later this year</strong></a> to bridge the gap with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-justice-predecessor-legacy/"><strong>next entry in the series</strong></a> and begin the marketing for what is set to be another massively popular role-playing games.</p>



<p>Following the rumors that circulated online last year, we haven't received <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/third-the-witcher-3-dlc-rumors-intensify-more-polish-websites-confirm/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an update on this rumored DLC</strong></a> in some time, but more <strong>indications that it could indeed be happening</strong> surfaced today.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, <strong>reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong> was asked on X about the rumored <em>The Witcher 3</em> DLC. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I have; but am working to confirm details further</em>," <strong><a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021090282050289783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the insider said</a></strong>, a sort of <strong>corroboration</strong> that bodes quite well given Nate the Hate's <strong>excellent track record</strong>.</p>



<p>Nate the Hate isn't the <strong>only notable individual</strong> to have talked about <em>The Witcher 3's</em> rumored new DLC in 2026. <span>As spotted on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0vki2/some_new_witcher_3_dlc_leaks_natethehate_claims/" target="_blank"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, UV o grach, former editor-in-chief of Polish publication Gry-Online, and Ryslaw, project lead for the first entry in the seri</span>es, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqcPJeESnN8&amp;list=LL&amp;index=9&amp;t=5071s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both heard that this DLC is real and coming at some point. </a></strong></p>



<p>While<strong> neither is currently associated with CD Projekt Red in any form</strong>, it stands to reason that both could have a connection to the studio, and theirs <strong>may not be baseless speculation</strong> or just reiterating what looks more like a badly kept secret.</p>



<p>Needless to say,<strong> the prospect of <em>The Witcher 3</em> getting new DLC</strong> so long after <em>Blood and Wine</em> is making the community <strong>excited</strong>. Not only are many interested in seeing how CDPR would bridge the gap between the third and fourth entries in the series, possibly clarifying which of <em>The Witcher 3</em> endings will be canonical, but others hope this will become <strong>an industry trend.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"DLCs for old games is something that should happen more. Especially DLCs like The Witcher 3 ones, properly sized,"</em> said Reddit user Extreme-Purchase-512, echoing a wide sentiment among gamers. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">development times for big AAA titles getting longer and longer</strong>, continued support for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">older but still popular single-player games</strong> is something many would like to see. Hopefully, this DLC will sell well enough to show other publishers that this practice would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">economically viable.</strong></p>

			<p>The <strong>depth of the combat system</strong> has always been the signature of the <em>Nioh</em> experience, and this is no different in Nioh 3. With the addition of a second fighting style, Ninja Style, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/"><strong>combat is now deeper than ever</strong></a>, featuring so many <strong>unique techniques</strong> that let players play the way they want without penalty.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">there's no real "correct" way to play the game</strong>, it's undeniable that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-dont-waste-skill-points-in-nioh-3-the-essential-samurai-and-ninja-martial-arts/">Martial Arts</a> and Skills are more useful than others</strong>. Among the Skills you can equip, however, there is one called <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The More the Merrier</strong> that can take<strong> your gameplay to the next level</strong>, no matter which fighting style you prefer to use.</p>



<p><strong>Welcome to the Dojo</strong>: here's why<strong> The More the Merrier is a game-changing skill in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</strong></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-what-does-the-more-the-merrier-do" data-level="2">What Does The More the Merrier Do?</a></li><li><a href="#h-where-to-find-the-more-the-merrier" data-level="2">Where to Find The More the Merrier?</a></li><li><a href="#h-why-is-the-more-the-merrier-an-essential-skill" data-level="2">Why is The More the Merrier An Essential Skill?</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-more-the-merrier-do">What Does The More the Merrier Do?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-The-More-the-Merrier-Skill-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier has a lot of different uses that can take your gameplay to the next level</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The More the Merrier is a Common Skill</strong> costing 4 skill points to equip with a very straightforward function. It allows you to <strong>cancel your actions and allows you to use Summoning Seals, </strong>the special Talismans you get to summon Yokai by equipping any Soul Core to the Yang position in your Onmyo Box.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-more-the-merrier">Where to Find The More the Merrier?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-The-More-the-Merrier-Location-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier location in the Warring States map</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The More the Merrier can be found</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">relatively soon</strong> during your first playthrough. Its skill manual can be found on a corpse in the <strong>Futama region</strong> in the <strong>Warring States map</strong>, to the north of the Master of the region.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-more-the-merrier-an-essential-skill">Why is The More the Merrier An Essential Skill?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Summon-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier can make Summoning Seals a lot more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the function of The More the Merrier skill may not look like much on paper, possibly only speeding up Summoning Seals execution, the skill opens up a lot of incredible combat options in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animation Canceling:</strong> Use Summoning Seals to cancel <strong>any</strong> attack animation in both Samurai and Ninja Style. This makes high-commitment Martial Arts with long recovery times, such as the Odachi’s <em>Thunderbolt</em> or the Cestus’ <em>Limitless</em>, much safer and more viable.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stagger &amp; Pressure:</strong> If an enemy is out of Ki or blocking, the summon will keep them staggered in place. This allows you to safely continue your offense or recover your own Ki for a follow-up.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive Repositioning:</strong> If you misread an enemy’s timing, you can cancel your attack into a summon. Because you can walk in any direction during the summoning animation, you can avoid incoming attacks or recover quickly enough to guard, deflect, or dodge.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Summoning-Seals-loadout-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier skill allows you to take advantage of all sorts of Summoning Seals in creative ways</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Strategic Loadouts:</strong> Since Summoning Seals are limited and replenish at Shrines, you can customize your approach via the Onmyo Box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equip cores in the <strong>Yang position</strong> that grant more total seals to cancel animations more frequently.</li>



<li>Equip the most powerful seals to take advantage of any Soul Core Passive Skill as a last resort to unleash massive combos on enemies with depleted Ki.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Skeleton-Warriors-Summoning-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using Summon Seals with The More the Merrier skill makes it easy to pin down enemies out of Ki for some devastating combos</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Personal Recommendation:</strong> Using the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Scampuss</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skeleton Warrior</strong> cores is highly effective. Their seals deal damage multiple times quickly, keeping the enemy locked in place while you recover Ki to restart your Martial Arts sequence.</p>
