			<p>NetEase Games just unveiled the January 2026 roadmap for <strong>Where Winds Meet,</strong> the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/where-winds-meet-everything-we-know-about-the-wuxia-open-world-action-adventure-rpg/">new open-world, Wuxia action RPG</a> that arrived in November 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/">After last month's batch of updates introduced a new region for players to explore and new bosses</a>, the roadmap for January is more stacked with new events, story content, and what looks like the most intense version of helping the elderly get to where they need to go with <strong>Elder Express</strong>.</p>



<p>The headline for the January 2026 roadmap is the arrival of Where Winds Meet version 1.2, which introduces several elements to the game, including the Nine Mortal Ways Camp, a new puzzle cave called Mistveil Prison. It also includes the final Kaifeng volume and a new campaign challenge boss called Supreme Freedom.</p>

<p>The other big addition with v1.2 is the introduction of large-scale multiplayer combat in Guild Battle Preseason. Guild Battles are coordinated efforts that will require you to work with your fellow guild members to secure a victory. If you try to win it solo, you'll do so at your own peril.</p>



<p>As this is NetEase's first introduction of these battles, the Preseason is a short, six-match tournament that is more about letting players try out the new mode so NetEase can see what players like, dislike, and how it can be adapted. "<em>This preseason is crucial for us to gather player feedback and refine the core Guild Battle mechanics</em>," said NetEase Games in a press release. "<em>We encourage all guilds to rally their members, hone their tactics, and prepare for the even more expansive guild content planned in upcoming updates</em>."</p>



<p>While the incoming content for January 2026 has already started to roll in with the new Unbound Solo mode and the new Hero's Realm having arrived on January 4, everything else will arrive this Friday with the version 1.2 update beginning on <strong>January 9, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Including Elder Express, a new game mode that sees you run through the streets with an elderly person on your back, which players can jump in and out of without any prerequisites.</p>

<p>In just its first month, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-surpassed-15-million-players-in-its-first-month/">surpassed 15 million players around the world</a>, after already hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">9 million players before the game even made it to mobile devices</a>. It's been the latest massive launch from NetEase Games, following the studio's hit shooter, Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Even though it's still very early in the game's life, its rocket-ship launch makes it seem like NetEase is about to start dominating yet another genre within live service games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">In Wccftech's review,</a> Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

			<p>Goichi <strong>"Suda51"</strong> and <strong>Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> require no introduction, as they have developed some of the quirkiest games ever released on PC and consoles. After working on new entries in the <em>No More Heroes</em> series and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/"><strong>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</strong></a></em>, the legendary game designer and his studio began working on <strong>Romeo is a Dead Man</strong>, their <strong>first IP in a very long time</strong>, which looked like a Suda51 game through and through, even <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture-studio-reveals-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-ps5-in-2026/">in its announcement trailer.</a></strong></p>



<p>The game's unmistakable feel was also evident in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/"><strong>short demo I was able to check out during Gamescom 2025</strong></a>, with intense action and an overall artistic direction that I have found close to <strong>Quentin Tarantino's style</strong>, something I told Suda51 himself when I had the chance to speak with him about <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em>.</p>



<p>Besides saying that he <span>is often told this,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank"><strong>Suda51 also discussed</strong></a></span><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> how the game's story and setting were heavily inspired by Back to the Future and FBI TV shows.</strong></a> I couldn't see much of this influence in the Gamescom demo, but after playing through the game's first two chapters in a more relaxed setting, these influences are difficult to ignore. It is difficult not to notice how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> has the potential to become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best games ever made</strong> by the Japanese development studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Romeo-is-a-Dead-Man-Preview-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Romeo is a Dead Man's story can get weird at times, but it's surprisingly engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Suda51, "Romeo is a Dead Man" was inspired by a <strong>"what if" scenario from Back to the Future: what if Marty McFly died?</strong> What would have Doc Emmett Brown done? He would have gone back in time and saved Marty. And this is precisely what <strong>Benjamin Stargazer</strong> does to save his nephew Romeo, returning to the moment he was going to be killed by a mysterious creature, fitting him with the <strong>Dead Gear Life Support System</strong> to save his life.</p>



<p>This, however, creates a <strong>Time Paradox</strong> which shatters the space-time continuum, transforming reality into a <strong>chaotic multiverse</strong>. To restore the world, the <strong>FBI Space-Time Division</strong> recruits Romeo, who becomes an agent under the name of <strong>DeadMan</strong>. Traveling through space-time, Romeo will not only pursue some heinous space-time criminals, but also seek his girlfriend, <strong>Juliet</strong>, who appears to be connected to the major crisis that has disrupted the entire universe.</p>



<p>If this premise sounds a little confusing to you, you are not alone. In its first two story chapters, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> feels like a mish-mash of very diverse concepts, where the aforementioned influences are blended with a gameplay formula that's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">markedly Suda51</strong>. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hack-and-slash</strong> experience is fairly straightforward, combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">melee and gun combat</strong> in a simple yet effective way, enriching both with unique mechanics such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloody Summer</strong> - an all-powerful attack that can be unleashed once enough blood has been gathered - <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Bastards</strong> - special skills unleashed by friendly enemies with a lot of different offensive and support effects - and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">shoot weak points</strong> on certain enemies to deal massive damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210180216_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Boss fights in Romeo is a Dead Man are set to be one of the highlights of the experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the game's very first chapter is essentially the entirety of the Gamescom 2025 demo set in a swamp area ending with a boss fight against one of the many <strong>versions of Juliet</strong> roaming space time, it's the <strong>second chapter</strong> that proved to be the most surprising, to me. Following some story sequences aboard <strong>The Last Night</strong> ship, which serves as the central hub, rendered with a <strong>top-down view and 16-bit visuals</strong>, Romeo is sent to his baptism of fire in an <strong>abandoned mall</strong> to seek out a space-time fugitive who has been wreaking havoc across time.</p>



<p>It's in this mall that the very diverse ideas behind <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> started coming together. While the <strong>Dead Rising inspiration</strong> was evident throughout the stage, fighting zombie-like enemies using newly unlocked weapons like the <strong>fists and heavy sword weapons</strong>, unleashing Bloody Summer to restore health in a bind, and jumping between real space and <strong>Subspace</strong>, an alternate dimension accessed by using an <strong>old TV set</strong> showing a mysterious individual making almost nonsensical philosophical commentary, to reach power generators scattered all over the place is quite fun, thanks to a somewhat <strong>intricate level design</strong> that makes it easy to look past the relative linearity of the game's world. As is the battle against the space-time criminal, who turns into the massive <strong>Enhanced Phantom</strong> whose diverse moveset puts Romeo's battle skills to the test, forcing him to move between <strong>two different floors</strong> to avoid powerful area-of-effect electric attacks.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210181909_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The shifting art style is one of the features that defines Romeo is a Dead Man</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As highlighted by the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Back to the Future</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dead Rising</em> inspirations, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> often feels like a <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">celebration of entertainmen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> media as a whole</strong>. The references are scattered everywhere, even in Romeo's progression systems, which include a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">minigame that plays like a classic labyrinth arcade game</strong> from the 80s to increase his stats, and a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pong-like minigame</strong> that must be completed to pinpoint the next space-time anomaly, and thus criminal to take down. All of this does make the experience feel a little messy, but it's undeniable that it also gives <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">certain charm</strong> that is too often missing in modern AAA video games.</p>

<p>With the game's first two chapters being so markedly different from one another, I really can't wait to see what else <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> has in store, and if the quality on display in the first hour or so of the game will hold up for the rest of the experience. If it does, I am confident the game has the potential of becoming <strong>one of the best games ever made by Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> when it launches on <strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/"><strong>February 11</strong>.</a></p>
