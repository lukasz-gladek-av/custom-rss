			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase Games has just revealed new details about the upcoming Season 2: Hellfire Gala update that will go live next week on April 11, 2025. The new season adds X-Men Emma Frost to the lineup, and Ultron, who spoils the gala Frost is hosting in the Mutant nation of Krakoa.</p>
<p><span>This is also the setting of the new maps that'll be added with Season 2, which, according to a press release, will feature "<em>dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks</em>."</span></p>

<p>Weekly missions will also be added with Season 2 on top of the already included daily missions, just to give players a little more to do during the three-month-long season.</p>
<p>Speaking of season length, NetEase also revealed that beginning with Season 3, a season in Marvel Rivals will only be two months long, with a new playable character introduced each month.</p>
<p>For Season 2, the first half will introduce Emma Frost as a new Vanguard character, with Ultron, and details about his character type, still to come in the second half of the season. Season 2 will also feature the first time NetEase adjusts or removes certain team-up abilities, which means the game is about to undergo some of its first major changes.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched at the end of 2024, and has so far accomplished what many big publishers have tried and failed to do, which is carving out a slice of the live service pie for itself. NetEase boasts that the game has grown to beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">40 million players</a> since its launch, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Marvel Rivals definitely has an advantage over games like Sony's failed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/">Concord</a>, which was also attempting to establish a new set of characters and a new world for players to enjoy, but as we saw in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers,</a> a big IP backing up your game doesn't mean it'll be a smash-hit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 2 Hellfire Gala | Dev Vision Vol. 05 | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOuv0tO_aLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NetEase even admits in its developer vision presentation that the studio understands the pressure it is under to sustain the success Marvel Rivals has enjoyed so far. These changes coming in Season 2, which are still to be laid bare in the full patch notes still to come, could prove to be the beginning of a turning point for the game, with the next check coming with the arrival of shorter seasons in Season 3. This was a move made specifically to try to keep players engaged and not let the game stay too stale.</p>

			<p>Immediately after Donald Trump announced his proposed tariffs that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, and then a second wave on Wednesday, April 9, there was speculation across the video game industry as to how this would impact games.</p>
<p>So far, the sentiment is that these tariffs will have a huge impact on the video game industry, and the latest report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File</a> reveals that the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expects the tariffs to have "<em>a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry.</em>"</p>
<p>Game File spoke to Aubrey Quinn, senior vice president at the ESA, who said that gaming hardware, for example, will be hit on multiple fronts, not just from the tariffs levied against countries like Vietnam, China, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>"<em>Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another,</em>" said Quinn.</p>
<p>It was already speculated that the tariffs on Vietnam and Cambodia, in particular, could potentially impact the pricing of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Quinn's point is that there's more to gaming hardware that comes from other countries beyond Vietnam and Cambodia, which means that the base 10% tariff levied against all imports to the United States will only add on to the already high tariffs on specific countries.</p>
<p>Quinn did add, though, that the ESA remains "<em>optimistic that there will be a solution that doesn’t damage U.S. industries, ours included, and doesn’t hurt U.S. consumers</em>."</p>
<p>As we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad believes that Nintendo won't raise the price of its new console anytime soon, at least on the specific question of the pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we could still see things shift with these tariffs for the better, with the potential still remaining for a deal to be reached with exemptions for certain products, a lower tariff, or no tariffs at all being levied. Those deals, however, will take some time to set up with each impacted country, and in the meantime, we could still see the video game industry take a serious hit.</p>
