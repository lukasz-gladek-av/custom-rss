			<p>Bethesda has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new patch for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered to the Steam Beta ring. If you wish to download it, just switch to the beta tab in your Steam library.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 introduces a series of fixes to performance, quests, and gameplay. Arguably, the most interesting could be the allegedly reduced frequency of stutters when traversing the open world, which were really dreadful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at launch</a>. Here's the performance and visual related changelog:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>

<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>

</ul>



<p>Lastly, Bethesda Game Studios has introduced new difficulty options to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, specifically for Player Combat Damage and Enemy Combat Damage. Players can now select from “Novice”, “Apprentice”, “Adept”, “Journeyman”, “Expert”, and “Master” options in the Gameplay menu. The developers expressed the hope that the “Journeyman” setting would act as a better bridge between “Adept” and “Expert” for players.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered is currently still 20% off on Steam due <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Summer Sale</a>, but the discount is only available for less than ten hours, so hurry up if you are interested.</p>
