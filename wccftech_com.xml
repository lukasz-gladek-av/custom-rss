			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the project that CD Projekt RED just can't put down, as the studio has <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">announced</a> that it is releasing yet another significant update for the game, with Patch 2.3, that'll be revealed in full tomorrow, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in one of the studio's RED Streams livestream presentations. </p>



<p>It'll premiere at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST, and you'll be able to tune in either on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cdprojektred">Twitch</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aFLKoZaHak8">YouTube</a>. The stream will feature PaweÅ‚ Sasko, the associate game director on the upcoming sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and Adrien Jouannet, the lead designer at Virtuos. </p>



<p>While we don't know exactly what this new update will include, the announcement post on the game's official X account includes a few hints that point to the update specifically dealing with cars in Cyberpunk 2077. "<em>We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update</em>," the post reads. It then calls Sasko and Jouannet <em>"passengers," </em>and adds an emoji of a tire to cap everything off. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Beyond this new update, it's already a big week for Cyberpunk 2077, since the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-arriving-for-macs-this-week/">officially coming to Apple Silicon Mac users this week, on July 17, 2025</a>. Which is the second new platform for Cyberpunk 2077 this year, after it also arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> at launch.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED reported sales numbers for Cyberpunk, it had sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">30 million copies</a>. It'll be interesting to see how many more copies it adds to that milestone, with two new platforms in the mix.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tone-deaf-hiring-call-ai-slop-microsoft-layoffs/">Xbox</a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/15/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the next batch of games being added to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service, with nine titles entering the service for subscribers for the month of July 2025, including Grounded 2, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Wheel World, RoboCop: Rogue City, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the games added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this month aren't available today, as there are a few games launching directly into the service. The only 'new' game of sorts that players can jump into today with Game Pass, is High on Life, which is returning to the service after it was previously available and removed from the service. </p>



<p>Beginning on July 17, RoboCop: Rogue City and My Friendly Neighborhood are added to the service. For RoboCop, its arrival in Game Pass also lines up with the release of its brand new DLC, Unfinished Business, though the DLC is not available in the Game Pass version that subscribers will have access to. You'll still need to grab the DLC separately if you devour the base game before the month is up.</p>

<p>On July 18, RPG Back to the Dawn enters the service, followed by Abiotic Factor launching into Game Pass on July 22. Then on July 23, Wheel World, a new open-world bicycle game is also launching into the service, followed by yet another day-one launch into Game Pass with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on July 24.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 then launches into early access on Steam and Game Preview on Xbox consoles on July 29, and July's additions are capped off by Farming Simulator 25 joining the service on August 1. Here's the full list of games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the month of July 2025: </p>



<ul>
<li>High on Life - July 15 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>



<li>RoboCop: Rogue City - July 17 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>My Friendly Neighborhood - July 17 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>

<li>Grounded 2 - July 29 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Farming Simulator 25 - August 1 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this new batch of games entering the service, there are a few games leaving Game Pass as of July 31. It's just three games this time, with Gigantic, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, all leaving the service at the end of the month.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-is-the-mmorpg%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-out-on-october-28.1244214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet is announcing Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, the next expansion coming to the MMORPG after the final update <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for the previous expansion, Janthir Wilds</a>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, ArenaNet <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched to a yearly expansion model</a>. As such, you can expect Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity to launch relatively soon, albeit a couple of months later than Janthir Wilds did in 2024, as Visions of Eternity will be available from October 28. The new expansion is already available for pre-purchase <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/visions-of-eternity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> for $24.99, and includes a bundle of pre-purchase bonus items, including a Tropical Resin Kintsugi weapon set, a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. </p>



<p>The Deluxe Edition, priced at $49.99, comes with the standard edition bundle, plus another batch of exclusive items: a Castoran Tentacled skimmer skin, a set of Fairyâ€™s Call Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Visions of Eternity Ultimate Edition (which costs $74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, Guild Wars 2â€™s premium in-game store currency.</p>



<p>Guild Wars 2 Game Director Josh Davis said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Visions of Eternity continues our commitment to major yearly content expansions. Over a decade into the gameâ€™s life, weâ€™re making improvements and enhancements to game modes and systems, expanding the horizon of Guild Wars 2â€™s gameplay. This expansion is offering up more elite specializations to further grow the possibilities for player customization and gameplay while becoming more seamlessly accessible across game modes and activities.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new narrative of Visions of Eternity begins with rumors of Castora, a fabled island allegedly rich with magic and ley energy, as told by the seafarers of Tyria. The Tyrian Alliance receives word that the Inquest, the infamous group of evil Asuran technology researchers, has been searching for the island of Castora. Together with allies willing to brave an unknown voyage, the Commander (the title of the player character in Guild Wars 2) sets off to discover the Inquest's goals and stop them before it's too late.</p>



<p>On day one, players will be able to explore two new maps in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, with two more coming throughout 2026 in post-launch updates alongside new Raid Encounters, a new Convergence, new rewards (including new earnable items in the Wizard's Vault), two extensions of the storyline, new legendary gear. </p>



<p>Each profession (the game's term for class) will receive a new Elite specialization, greatly increasing the amount of build options thanks to new traits and utility skills. As with the previous expansions, ArenaNet will open up beta access to the Elite specializations for a week, between August 20 and 27, to anyone with a game account.</p>

<p>The Skimmer aquatic mount will be expanded with three new Mastery lines. The housing-like Homestead system is also being augmented with a new plot on the sunny beaches of Castora and the brand new game-wide Homestead Layout feature, which will allow players to easily and quickly share their customized space with others, allowing a perfect duplicate of a construction (provided that the player has the requisite decorations).</p>



<p>When it comes to new gear, a legendary weapon and a legendary Aquabreather will be available on October 28, with a legendary ring, a legendary accessory, and another legendary weapon to be released in later patches. Of course, there will also be new armor and weapon sets and new Wizards Vault rewards, as mentioned above.</p>



<p>ArenaNet's parent company, NCSoft, may have more or less inadvertently <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertised</a> that the studio is already working on Guild Wars 3, but if that's the case, they still have a big enough team to continue building Guild Wars 2.</p>
