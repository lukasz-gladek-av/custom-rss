			<p>If you're dipping your toes into the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular MOBA</a>, League of Legends, you'll notice that there are a few roles for you to try out in Summoner's Rift. If you want to try your hand at jungling, you'll need to get to grips with the best routes for clearing, how to gank your opponents, and how to shot call on essential things like taking the Dragon or doing Baron Nashor. However, before you can think about that, you need to choose a jungler. Here are some of the best junglers to choose from if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>

<h2>Best Beginner Junglers in League of Legends</h2>
<p>Jungling can be quite tricky to get a handle on, especially as you are responsible for maintaining your health, mana and dealing enough damage to kill jungle camps efficiently on your own. On top of that, you have to juggle responsibilities such as warding, having a good lane presence, and overthrowing the enemy jungler. If you want to try your hand at being a jungler, here are some of the best for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Amumu</strong> is a great jungler to start with, regardless of what season it is. Not only does he have a lot of ganking capability, but he has a relatively smooth camp clear. Typically, with Amumu, you start at Raptors using your E so that you don't have to get a leash from either the top or bottom lane. This means that the lane that would be helping you doesn't miss out on vital early-game minions, and you can get your early-game camps with minimal issues. Amumu has great crowd control, with his Q stunning the enemy and pulling Amumu to the opponent, and his Ultimate stuns everyone who is in the circle.</p>

<p><strong>Nocturne</strong> is incredibly fun and has the potential to snowball and hypercarry if you play him correctly. He can be a bit difficult to get to grips with, but he has a ton of potential. It would be best if you found the balance between getting farm and ganking lanes to be able to be a threat to the opponent. One of the keys to being able to be a good Nocturne is using your Ultimate to gank an ally and help them pick off their lane opponent. Getting those assists in any time your Ultimate is up is key.</p>

<p><strong>Sejuani</strong> also has a lot of potential this season and is relatively easy to learn. If you don't like the idea of being a squishy jungler, Sejuani is perfect to pick. She gets quite tanky and can survive team fights and lane ganks with ease, especially with the aid of her crowd control. Of course, like any jungler, you need to make sure you find the balance between farming and ganking. However, she has a lot of defensive options with her knockback, her Ultimate, and the slows that come with it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No matter the season,&nbsp;<strong>Vi</strong> remains viable. She has a lot of damage potential and is more of a bruiser than a tank jungler. She has great damage output and camp clear, with added mobility in her Q. With how her Ultimate and Q work, it makes it easy for Vi to gank a lane. However, due to the skill shot nature of her Q, it can be difficult to land the hit on a champion, especially if they move unpredictably. Despite that, Vi is a lot of fun and has great potential if she can get ahead.</p>

<p>These are some of the best beginner junglers you can try out in League of Legends right now. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>
