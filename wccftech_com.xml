			<p><strong>Hytale,</strong> the <strong>Minecraft-like</strong> MMO that went through a long journey of <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">the game being acquired by a major publisher</a>, only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">to be shut down by said publisher</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">saved by its original creators</a>, and finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">put in players' hands earlier this month</a>, has reached another milestone, further marking its meteoric resurrection.</p>



<p>The game is officially one of the "<em>fastest-growing mod communities</em>" on the popular mod platform <strong><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></strong>, with Hytale players downloading <strong>more than 10 million mods</strong> for the game, with a little more than <strong>2,000 mod creators</strong> supplying more than <strong>3,000 mods</strong> in just two weeks.</p>



<p>CurseForge has been the official mod platform for Hytale since it launched, and <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> founder and chief executive officer, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, even credits the platform as a part of Hytale's success.</p>



<p>"<em>I have no regrets saving Hytale, and that’s entirely because of the community and our partners like CurseForge and Tebex who have made our early access launch a massive success</em>," Collins-Laflamme said in a press release. "<em>We came full circle, starting as modders and turning it into a game. Seeing fans build mods, worlds, and experiences at this scale, just weeks after launch, just validates why rebuilding was worth the risk</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Uri Marchand,</strong> chief executive officer and co-founder of CurseForge's operating company,<strong> Overwolf</strong>, added, "<em>Games are better when players get to create alongside the developers</em>. <em>From teenagers experimenting with the endless UGC possibilities to seasoned modders who have achieved a billion downloads, we’re giving Hytale creators a real path to build, share, and earn from their work through CurseForge and Tebex</em>."</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme has also been highlighting mods on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, further reiterating his love for Hytale's foundations as a mod itself.</p>

<p>Hytale kicked off to an impressive start, with Hypixel Studios reporting a "<em>very high</em>" number of concurrent users when the game launched earlier this month. Even before it launched, Collins-Laflamme announced that the game had already sold so well on pre-orders alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/"><strong>the next two years of development costs</strong> for Hypixel Studios were already funded</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the mods that Collins-Laflamme has highlighted, its modding community is also already pulling off some incredible feats. One mod that is not yet public but is particularly impressive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-crossplay-support-with-minecraft-thanks-to-impressive-mod/">added <strong>crossplay support </strong>between Hytale and Minecraft</a>. Two completely separate (albeit very similar) games, speaking to each other and allowing players in Hytale to play alongside their friends in Minecraft. It'll be even more impressive if/when the mod is made public. </p>
