			<p>The likelihood of a roleplaying game once again getting most Game of the Year prizes after 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 is very high thanks to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored many nominations from the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a>, with the winners due to be announced in a week from today.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the surprising sleeper hit of the year has received two endorsements from industry figures like Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Famitsu</a>, Spencer mentioned various games as his personal 2025 highlights, but ultimately picked Sandfall Interactive's debut title out of the bunch.</p>



<p><em>Excluding our games… I love the game I'm playing now, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that's very good. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was also good. Also, although it is a game for PlayStation 5 and PC, my friend director Kojima's Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The Game of the Year is probably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></p>



<p>While not exclusive to Microsoft's platforms, the game was available on its subscription service, Game Pass, from day one. As such, one could think Spencer might be slightly biased in his choice, but he's far from the only one who thinks Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserves such recognition. Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-directors-goty-pick-and-not-just-because-it-features-jrpg-inspired-combat-it-gets-all-of-the-elements-in-it-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Gamesradar the same thing</a>, although he was also careful to highlight how its merits go beyond the advancements made to turn-based combat:   </p>



<p><em>It's a really great game and would deserve Game of the Year. I'd like to see them get that. What makes that game so good is the fact it gets all of the elements in it right, and it balances them all at such a high level of quality. The setting, the world, the characters, and the storyline, those are all really well done as well, in addition to the gameplay. And I think it all comes together, and that's why it's such a well-regarded game, why the fans like it so much, why it sold as well as it had.</em></p>



<p>As you may remember, there was a bit of a controversy with Square Enix. A few years ago, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida famously excused the game's lack of a turn-based combat option <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the statement that it did not mix well with realistic graphics</a>. Following the smashing success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, some Final Fantasy fans have been hoping that Square Enix might change its stance in the future, but for now, there have been no such announcements. It will ultimately be up to the producers of the next mainline installments to choose what's best.</p>



<p>In other Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 news, one of the biggest Hollywood stars of the past couple of years has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expressed interest in being part of the film adaptation</a>. By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have our own TGS 2025 interview with Naoki Hamaguch</a>i about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Part 3, in case you missed it earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-custom-search-player-movement-progression-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised on Friday</a>, the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) have released the patch notes for update 1.1.1.0, which is set to go live tomorrow ahead of the debut of Season 1. The update will be released at 9:00 UTC, whereas the new season will be enabled at 15:00 UTC.</p>



<p>With this update, the developers aim to address some of the biggest pain points the Battlefield 6 community lamented in the game's first few weeks. For example, the player character's core movement and animations have been refined to provide smoother landings, faster stance transitions, and improved vaulting behaviour. Bouncing issues when landing or spawning have also been reduced.</p>



<p>When it comes to shooting, players have complained about weapon dispersion, which this patch reworks to better align the accuracy and handling of each weapon with its intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where the accuracy was inconsistent, such as when dispersion did not properly settle after sprinting. The developers believe the tweaks will bring the overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power.</p>



<p>Furthermore, users had requested visibility and lighting improvements, and the developers promise this new version of Battlefield 6 will feature better exposure transitions, interior lighting, and reduced fog and smoke persistence. There's even more to patch 1.1.1.0, including improvements to audio and user interface and, of course, a long list of fixes you can read all about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/534364965583194766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the official changelog post</a>.</p>



<p>Between this patch and the debut of Season 1, EA and the development teams are hoping to keep the momentum going. The game's launch was as successful as they wanted, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking franchise sales records</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnering acclaim from critics</a> and fans alike. Season 1 will be pivotal, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">based on the hands-on by our David Carcasole</a>, there are highlights (the new Conquest maps) and downsides (the new small group modes).</p>



<p>The Battle Royale mode is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to make its debut in Battlefield 6 tomorrow</a>, although there has been no official comment yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Forza Motorsport Series Is Just Resting for Now, Says Phil Spencer]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, when Turn 10 Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost over 70 members of its development team</a> as part of the latest round of layoffs mandated by Microsoft, a former employee <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Turn 10 had effectively been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio. This chain of events had fans fearful about the future of the racing simulation franchise.</p>



<p>Now, at last, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on this as part of a Tokyo Game Show 2025 interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Famitsu</a>. The Japanese magazine asked him whether the Halo and Forza Motorsport franchises were done for. Spencer vehemently denied that for Halo (which was quickly confirmed when the long-rumored Halo: CE remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced this weekend</a>), but had a more elaborate response with regards to the racing IP, hinting that it is currently 'resting' - albeit still not over.</p>



<p><em>No! Halo Studios is planning for the future and taking on new challenges. We're committed to Unreal Engine 5 and new technologies. We're committed to giving them the time they need to invest in the Halo franchise and create the next great game in the Halo series. </em></p>



<p><em>Regarding Forza Motorsport, we sometimes need to shift our focus to games that are released sooner. We understand the reaction many people had when we scaled back Turn10 Studios. We have a large number of games we want to support carefully, and sometimes we give development teams a little more time to avoid putting them under strain. Our current structure allows us this flexibility.</em></p>



<p><em>Xbox Game Studios has over 20 studios, and we have many games in development, each with different support needs. We have both short-term and mid- to long-term perspectives. We want our games to be successful. Xbox Game Studios is currently developing many titles, so please look forward to them in the future.</em></p>



<p>The thing is, Microsoft already tried giving Turn 10 Studios a lot more time with the next chapter in the racing series. Whereas the first seven Forza Motorsport games were released every two years without fail between 2005 and 2017, the last one, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reboot launched in 2023</a>, took six years to make and was still ultimately underwhelming according to most long-time fans. It also doesn't help that its sister franchise, the open world arcade racing game Forza Horizon, is massively more popular and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will return next year with the long-awaited Japan setting</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Comments on Gaming Copilot AI Controversy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-comments-on-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy.1335523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, a ResetEra user <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that the new Gaming Copilot AI installed by Microsoft on all Windows 11 PCs (integrated directly into the Game Bar) was training itself by screenshotting every game played by the user and then sending everything back to Microsoft. Gaming Copilot is also enabled by default, so if you want to turn it off, you need to go to the Game Bar, and then to Settings and Privacy Settings, where you will find the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "Model training on text" or not.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this discovery sparked a big controversy on what several users felt was a highly intrusive feature sneakily introduced by Microsoft. Following the news, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/microsoft-says-gaming-copilot-uses-screenshots-to-understand-in-game-events-not-for-training-ai-models-optional-feature-can-be-turned-off-but-not-easily-uninstalled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom's Hardware</a> was able to get a statement from the company about what the AI actually does:</p>



<p><em>When you're actively using Gaming Copilot in Game Bar, it can use screenshots of your gameplay to get a better understanding of what's happening in your game and provide you with more helpful responses. These screenshots are not used to train AI models, and Gaming Copilot is an optional feature that only has access to gameplay when you're playing a game and actively using it. Separately, Gaming Copilot may use its text or voice conversations with players to help train and improve AI. Players can adjust Gaming Copilot's privacy settings by visiting 'Settings' in the Game Bar, followed by 'Privacy Settings.</em></p>



<p>The AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first tested earlier this year on mobile devices</a>, though the global rollout only started last month on both PCs and the Xbox mobile app. Microsoft introduced Gaming Copilot as a sidekick specifically designed for gamers. Using AI, it recognizes which game is being played and understands the user's Xbox activity, allowing it to answer questions about games the user is interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the user's account, play history, and achievements. Essentially, it is a guide to the game, should the player need it. Of course, it should be entirely optional, and its training feature should be disabled by default to comply with privacy laws.</p>
