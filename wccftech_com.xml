			<p>Skydance Games and Amy Hennig's upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed once again, and will no longer hit its previously announced early 2026 release window, the studio announced today.</p>



<p>It's the second major game delay to be announced today, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI's delay</a> understandably taking up most of the oxygen. Skydance Games even made its announcement five minutes before Rockstar Games' post went live.</p>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Skydance Games wrote, "<em>Our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and the worlds we're fortunate to work with. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To fully realize our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we've made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026. We're grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses</em>."</p>

<p>We've known that Amy Hennig and Skydance Games have been working on a Marvel project for a while, though its official title <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">wasn't revealed until March 2024, at which point it was also slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, (shortly after Rockstar first announced GTA VI would launch in May 2026, in fact), Skydance Games confirmed that Rise of Hydra <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/">would not make its initially set 2025 release window, and pushed the game to early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, its release window seems to be sometime mid-to-late 2026, though we've been given no more specifics than that. Wherever it lands, it's clear that 2026 is shaping up to be a year for big releases.</p>

			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>

			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>

			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC</a> alleges that Square Enix is laying off staff in "<em>nearly all areas</em>" of its Western offices, with staff in its Europe and US offices hit. There's currently no word from Square Enix on how many have been impacted by this layoff, but sources told VGC that just from Square's London office, 140 employees are at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>The news was delivered to staff through an internal video call as part of a restructuring that Square had mentioned <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in the progress report it published today</a>, the same report where it boldly claimed that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/">wanted 70% of its QA work to be done by AI by 2027</a>.</p>



<p>In the progress report, Square writes, "<em>a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency</em>."</p>



<p>This aligns with VGC's report, which includes the same wording from Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu, who also added that this layoff is intended to make Square more "<em>lean</em>" and <em>"agile</em>." The cuts will save Square 3 billion yen annually, according to the company's projections.</p>



<p>Along with the cost savings, the cuts are meant to bring work that developers are doing at Square Enix closer to home, so to speak. In the progress report, Square says the decision came by intending "<em>To strengthen development capabilities from a Group-wide perspective and to optimize resource allocation for maximizing the value generated by IPs, a further review of the development pipeline was conducted. As a result, a decision was made to close overseas development studios and shift toward consolidating development functions in Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>Square is not the only Asia-based developer moving away from branching studios in other parts of the world. Shortly after a successful launch for Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">NetEase cut its California-based team</a> as part a restructuring to keep work on the game closer to its home studio. NetEase also shut down two of its subsidiaries, one yesterday, and one today, as part of its continuing restructuring to limit the number of branching studios it has in the Western world.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/">Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down with the loss of NetEase's support</a>, and today, NetEase closed Toronto-based studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-closed-yet-another-game-studio-funded-just-two-years-ago/">Bad Brain Game Studios</a>.</p>
