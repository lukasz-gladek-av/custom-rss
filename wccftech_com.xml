			<p>With Battlefield Labs continuing its testing phase with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more players</a> from various regions, new leaked videos of Battlefield 6 regularly appear on the Web. The latest one<span>, featuring a full match of Rush Mode from the Alpha, was posted yesterday on the Battlefield subreddit</span>.</p>
<p>So far, feedback from the test phase (and from these leaks) appears positive. Destruction is set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come back in a big way</a>, with the developers seeking to make it once again an integral part of the core Battlefield experience. Interestingly, destruction also causes rubble that remains on the map, creating new cover opportunities as the match goes on.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Battlefield 6 would be revealed this Summer with a launch planned by April 2026. However, the new game was nowhere to be seen at Summer Game Fest 2025. There are two options left: either it's going to be featured during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 (airing on August 19, 2025, 8:00 PM local time) or Electronic Arts is preparing a dedicated event specifically for this unveiling.</p>
<p>Four development studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the new Battlefield installment: franchise creator DICE is spearheading the multiplayer experience, while Criterion is working on content across both single-player and multiplayer modes. Motive is leveraging its expertise in storytelling and action (they crafted the single player campaign for Star Wars Battlefront II and worked on the Dead Space remake, in addition to making Star Wars: Squadrons) to deliver an engaging campaign for players to explore, which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> to be inspired by the movie Civil War and the TV show Lioness. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a new Battlefield experience "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA". This could be some sort of variation on the extraction shooter/battle royale formula.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will have to compete against <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. We don't have the release date yet, but it's safe to say it will be between late October and early November, just like most Call of Duty games. The new Battlefield could launch later and try to capitalize on potential discontent from COD users.</p>
