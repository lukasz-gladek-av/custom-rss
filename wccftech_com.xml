			<p>As part of Bethesda's <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5S63EJI5hmThAU6I8jaiQj/fallout-day-broadcast-2025-news">Fallout Day celebrations</a>, a new edition of Fallout 4 was unveiled: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, which includes all six official expansions, over 150 Creation Club items, making it the new definitive version of Fallout 4 across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S when it arrives on November 10, 2025. This new version is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, though we'll have to wait a little longer to see it arrive, since that version is scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>This new version is also part of celebrating Fallout 4's ten-year anniversary, since it originally arrived on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 10, 2015. The Anniversary Edition's launch will also mark the arrival of Creations in Fallout 4, as it will feature an in-game Creations menu letting you download and find even more creations along with what's already included.</p>

<p>Players who already own Fallout 4 or who have access to it through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass will be able to upgrade to the Anniversary Edition through two upgrade options, though Bethesda didn't share more details on those options at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Of course, this new version will also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-upgrade/">include the graphical upgrades we got in April 2024</a> for modern consoles, fully replacing the Game of the Year Edition as the new all-in-one definitive version to grab.</p>



<p>In other Fallout news, a physical anniversary bundle was announced for Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76 is heading to Ohio in a new expansion that'll arrive on December 2, right in time for Season 2 of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>

<p>Also, if you've never given the Fallout franchise a try, then this is certainly a good time to do so, since to go along with these new announcements, the games are all on sale on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation for a limited time.</p>



<p>This new edition of Fallout 4 is definitely nice to see as a way of celebration of the game's legacy, but it's yet another reminder of the fact that it's been a decade and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">there's absolutely no sign of Fallout 5</a>. It might even be close to another decade by the time the game does come out, since as far as we know, Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-will-be-microsoft-exclusives-ftc-says/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> in the works ahead of Fallout 5.</p>



<p>By the time it enters full production and is out on what will likely be the next generation of consoles and PC hardware, it'll be interesting to see if it can live up to the expectations that will have built up after years of waiting.</p>
