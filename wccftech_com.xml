			<p>Embark Studios, the studio behind the multiplayer shooter hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/">The Finals,</a> is set to have a playtest for its next release, Arc Raiders, which is due out sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Beginning this coming Wednesday, April 30, Embark will host its second playtest for Arc Raiders. The first playtest for the game happened last October and was only open to PC players. This time, it'll be open to players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside PC players, and it will run from Wednesday to next Sunday, May 4.</p>
<p>Embark showed off a new trailer for Arc Raiders today, ahead of the playtest kicking off on Wednesday, showing a bit more gameplay, including some shots of players battling giant robots.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Tech Test 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTRRb7ODhjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arc Raiders is a third-person shooter, rather than another FPS, and is a PvPvE extraction shooter. Back in 2021, it was initially meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">debut game</a> for Embark Studios, before it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">delayed</a> several times, due in part to it changing from its original vision, since it wasn't always meant to be a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Even with the delays and changes to what the game was originally meant to be, Arc Raiders is shaping up to be a game to watch out for. Embark Studios has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it can make a game with legs, even in an overcrowded shooter space, with its success with The Finals.</p>
<p>There's no reason to think it couldn't do the same with Arc Raiders, even after what many would consider to be signs of the game having a troubled development. If you're keen on checking out Arc Raiders, there's still time to sign up and potentially be selected for Wednesday's playtest through the game's <a href="https://arcraiders.com/">official website</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that global sales of its most acclaimed game, Elden Ring, have topped 30 million units. The news comes three years and a couple of months after the February 2022 launch of the open world RPG, which later won many Game of the Year awards (<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-22-best-games-of-2022-and-most-anticipated-of-2023-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including ours</a>). Elden Ring also received a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>The combination of the perfected Soulslike formula in an open world and the worldbuilding by G. R. R. Martin enthralled millions of fans, who finally got more content last year with the release of the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>. FromSoftware hasn't provided updated sales figures for the DLC, but we know from a previous report that Shadow of the Erdtree had sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five million copies in just the first three days on the market</a>. At this rate, it's likely to be approaching ten million, for a potential attach rate of one-third.</p>
<p>More Elden Ring is coming soon to fans, albeit with a wholly different flavor. The cooperative multiplayer spin-off Nightreign is set to launch in about a month, and the developers have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the official PC system requirements. Meanwhile, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview from the recent beta test</a>.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a brand-new IP called The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. They later clarified to worried fans that Nightreign and The Duskbloods (which also features multiplayer) <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not a hint at the studio's desire to abandon single player games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like many other creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">Yoko Taro</a>, creator and director of Nier Automata,&nbsp;fears that generative AI technology will advance to the point where it could replace game creators.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366">Famitsu</a>, Taro admitted his fears that game developers and creators could find themselves out of work in the next five decades, with how generative AI technology is evolving.</p>
<p>While speaking to Yoko Taro, Kotaro Uchikoshi, and Jiro Ishii, the topic of generative AI came up regarding how it could influence the video game industry and what its impact will be on creative industry's overall.</p>
<p>Uchikoshi began saying, "There are<em>&nbsp;a lot of new games I want to create, but with AI technology evolving at such a high speed, I fear that there is a possibility that AI-generated adventure games will become mainstream</em>."</p>
<p>Taro added, "<em>I, too, believe that game creators may lose their jobs because of AI. There's a chance that in 50 years, game creators will be treated like bards...I think that in the future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve</em>."</p>
<p>It's understandable that Taro would have these fears, as it is for any creative to share these concerns, though it's not an inevitable fate. Generative AI may be constantly improving, but it's still a pipe dream to imagine that it would, in any genuine way, replace the best artists of our time. For video games, Yoko Taro is one of the best artists in the industry.</p>
<p>He'll still be regarded as such 50 years from now, and there will be a whole new crop of creators pushing the industry forward. Generative AI technology can and will improve as much as possible. Still, it won't ever be able to create anything new in the same way artists like Yoko Taro can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from Korean outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/new-korean-starcraft-rights-ip-nc-soft">VG247</a>) marks the end of a rights battle between Nexon and Blizzard, seemingly resulting in Nexon, not Blizzard, leading development on the next major entry in the StarCraft series.</p>
<p>Blizzard will be working alongside Nexon to create this new StarCraft game, which could potentially be something besides a new RTS game, if Nexon really wanted to shake things up, that is. RTS games are incredibly popular in Korea, as is the StarCraft series. Moving away from the genre is a huge gamble, since the players who are looking for something to follow up 2013's Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm are probably looking for another RTS game, not a different game set in the StarCraft world.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just win the ability to make a new StarCraft game in its rights battle though, it also won the opportunity to make a mobile version of Overwatch for Japan and Korea, which has immense potential considering the popularity of mobile games in Asia.</p>
<p>In both cases, this amounts to a big loss for Blizzard, with Nexon now having the keys to what could be a very lucrative castle that Blizzard has arguably fumbled. Of course, we're still a while away from seeing if Nexon will be able to capitalize on its chance here properly, but the potential is still undeniable at this stage.</p>
<p>Especially if Nexon does come out with a StarCraft game that shows how Blizzard's behind in the genre. That both companies collaborated on the game won't matter to players if Nexon can demonstrate that it was their influence that helped make the next game a success, should it be a success, that is.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate for Blizzard that its track record of late has been other studios showing that they can take something Blizzard did and do it better. It arguably happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/">Overwatch</a> and how hero shooters have evolved since then. Many would argue that's what <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile</a> has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, and Nexon coming in to do the same with StarCraft would be the next nail in the coffin.</p>
