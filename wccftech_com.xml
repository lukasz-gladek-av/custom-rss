			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>

			<p>Starting tomorrow, Fortnite players will be able to jump into a new creative island made by Epic Games called Disneyland Game Rush. It's a limited-time creative island that includes seven mini games, each inspired by different famous Disneyland and Disney World attractions and rides as part of the 70th anniversary of Disneyland.</p>



<p>It's not the massive persistent universe that Fortnite and Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/">have been planning and working on for more than a year now</a>, but it's perhaps a small glimpse as to what that might look like, and from a technical standpoint, a big step forward towards creating the look of the Disney theme parks within Fortnite.</p>



<p>The seven mini-games include games based on newer attractions, like the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Sneak Out! game, based on the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout ride, has you sneaking around and completing the mission without being caught. A Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown mini-game has you putting down as many Stormtroopers as possible.</p>



<p>However, for the big Disney parks fans, the more meaningful mini-games are likely the ones based on Disney parks classics, like the Space Mountain: Rocket Race mini-game, the Metterhorn: Slip-and-Climb mini-game, and the Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt mini-game.</p>



<p>A report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks?utm_source=threads,twitter"> IGN includes some screenshots</a> of the game modes and what players can expect when they jump into the island once it is available to the public tomorrow, November 6, 2025.</p>
