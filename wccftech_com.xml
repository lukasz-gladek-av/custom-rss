			<p>Mafia: The Old Country developer Hangar 13 dug into plenty of behind-the-scenes details about making The Old Country during a PAX East panel. The team discussed their approach to making The Old Country, a few more details about the game's narrative, and also revealed a few core members of the cast.</p>
<p>The panel was hosted by Greg Miller from Kinda Funny Games, with Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, game director Alex Cox, and cinematic director Tomas Hrebick representing the development team for <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot we already know about The Old Country, some of which we learned more about during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">gameplay trailer that was revealed ahead of the panel</a>. One aspect fans were happy to hear was that The Old Country would be closer in style to the first two Mafia games in that The Old Country is a more linear experience, and not necessarily an open-world game.</p>

<p>Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes did however clarify this point, that while the game will have you on a golden path through the story, you're still free to roam the new setting of 1900's Sicily and explore the world that the team has meticulously created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>In terms of the gameplay, Baynes called it "<em>familiar, but better</em>," while Cox elaborated that there are elements to the gameplay and scenarios that are unique to The Old Country due to the new setting for the series, since each previous Mafia game has been set in an American city. Some of the missions and things you'll do in The Old Country however, are purposeful callbacks to activities veterans of the series will recognize that have been re-tooled to fit The Old Country.</p>
<p>Knife dueling, for example, is one of the new additions to gameplay that we get a short look at in the trailer, that will play a significant role in The Old Country's combat. That's not to say you won't be using a gun every now and then, as the trailer also showed a fair bit of gunplay that Cox and the panel likened more to the first Mafia game, than Mafia III, which was a more bombastic experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the narrative, we were introduced to three cast members who are playing three main roles in the story. Enzo Favara, the lead character in The Old Country and the person you play as in the game, is played by Riccardo Frascari. The Don of the Torrisi family, Bernado Torrisi is played by Johnny Santiago, and Torrisi's daughter, Isabella Torrisi is played by Carina Conti.</p>
<p>Speaking of characters, towards the end of the panel, Cox did confirm that there will be as many as four returning characters from previous Mafia games making an appearance in Mafia: The Old Country, though he did not reveal who it would be and how, to avoid spoiling the surprise for players.</p>
<p>One interesting bit about the studio's work to make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible, relates to the cars we see Enzo drive in the game. They're some of the world's earliest vehicles, and Hangar 13 was able to find a collector in the Czech Republic who let the studio photograph, and even drive these cars and record them, to be as accurate as possible with how these old cars would have sounded.</p>
<p>Overall, it's clear that Hangar 13 put in a lot of work to make Mafia: The Old Country as detailed as possible. The game will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming August 8, 2025.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>
