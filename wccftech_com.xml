			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> recently, Saber Interactive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4464851965270032697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Obelisk update for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. The patch (version 5.0) is named after its main content addition, the Obelisk, a new PvE cooperative Operation where players are sent to Demerium. Their mission, which takes place during the final events of the story campaign, is to rotate a replica of the obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. The Space Marines must go through a dark tomb to reach their objective.</p>

<p>Moreover, a new nasty-sounding enemy has been introduced to all Operations that include the Thousand Sons. Here's an introduction by Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 Game Director Dmitriy Grigorenko:</p>
<p><em>The Tzaangor Enlightened is a disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid unit. They are fearsome opponents, especially when met in greater numbers. However, catching them after parry or during a long animation makes them an easy target. We strongly advise you to use Target Lock to face this enemy.</em></p>
<p>That's far from everything available in the Obelisk update. On the technical side, PC gamers can look forward to a performance boost in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 thanks to the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation. Saber also slightly improved performance and texture streaming speed, increased stability and reduced crashes, and improved the Anti-Cheat system.</p>
<p>There's lots of gameplay changes, too. Normal melee damage has been increased, and Blocking Weapons now feature different mechanics where they accumulate up to three stacks of melee damage buffs to be unleashed in a big area-of-effect attack. The stacks are only granted upon achieving perfectly timed blocks.</p>
<p>Things are quieter on the Firearms front, although Saber said Patch 7 will deliver a substantial rework of the currently underwhelming Weapons Perks. Meanwhile, Patch 6 will focus on a massive overhaul of Class Perks, specifically those that were found to be lacking.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has already sold over five million units across all platforms. With the game currently 20% off and a highly engaged community (94% of recent user reviews are positive on Steam), that figure is bound to rise further.</p>
