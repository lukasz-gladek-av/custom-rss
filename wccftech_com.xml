			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment has released FBC: Firebreak, its first cooperative multiplayer game set in the so-called Remedy Connected Universe. You can read our review-in-progress <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has just released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.80) that delivers day-one optimizations for the game. The driver also fixes several bugs in many games, as noted in the <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.80/576.80-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official changelog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening: stability issues</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25: stability issues</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2: displays shadow flicker</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: stability issues</li>
<li>Enshrouded: crashes after launching game</li>
<li>Monster Hunter World: stability issues when playing in DX12 mode</li>
<li>Gray Zone Warfare: stability issues</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals: stability issues</li>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut: Flickering/corruption around light sources</li>
<li>GTA V Enhanced: stability issues</li>
<li>Honor of Kings: World: stability issues</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5: stability issues</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: Image corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>FBC: Firebreak, like Control and Alan Wake 2 before it, supports the full extent of the NVIDIA RTX suite. It integrates DLSS 4, including DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction to enhance ray tracing fidelity and frame rates. Additionally, all GeForce RTX gamers benefit from the NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry (a feature that <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> in Remedy's Alan Wake 2, which also runs on the Northlight engine) when ray tracing is enabled, reducing CPU and GPU Bounding Volume Hierarchies build and update times and reducing VRAM consumption.</p>

<p>According to NVIDIA, FBC: Firebreak runs 9.3x faster on average when DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at 4K max settings on GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop graphics cards. Gamers equipped with the latest series of GeForce GPUs can play FBC: Firebreak with path tracing enabled at almost 200 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, at nearly 250 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5080, and at 362 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.</p>

<p>Another NVIDIA-partnered game, id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages, will receive its highly anticipated path tracing update tomorrow. On top of all the aforementioned DLSS features, the game also introduces NVIDIA's Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) technology, which enables the efficient computation of path-traced light; moreover, Shader Execution Reordering technology further enhances the performance of GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA reports that DLSS 4 accelerates performance at 4K by an average of 6.8x on GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 cards. The flagship GPU averages 234 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 registers around 167 frames per second.</p>

<p>In other NVIDIA DLSS updates, the vehicle combat racing game Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks recently exited Steam Early Access with support for DLSS Super Resolution. Later this week, Sloclap will launch the 5v5 multiplayer arcade football game REMATCH with integration for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>

			<p>At some point during development, Hideo Kojima made some changes to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach because the game was doing too well during playtests and wasn't polarizing enough, according to the game's co-composer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, French composer Woodkid talked about working with Hideo Kojima on the game and how challenging it was to write music that changes in real time while playing, and how difficult it was to put together the eclectic mix of musical genres the game's soundtrack features. When asked, at the end of the interview, about something essential the composer learned working on the game, Woodkid mentioned how, one day, Hideo Kojima confirmed his intention of making changes to the game because it was being too well-received in play tests. These changes, which reportedly include some script changes and the way some important events play out, were meant to make the game more polarizing, trigger more emotions and ensure people would love the game after initially disliking it, as this is how something gets loved for real, Kojima-san reportedly said.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Hideo Kojima not being too happy with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach's positive reception during play tests. <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Last month</a>, the legendary game creator commented on the matter with Edge Magazine, saying that he wished the game would be more controversial, as he isn't interested in developing games with mass market appeal. To see if the game will indeed be less controversial than its predecessor, we won't have to wait long, as it will launch on PlayStation 5 next week, on June 26th.</p>
