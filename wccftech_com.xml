			<p>We were fairly surprised when we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would feature HDR support, both built-in for the handheld screen and for the docked mode. However, its implementation is suboptimal, to say the least, and this is sadly not all that surprising.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> shortly after the console's launch, the edge-lit LCD display has just about mediocre HDR capabilities due to low peak brightness (around 450 nits). Furthermore, since it's not an OLED screen, it cannot benefit from that technology's intrinsic infinite contrast, which is always a boon for HDR presentation.</p>
<p>Docked mode doesn't have the same issues since it relies on an external display. However, it has other issues related to its calibration settings. We have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> this topic following a report from YouTuber My Life in Gaming, but now, the most renowned display expert on YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X84e14oe6gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his own video to dive into the issue of Nintendo Switch 2 HDR calibration.</p>
<p>I'm referring to Vincent Teoh of HDTVTest, widely regarded as the best YouTube channel when it comes to TV and display analysis. Teoh found several problems with HDR calibration on the new Nintendo console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective HDR calibration depends greatly on whether the user's TV supports HGIG or source-based tone mapping. The test pattern adjustment for max TML (tonemap luminance) reliably works only on HGIG-enabled displays.</li>
<li>The adjustment steps are just too many when compared to other console HDR calibration menus, such as the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, and there's no numeric indicator to help.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Switch 2's default paper white setting is brighter than the reference white level of 203 nits recommended by the ITU-R BT.2408, the standard for 1000 nits HDR10 content. This results in a perceptually flatter image where midtones are pushed too high, reducing dynamic range and leaving insufficient headroom for specular highlights, translating into a less impactful HDR presentation.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the adjustment steps for the paper white setting change based on the max TML previously set, further complicating accurate HDR tweaking.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="I Measured Nintendo Switch 2's HDR Settings - No Wonder Most Games Look Awful. Here's The Fix." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X84e14oe6gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How can the Nintendo Switch 2 HDR presentation be improved in light of all these issues? First, you should get an HGIG-compatible display, as that greatly affects how accurate HDR content viewing will be. If you must stick to a display that does not support HGIG, the best compromise is to set&nbsp;the max TML at 1000 nits and paper white around 200 nits to minimize clipping while preserving contrast.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a few settings to tweak. Switching the Nintendo Switch 2 console to dark theme mode reduces the influence of Automatic Brightness Limiter (ABL) when using OLED displays, preserving more consistent brightness and contrast. It's also important to set HDR output to “compatible software only” to avoid forcing HDR on SDR content. Lastly, the screen burn-in protection feature is redundant on modern OLED displays and useless on non-OLED displays, so it should be disabled.</p>

			<p>Tetsuya Mizuguchi's signature games blend synesthesia through art in a playable medium. From Rez to Child of Eden and the cult classic <a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-tetsuya-mizuguchi-synesthesia-tetris-effect-rez-lumines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tetris Effect</a>, the rhythm and visuals work in tandem to create an experience unlike anything else. While this isn't the first Lumines title, it is the first to build on the creative framework of Tetris Effect: Connected, both in terms of audio and visuals. Hands down, this was by far the one demo from Summer Game Fest 2025's Play Days that I kept coming back to and thinking about long after my thirty minutes were up.</p>
<p>True to the long-running puzzle rhythm series, Lumines Arise focuses on the gameplay of dropping 2x2 squares built from two different colors and linking together matching colors in various squares. Both dropping the squares and linking them together result in musical notes and beats, letting the player remix tracks on the fly as they reach that puzzling nirvana. Each track has its own layers of color palettes and music, and, while the transitions aren't as smooth as in earlier games, they blend from one song into the next once you clear a certain number of boxes.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games in the Lumines series, Lumines Arise is focused on the musical styling of a single artist: Hydelic, who longtime Enhance fans would recognize as the composer of Tetris Effect: Connected's soundtrack as well. Speaking with one of the onsite devs, there aren't currently any plans to bring in licensed artists like Mondo Grosso (who was the backdrop for one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xNTvN03TU">most memorable Lumines</a> stages of all time). This gives Lumines Arise more of a criterion collection focused on a single composer who has a knack for nailing a wide variety of genres. While I don't know the name of the track quite yet, one of the final demo tracks with a pair of chameleons headbanging to the bass drops had the best overall vibes of the whole session, with an energetic beat that gets elevated when you achieve a solid combo chain or Burst.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Lumines Arise plays out similarly to earlier titles. To assist players with chaining together squares and creating flashy combos, Lumines traditionally has a single upgrade when dropped, will link and destroy every block of matching color that's linked up and touched. This simple upgrade helps clear away trash and let a single matching color fall into place to hopefully create a chain of squares, but this is largely dependent upon the player's skill to have that foresight to link blocks together beforehand.</p>
<p>New to Lumines Arise is the Burst mechanic, a new twist that allows players to build up a meter over time and unleash a powerful Burst that essentially locks a square into place, permitting players to build on it and chain together larger and larger combos. As Bursts can be triggered any time once the bar is at least partially filled, it becomes a delicate balance between wanting to use the mechanic as often as possible versus saving it for a clutch moment when you want to skyrocket your combo count and potentially skip through a majority of a track you might not want to listen to (which in Hydelic's defense, I couldn't find a single track in my modest demo session that I wouldn't mind hearing again and again).</p>

<p>Lumines Arise is one of those demos that kept lingering in the back of my head with the musical styling of Hydelic running through my thoughts with a few different renditions from the number of times I kept coming back whenever I had gaps in my schedule to get another run through the demo. In fact, my first playthrough of Lumines Arise's hands-on demo finished in roughly seven minutes with an S rank, although I didn't have the foresight to set up my capture card and record the run, so instead readers will have to settle for a not-so-smooth run captured below.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is currently on track for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR 2, and PC, with a free demo available later this Summer.</p>
