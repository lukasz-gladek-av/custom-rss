            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-models-textures-couldnt-processed-playstation-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will allow the game to shine, and some of its visual settings and features will scale beyond what was possible on PlayStation 5 with the appropriate hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a> regarding the game as a whole and its PC release coming next month, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the lighting rendering has been greatly adjusted for the PC version of the game, addressing one of the most common complaints about the PlayStation 5 release. In addition, the game will feature even richer 3D models and texture resolutions on high-end hardware that couldn't be processed on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC will also feature, as confirmed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">reveal trailer</a>, NVIDIA DLSS, and VRR support, alongside graphical presets perfect for those who do not want to tinkle with graphics settings too much. Further granular options will also be available, so the PC version of the second entry in the series should have way more options than those offered in the disappointing PC port of Final Fantasy VII Remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director also commented on mods, saying that the game won't have official mod support but that the development team welcomes user modifications, except for inappropriate mods, which the director asks modders not to make. Seeing how it went with Final Fantasy XVI, however, Hamaguchi-san shouldn't get his hopes up.</p>
<p>Unlike Final Fantasy XVI, whose additional PC features eventually made their way onto the PS5 release, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will not launch with anything of the sort, although the team did have to resist the urge to add new content. Originally, they wanted to add an episodic story as a new DLC, but ultimately decided that finishing the final game in the trilogy was the highest priority, also considering limited resources. However, if the team receives strong requests from players after the PC release regarding certain matters, most likely including the additional story DLC, they would like to consider them, so there's still the possibility of maybe being able to see Cid or Vincent in action before the launch of the third part of the remake, as was done with Yuffie with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">INTERmission DLC</a>, which turned out great.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5. The game launches on PC on January 23rd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online to Switch from Yearly Chapters to Seasonal Content]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As customary at the end of the year, ZeniMax Online Studios boss Matt Firor <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> a letter about the state of The Elder Scrolls Online, the popular MMORPG that just celebrated its tenth year of live service.</p>
<p>Firor discussed major changes coming to the structure of upcoming content. The team has focused on delivering annual expansions called Chapters ever since 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind</a>. They released the eighth this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold Road</a>, which added a new Scribing mechanics that allowed users to tweak skills/spells and three zones in the vicinity of Cyrodiil.</p>
<p>Gold Road will be the last Chapter released for Elder Scrolls Online, though. The team is changing its approach to new content, switching to a seasonal distribution instead. Firor said the Seasons might last anywhere from three to six months, featuring a blend of content like new stories, events, in-game store items, dungeons, and more.</p>
<p>2025 will be a transition year as the team shifts to the new model. As such, players can expect new zone-based content that has been in the works for some time, as well as 'some larger items.' According to the Studio Director of ZeniMax Online Studios, the new approach will allow the team to release more varied content more efficiently.</p>
<p>He actually went on to detail the specific areas of focus where 'experiments' will be conducted and evaluated based on community feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrodiil performance. ZeniMax Online Studios will be experimenting with a Cyrodiil campaign where all classes will have PvP-specific (and more performant) skills that replace the standard player skills with the expectation that we can support more players per campaign</li>
<li>Increasing the difficulty of standard overworld combat</li>
<li>Improving the overall feel of combat with animation, FX, and potentially audio work</li>
<li>Experimenting with more zones like Craglorn (although not as large in area or scope), created exclusively for high-end group and soft-group content with associated gear chase</li>
<li>Adding and refining tools to make guild recruitment, interaction, and management easier and more logical</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not all, as the development team also wants to improve the experience of new and returning Elder Scrolls Online users alike. Other objectives include a new PC patcher, improving the visuals of base game zones with updated textures and assets (this will begin rolling out next March), enhancing the game's PC UI, and other map and UI systems currently in the design/concept stage.</p>
<p>Overall,</p>
