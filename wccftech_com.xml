			<p>Nintendo finally announced the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond today during its Nintendo Direct presentation, confirming that it'll arrive this coming December 2, 2025 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The end is in sight for everyone who has been waiting for Metroid Prime 4 since it was first announced eight years ago in 2017, and even longer for those who've been waiting for this follow-up since the last Metroid Prime game released all the way back in 2007 with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</p>



<p>The trailer that was debuted today shows off more gameplay, and interestingly, shows Samus riding around what appears to be an open-world on a motorcycle, which is an element of the game that we hadn't previously seen in any gameplay trailers or game previews.</p>

<p>It's an added layer that makes the game all the more enticing. It'll be interesting to learn more about it as we get closer to release, but mostly, it's just good to finally have a release date confirmed for the game.</p>



<p>Leading up to its launch, Nintendo will release a retrospective look at the previous three Metroid Prime titles, and launch three new Amiibo figures ahead of launch, including one with Samus and her motorcycle featured in the above trailer.</p>



<p>When we checked out Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">earlier this year for a hands-on preview</a>, while it was just an early look, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote that, "<em>it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way</em>."</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, a remake of the seventh entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, will launch worldwide next year.</p>



<p>The remake, which won't be a port of the Nintendo 3DS remake released years ago, as some speculated when <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/">rumors regarding the game started circulating online</a>, will be a full 3D remake which seems bring the game's visuals, interface and combat system closer to the latest entries in the series, including the excellent Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. Surprisingly enough, it will also take not too long for the game to launch, as its release is set for February 5, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Despite Square Enix keeping its silence on Dragon Quest XII, fans of the series have plenty to look forward to in the coming months, as, besides Dragon Quest VII Reimagined next February, they will be able to experience the first two entries in the series with the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. Unlike the HD-2D remake of the third entry in the series, these two upcoming remakes will offer more than enhanced visuals and some quality-of-life improvements, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-preview-more-than-a-new-coat-of-paint/"> hands-on preview</a> based on a demo I tried during last month's Gamescom.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
