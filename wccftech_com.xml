			<p>More than <strong>1.5 million</strong> players jumped into the post-apocalyptic world of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> in the game's opening weekend, publisher and developer Rebellion announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The single-player survival action game that took the nuclear apocalypse to Britain arrived on current-gen consoles and, notably, Xbox's Game Pass subscription service this past Thursday, March 27, 2025. Which means it reached this milestone in just five days.</p>
<p>In a press release, chief executive officer and co-founder of Rebellion, Jason Kingsley expressed his joy about how the game has been received so far, saying "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</span></p>
<p>For years now, the most popular post-apocalyptic game about a nuclear war ending the world as we know it, Fallout, was always set in the USA. That's due mainly to Fallout always being a commentary on the United States, as Todd Howard explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">last year</a>, but that didn't stop fans of the series from wanting to explore a post-nuclear war world outside America's borders.</p>
<p>That's why we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a>, the Fallout 4 mod that overhauls the entire game to bring the flavor of Fallout from the US to the UK. Just ahead of Fallout: London's release, though, Atomfall was first revealed during Xbox's 2024 Summer Showcase, and now we have two variations of what post-nuclear war Britain looks like.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside, but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series," Kingsley continued. </span>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game."</span></p>
<p>While Atomfall is surely benefiting from the 'Game Pass' effect of having millions of players being able to just jump in and try it at no extra cost, even considering that, it's still an impressive launch for a new IP from an independent publisher and developer.</p>
<p>In our review of Atomfall, we praised the game for its narrative and approach to exploration, but as it stands just outside of launch, the experience is bogged down by a number of bugs and a few issues with the voice acting.</p>
<p>So it might be worth waiting for an update to jump in, but definitely still keep it on your radar, as we said "Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</p>

			<p>According to insider Tom Henderson, Assassin's Creed Invictus could launch in 2025. The leaker <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1906783248232923469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> a question on X about the upcoming spin-off game, saying that Ubisoft should release it this year.</p>
<p>The publisher only acknowledged its existence with a brief sentence <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/RQdGp9fytJeMffReMQpN3/fc14fdc4ed35de3550e1c94e250893a9/Ubisoft_FY23_H1_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2022's financial report</a> that followed the 15th anniversary of the franchise and its updated roadmap:</p>
<p><em>Additionally, a team, including For Honor veterans, is currently working on bringing back multiplayer to Assassin’s Creed with a standalone experience through Infinity under the project codename Invictus.</em></p>
<p>The only information we have on Assassin's Creed Invictus comes from leaks via <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xJ0nathan</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>. Both confirmed that it's a multiplayer game with an arcade feel inspired by Fall Guys and Smash Bros. Players would compete in multiple rounds across various multiplayer modes, such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, and some sort of speedrunning competition. There are also reportedly powers that characters can use to get a boost. The camera is said to be further away from the player character, while maps and characters from previous games like Ezio and Cesare Borgia will make an appearance in Assassin's Creed Invictus.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be an unusual experience, and it remains to be seen whether it'll be successful. Still, 2025 kicked off on the right note for Ubisoft with the strong launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> more than three million units in the first week, the second-best debut in the whole franchise after Valhalla (though that game launched during the pandemic and therefore had its sales boosted by the contingency).</p>
<p>There could be even more Assassin's Creed coming relatively soon, with the remake of the beloved fourth chapter (Black Flag) <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting a 2026 release. It was actually originally scheduled for November 2025, but that was before the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows. There was also a rumor about the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a co-op multiplayer mode post-launch</a>, by the way. There won't be any shortage of adventures in the franchise, that's for sure, especially following the creation of a new subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solely dedicated to the expansion of Ubisoft's biggest franchises</a> (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six).</p>
