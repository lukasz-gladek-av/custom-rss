			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, French developer Tactical Adventures announced the early access release window for Solasta II. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's turn-based tactical role-playing game</a> will be available on PC in early 2026 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, though details such as pricing and the estimated early access period haven't been shared yet. The studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned to launch this year</a>, but there has been a small delay.</p>



<p>Unlike the first game, which was powered by Unity, Solasta II features much better visuals thanks to the switch to Unreal Engine 5. You can still get a taste of that in the two-hour demo available on Steam. The downside to the engine change is that it likely won't be as moddable; the previous installment featured a level editor that brought forth a wealth of user-generated content, such as whole new adventures for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>In this sequel, which is still based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, players will embark on a quest driven by family legacy to the faraway continent of Neokos, where the ancient and enigmatic Shadwyn (voiced by Amelia Tyler, the narrator of Baldur's Gate 3) is corrupting the land. </p>

<p>According to Tactical Adventures, Solasta II stays true to its promise of delivering gameplay based on the world's most popular tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG): Dungeons and Dragons. But that's not all that Solasta II will have to offer. This new instalment will also allow players to roam freely across the lands of Neokos, exploring and uncovering the map as they wish. </p>



<p>The studio has promised to show off the new in-game overworld map for traveling between areas and answer fans' questions in a special Community Stream that will air on Tuesday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time (1 PM Eastern Time, 6 PM CET) via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TacticalAdventures/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>.</p>
