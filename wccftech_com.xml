            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Video games industry analysis firm DFC Intelligence has published an updated report on the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, raising its previous sales forecast from 15 million units to 16 million units sold by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>This is based on the fact that Nintendo tends to have a conservative approach in its forecast of a new product (which is 15 million units). With the original Switch, Nintendo had originally estimated to sell 10 million units but ended up selling 15 million. DFC believes Switch 2 could sell as many as 20 million units if the manufacturing could meet the demand for the console, but this is unlikely to happen, hence the 16 million forecast.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay of Grand Theft Auto VI</a> to May 26, 2026, DFC thinks that the Nintendo Switch 2 launch is even more critical for the industry, going as far as claiming that it's arguably the most important console launch ever. GTA VI would have significantly propelled sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series consoles, but with that factor gone for 2025, DFC now forecasts a decline in console video game software sales in both North America and Europe. North America is expected to see a 2% decline in 2025, with Europe anticipated to see revenue remain flat from 2024.</p>
<p>In the Far East, though, Japan is estimated to see a 25% uptick in console software revenue this year. That's mainly thanks to the aggressive pricing of the Nintendo Switch 2 on its home turf, where users can grab a region-locked version for ¥49,980 (around $342), a much lower price than anywhere else in the world. After adding Japanese sales, DFC forecasts global video game console sales to grow by 3% in 2025.</p>

<p>Overall, DFC Intelligence estimates that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would make it the leading console platform by far. As previously discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our interview with firm founder, CEO, and principal David Cole</a>, DFC believes Nintendo is positioning the new console as a primary gaming system and could potentially become the lead partner for several third-party publishers.</p>
<p>As for the industry as a whole, DFC expects GTA VI to help kickstart a new growth phase for the videogame industry between 2026 and 2029, setting new hardware and software sales records.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set to be a better-received game than its predecessor, but Hideo Kojima wishes it weren't the case, as he does not aim to create games that appeal to the mass market.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>, in the latest issue of Edge Magazine, the legendary game designer revealed that the second entry in the series launching next month on PlayStation 5 is doing much better in test reviews than its predecessor, but he wished it weren't so. Back with the original, Hideo Kojima did a lot of monitoring tests, and he found out that four out of ten people would love the game, while the other six would say that it would be a terrible game. This, Kojima-san noted, is a good balance, which Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is not striking, as everyone seems to be positive about the game. Sony is obviously pleased by the game doing so well in test reviews, but he wished it was a bit more controversial, as he is not interested in appealing to the mass market or selling millions of copies, although he recognizes that he can't afford to release a failure as he needs to take care of his studio and staff. But ultimately, Kojima-san wants to create something new that no one else has done before.</p>
<p>If I had been part of the original Death Stranding test reviews, I would have been among the four who thought it was a great game. While the game does have some issues, like the moment-to-moment gameplay sometimes getting dull, Death Stranding is among Hideo Kojima's best games, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">review</a>, so I can only be excited about what Death Stranding 2: On the Beach could offer to top its predecessor. Thankfully, it won't take long for anybody to find out, as the game launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">June 26th</a> on PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdMBChercPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode</a> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Creator's Voice interviews, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford heaped praise on the upcoming console, calling it perfect for Borderlands 4 and very powerful given the form factor.</p>
<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4. </em></p>
<p><em>The most exciting thing to me about the console is to see where we're going to go with this new connected world. Gaming is a shared social experience. It's why we, as developers, continue to make games that have adventure, but adventure with friends as well. The console makes that accessible to us as developers, to players, to our friend groups. Wherever they are in this weird, wild world, we can explore the Borderlands together.</em></p>
<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. As a game developer, it's awesome.</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and has promised a large and completely seamless world with no loading between areas. That the Switch 2 can fully support such a game is certainly encouraging, though not entirely surprising after learning that games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws are also coming to the platform.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4's release date has recently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought forward to September 12</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a> will debut on the market on June 5.</p>
