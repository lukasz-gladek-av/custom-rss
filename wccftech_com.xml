			<p>A new Black Myth: Wukong patch was deployed today on PC and PlayStation 5, introducing a highly requested feature, new content, PC-specific fixes, improved ray tracing performance, and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.0.12.16581, which started rolling out on the Epic Games Store version and will gradually become available on other versions of the game, introduces a highly requested in-game map feature, the Journeyer's Chart. The first map will be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper, while the others can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine every time a new region is reached.</p>
<p>The new Black Myth: Wukong also introduces new Challenges called Return of the Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. In the first one, which features three different difficulty settings, the Destined One will be able to challenge defeated opponents again; in the second, the Destined One will fight against opponents in quick succession using customized curses to tailor the difficulty and completing each gauntlet will reward players with new rare treasures. The patch also introduces a new armor set, the Armor Set of Opulence, to celebrate an early Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Together with a variety of gameplay fixes, the new Black Myth: Wukong also brings some PC-specific fixes that should improve the experience considerably, such as crashing fixes for NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, flickering fixes when using Intel XeSS, a memory leak fix, and more. The new patch also optimizes performance for numerous scenes and boss fights on medium and low-end configurations and enhances the performance of Full Ray Tracing on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. You can head over <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, GFA Games has finally provided a meaty update on their upcoming open world massively multiplayer first person shooter game PIONER. As you might recall, we interviewed the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-new-details-on-the-upcoming-stalker-inspired-mmofps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2021</a> and then a second time <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2023</a>, when the game was supposed to launch a beta testing phase. That never happened, but now GFA Games has confirmed that PIONER will launch next year on Steam<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, where the game is available for wishlisting.</p>
<p>There's a new trailer, too, along with an updated overview of the game's features, mechanics, and content. As previously reported, PIONER is set in an alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era and filled with atmospheric landscapes and unique architecture. The narrative is reportedly influenced by classic science fiction (specifically, we might add, GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER franchise</a>), featuring deep characters, powerful artifacts, and mysterious anomalies shaping the story. It will unfold over the course of a story-driven campaign through several quests that will delve into the setting's lore. Players will be able to align with charismatic factions, each offering distinct characters, viewpoints, and special rewards.</p>
<p>In PIONER, players will increase their influence by completing missions, defeating monsters, and exploring the world. More significant influence makes merchants more inclined to sell you better items, allow higher quality materials to drop, and even allow you to improve your non-combat abilities.</p>
<p>There will be various activities for the players to engage with, such as PvE missions, PvP arenas, events, and even mini-games like fishing and casino games. Moreover, the game includes an extraction shooter experience within the so-called Shadowlands. These are high-reward zones open to unrestricted PvP, where players can attack others freely, except for faction or clan members. The upside is that you'll find plenty of great loot here.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Wish" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq3Y2uxXHGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PIONER offers the opportunity to create clans. Members may communicate through chat and/or emotes, as well as competing on clan leaderboards. On the PvE side, there will be six raids at launch that reportedly mix open world and structured missions, providing a challenge that requires teamwork to overcome.</p>
<p>At its core, the game has some survival elements, too. Players must take care to keep hunger and fatigue at bay. There's also a crafting system where players use artifacts, anomalous energy, and scavenged materials to create new equipment. Lastly, there's extensive weapon customization with lots of unique designs and modules.</p>
<p>PIONER remains firmly on our radar. There aren't many upcoming MMOFPS games, and this one definitely looks worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 games will likely extensively use NVIDIA DLSS, but the most demanding titles may not be able to target 4K and 1080p output resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question asking about resolution output on the yet-to-be-revealed console during the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry made some interesting observations on what should be expected to see on the Nintendo Switch 2. For starters, there's no doubt that NVIDIA DLSS will be widely used as the system will be powered by a mobile chip that will be in no way on par with other current gaming systems, but its actual cost will make a difference in how it will be used. Based on the current version of the upscaler, there's a very good chance that in handheld mode, DLSS will target 720p or 900p resolution output, as the higher the output, the more expensive the upscaler gets. Generally, 900p, 1080p resolution output should be expected for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports in handheld mode, and 1440p in docked mode.</p>
<p>With more demanding current generation titles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will obviously struggle more, and developers will have to better balance output resolution and graphics settings. Generally, output resolution should be expected to be 720p or even below in handheld mode, and even in docked mode, it won't be very high, at least for third-party games. For first-party games, there's a good chance Nintendo could go for higher resolutions and simpler game content, an approach that would fit well with the company's current strategy and keep development costs low.</p>
<p>The balancing act mentioned above will be even more required to get Unreal Engine 5 games looking good on Nintendo Switch 2. At very low resolutions, UE5 games look rather bad, as Lumen, for example, gets very noisy. As such, some games will likely go for higher internal resolution at the cost of lower output resolution or significantly reduce visual settings. Given the system's small screen, however, the lower resolution may still look good enough and could not be a massive problem.</p>
<p>This analysis of the Nintendo Switch 2's potential capabilities could change dramatically, however, if the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler it supports differs from the PC version. For example, Hello Games implemented a lightweight version of AMD FSR 2 in the No Man's Sky Switch port, so it wouldn't be impossible for NVIDIA to have developed a lighter version of its upscaler optimized for the Switch 2 hardware.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but it shouldn't take <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-event-may-june-release/">much longer</a> to finally learn what it is actually capable of doing. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more information is available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
