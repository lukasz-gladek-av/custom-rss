			<p>Following the surprising <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a> for The Witcher IV, CD Projekt RED has begun sharing a few more tidbits about the already massively anticipated open world roleplaying game. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> more about Ciri's new role as the protagonist and who's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voicing</a> her in the new game.</p>
<p>While in Los Angeles for The Game Awards 2024, CD Projekt RED also joined Easy Allies for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thirty-minute long videocast</a> entirely dedicated to this reveal. To begin with, in case you had any doubts about the presence of the Gwent card mini-game, they've provided reassurance on that front.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gosia Mitręga (VP and Executive Producer):</strong> We really love the game and we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love. It's an amazing one. I don't think anyone will be disappointed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sebastian Kalemba (Game Director):</strong> Yeah, for sure. You know, it's a part of the experience.</em></p>
<p>The conversation then moved on to some of the elements that were glimpsed in the trailer, such as the magic chain summoned by Ciri and her new powers as a whole. On this topic, Kalemba said:</p>
<p><em>The chain is not only a utility tool that comes from the school of the Lynx, but also it's a pretty cool reference to the very first initial trailer we released 20 years ago for Striga, which was inspired heavily by a short story by Andre sap Koski where Geralt is literally using a silver chain to fight a Striga, so that's kind of a segue. That's one thing. The second thing, for those who don't know, Ciri is a pretty special being. She's a Source. That means that she has this Elder Blood, and she's a pretty powerful human. In this world, there's a magic, a Source that you can control and catalyze to create a spell, like Yennefer, Triss, or other mages in this world. Siri, as a powerful Source, after being mutated, is also able to use this magic, as Geralt could use Signs, which are like simplified magic.</em></p>
<p><em>Ciri is literally using energy. Actually, in The Witcher IV trailer, she's taking it out of the water, which is one of the elements that are part of the Source, so she's kind of extracting the energy out of this particular element and catalyzing it to create a bolt to build this opportunity window and defeat the monster.</em></p>
<p>The hosts from Easy Allies also asked about the game's adherence to the various endings players could unlock in the previous installment. Is the one in which Ciri becomes a Witcher the canon ending? Kalemba was vague on this subject, although it seems likely, given what we saw in the trailer.</p>
<p><em>We cannot tell you more right now, but definitely, we will refer to The Wild Hunt endings for sure, because we pay a lot of respect to the canon. For us, canon is Andrzej Sapkowski's literature and, of course, our games.&nbsp;This is one common world. The Witcher IV happens a few years after The Wild Hunt. Geralt will appear, and who knows who else.</em></p>
<p>In the videocast, the CD Projekt RED developers also teased an enhanced monster hunting experience that will be very much core to The Witcher IV. It was also confirmed that the village featured in the trailer, which is located in the far North, will also be in the game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there is no release date yet for the game. While we patiently wait, stay tuned to get all the latest rumors and news on the project.</p>

			<p>The new upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games for Horizon Forbidden West and Zero Dawn Remastered on PlayStation 5 Pro delivers image quality that is essentially on par with NVIDIA DLSS on PC, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>In their review of the PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the two main entries in the series developed by Guerrilla Games, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> also compared the new upscaling solution used by both games with the other major upscalers available on PC, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 3. Using a similar 1440p base resolution to upscaled 4K resolution, Guerilla's upscaling solution handles a variety of visual elements much better than NVIDIA DLSS, such as reflections on water surfaces and even motion, while NVIDIA's upscaler handles particles better. Compared to AMD FSR 3, the upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games in their titles on PlayStation 5 Pro does significantly better, as AMD's upscaler delivers blurry grass with a stationary camera and softer results in general.</p>

Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster PS5 Pro Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWaa0xNuelI?start=922&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given the excellent results this upscaling solution delivers, it's not surprising that Guerrilla Games skipped using the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler, whose implementation has been lackluster, if not outright broken, in many of the games updated to take advantage of the new system's features. As this upscaling solution was developed for future titles and then backported to the Horizon games, it will be very interesting to see the image quality it will be able to deliver in the future and how it will compare to future versions of PSSR, which will reportedly be much better than the one seen in action so far.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings more to the table than just the AI-powered PSSR upscaler. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
