			<p>The Dino Crisis series could be among the next classic CAPCOM series to be revived, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/lab/registros-de-resident-evil-requiem-e-dino-crisis-no-inpi-brasil/">Brazilian publication REVIL</a>, a new Dino Crisis trademark has been recently registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property. The July 3 filing is separate from the 1999 filing for the original and has been submitted around the time the Resident Evil Requiem registration has, suggesting that this new filing isn't meant for the updated PC versions of the first entries in the series released earlier this year, but for something different altogether. Interestingly enough, the trademark's class is the same as that used for the Resident Evil Requiem trademark, entertainment and video games class, so there's definitely the chance something related to the series is in the works, possibly a new entry in the series, a remake or even a remaster in the vein of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster.</a></p>



<p>The new Dino Crisis series registration with the National Institute of Industrial Property in Brazil isn't the only recent indication that the long-dormant series may be close to a return to the spotlight, following other series' revivals like <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Back in March</a>, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis again in Japan, which is usually done in Japan not just to protect rights to a property, but also when there's an intention to use the IP again. As CAPCOM did something similar with Onimusha, it looks increasingly likely that the series will be making some sort of comeback in the future.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, Dino Crisis made a small return <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">earlier this year</a> with the GOG release of the first two entries in the series. Both games have been updated with new features, such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more</p>

			<p>As Helldivers 2 launches onto Xbox Series X/S today, developer Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">debuted a deep-dive</a> into the upcoming Into the Unjust update, which will arrive on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S this coming September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>This new update doesn't just add new worlds for players to liberate, it adds a new flavor to the Helldivers 2 experience, sending players deep into the caves of these Hive Worlds where the Terminid enemy originates, where you'll be without the help of your Super Destroyer. You'll need to work together, even just to see the path ahead of you, as you'll need to coordinate between using your heavy-duty weapons and flashlights to see what's charging at you.</p>



<p>You'll have two new main missions to complete on these Hive Worlds. One is above ground and has you defending an oil rig that is mining oil on these Terminid planets for Super Earth to use on its mission to liberate the universe. The other is what has you going underground, as you try to move through the maze of caves to find the Hive Lung and destroy it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with new planets to explore, you'll face new challenges, with new mole-type enemies that burrow into the ground to try and catch you off guard when they pop up below you, and new dragon bugs. No, really, dragon bugs, called Dragonroach, that spews acidic bile from above you.</p>



<p>Arrowhead even teases a larger subterranean bug that they don't exactly show, but a short clip at the end of the deep dive makes them look like giant worms. We'll be sure to get a closer look at them next week.</p>



<p>With new enemies and challenges also comes new weapons and warbonds, namely the Dust Devils Warbond. There's also the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">Halo ODST crossover</a> that is technically the first time Halo content is available on a PlayStation device. The Halo ODST Warbond is available today, while the Dust Devils Warbond will arrive with the Into the Unjust update next week.</p>

<p>Into the Unjust is the most significant update to Helldivers 2 since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-out-now-fight-on-the-streets-of-super-earth/">Heart of Democracy</a> update earlier this year, and alongside the Halo ODST collaboration, a fitting way to ring in Xbox Series X/S players who are joining the fight for the first time.</p>
