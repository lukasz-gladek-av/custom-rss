            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Baxter, the D&amp;D based cooperative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in December 2023</a> by Starbreeze, has been canceled by the Swedish game developer. The news was <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared this morning by Starbreeze</a>, which is 'refocusing' on its owned IP, PAYDAY, according to CEO Adolf Kristjansson:</p>



<p><em>I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into PAYDAY and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on PAYDAY, we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.</em></p>



<p>Project Baxter was slated to launch in 2026, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in the pre-production phase in February 2024</a>, which made us skeptical at the time. The decision to discontinue this D&amp;D game might have been a mix of problems with the project and the desire to fix the PAYDAY franchise, which has suffered due to the poor reception of the third installment and, more recently, due to the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PAYDAY 2 subscription</a> and the simultaneous (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reverted</a>) price increase of the Infamous Collection DLC bundle. This cancellation comes with a write-off of a $27 million investment for the game and the decision to fire around 44 employees between internal developers and external contractors.</p>



<p>Perhaps at some point, we'll get a glimpse of footage of Project Baxter to see what could have been.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It happened in June</a>&nbsp;with the canceled D&amp;D open-world RPG that was in development at Hidden Path.</p>



<p>As a Dungeons and Dragons fan, I hope no more games attached to the franchise get canceled. There's still a healthy lineup on the way, between Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked (out in 2025), a new game from Invoke (the studio behind Dark Alliance), and an action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull. Last month, the president of Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confided that he'd love to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG</a>, though he also suggested it won't be happening any time soon, if at all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-producer-says-game%E2%80%99s-reception-was-unexpectedly-positive-but-future-games-won%E2%80%99t-necessarily-follow-this-formula.1314502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that even the developers of Silent Hill f did not anticipate such a positive reaction from critics and fans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on an IGN Japan livestream during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, producer Motoi Okamoto said:</p>



<p><em>I'm grateful that it was rated higher than I'd expected. I think you'll understand if you play it, but since it's a game with a lot of challenges, I thought there might be some pros and cons, but it's been very well received, and it has a Metascore of 86, the same as the Silent Hill 2 remake. Well, I was really surprised.</em></p>



<p>That doesn't necessarily mean future installments will follow the Silent Hill f formula, though:</p>



<p><em>We'll be putting out something different, with a different flavor. We want to explore all sorts of different aspects of game design and story.</em></p>



<p>Later, Okamoto clarified his statement <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a tweet published on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>As I said in the interview, not all future Silent Hill games will have the same gameplay as f, but rather I want the series to always be challenging in a good way, so that players can enjoy a different flavor of gameplay with each installment.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, there are some things that will remain the same, the most important of which is the quality of the story. I am convinced that a psychological story is essential to what makes Silent Hill unique, and I will continue to focus on that point and release future titles with confidence.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Award-winning game designer and writer Ken Levine, known for his work on System Shock 2 and the BioShock franchise, talked about the similarities and differences of those games with his next title, Judas, currently in development at Ghost Story Games.</p>



<p>In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published this week by YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, Levine claimed that while there are familiar elements (such as dual-wielding powers and weapons), Judas will be radically different in many ways. He also said it can be considered somewhere between BioShock and the first System Shock, meaning it's more complex and offers greater player expression and depth than the most recent BioShock titles.</p>



<p><em>There are parts of Judas that are more similar to Bioshock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different and it's nice to have some things that you're familiar with. I'm sure people noticed there's a gun in one hand and you got powers in the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much, but the way the game works and the way the game is populated and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. The way the story is delivered, too. It was good to start with some basis, but this is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since, you know, since I did BioShock. This is more of a departure in some ways than BioShock was to System Shock 2.</em></p>



<p><em>Judas is sort of somewhere between BioShock and System Shock, not between BioShock and System Shock 2, in terms of its depth. It's just a bigger game and a more complex game, but it's in service of doing something we started in BioShock Infinite, which is really how do you build a relationship with characters in games that feels way more granular than you normally see in games where you're really just making a few big choices, but really low-level reaction and commentary, being able to play people off of each other and feeling people getting angry at you and then being able to pull them back from the edge of that anger to and then maybe piss somebody off at the same time. That was what we're most interested in. Also, Infinite felt a little light to me on player expression, so we went back a little more towards player expression and build depth.</em></p>



<p>Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first discussed the 'narrative LEGOs' concept around ten years ago</a>. It wasn't until The Game Awards 2022 that Ghost Story Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled Judas as its debut project</a>, but fans had to wait until March 2024 to get a lot more info from the man <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a massive 75-minute interview featuring Geoff Keighley, Ryan McCaffrey, and Levine himself</a>. </p>



<p>In late August, Ghost Story Games shared the first developer log <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/388860/view/538863491448045972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, confirming that work had finished on the Villainy feature that will ensure emergent gameplay between the player and the game's three potential villains:</p>



<p><em>When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals.</em></p>



<p>Judas still has no official release date, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included it in the company's 2026 lineup</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Is a Profitable Business That’s Also Good for Creators, Says Xbox President]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-is-a-profitable-business-that%E2%80%99s-also-good-for-creators-says-xbox-president.1314448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Questions surrounding the profitability of Xbox Game Pass have existed for as long as Microsoft's gaming subscription service has been on the market. Ever since the launch of June 1, 2017, and increasingly more so over the years as Microsoft improved the subscription's value through various acquisitions such as Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, the widespread consensus was that it was 'too good to be true': an amazing deal for gamers, sure, but how long would even Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies on the planet, be able to sustain it?</p>



<p>Xbox executives such as Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-isnt-burning-cash-says-spencer-its-very-sustainable-and-continues-to-grow/">have repeatedly assured fans of the profitability of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and now Xbox president Sarah Bond has done the same once again in a <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2049598.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGS 2025 interview with Japanese website Game Watch</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last fiscal year, Xbox Game Pass sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a record high of $5 billion</a>. It's a profitable business, and as more creators join Xbox Game Pass, payments to creators increase, so we think it's a good business for creators.</em></p>



<p>However, in light of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's shocking news that the subscription service would now cost $29.99 on its Ultimate tier</a> (with hikes for the other tiers, too), fans have criticized Bond's statement. If it was already profitable and a good business for everyone, why did it have to be subjected to such a massive (+50%) price increase? </p>



<p>Granted, Bond conducted the interview a few days before this announcement, but as president of Xbox, it stands to reason she was absolutely aware of the incoming news. Taking her statement as accurate, the only plausible explanation is that it was not nearly as profitable as Microsoft would want, especially as it starts demanding more from the Xbox division after spending $75.4 billion on Activision Blizzard and $7.5 billion on ZeniMax Media/Bethesda Softworks to bolster the Xbox Game Pass lineup.</p>



<p>Even with all those big games on the subscription services, like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Diablo, and Call of Duty, the subscription service hasn't grown as much as Microsoft wanted (or like some analysts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Michael Pachter</a>, had estimated). If it can't have more subscribers, Microsoft seems to have decided it will now get more money out of those existing subscribers - only, it remains to be seen how many will remain at $29.99 monthly. Shortly after the announcement, too many requests <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelmed the web page where Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are canceled</a>. </p>
