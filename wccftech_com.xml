			<p>Injustice 3 might be on the way, as teased by MultiVersus dataminer MultiVerSusie. In a not-too-cryptic X post, they <a href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923533288137724173%7Ctwgr%5Ecad582adc9b8e13dcbc918ed0b0eb1a538f4db0b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Finjustice-3-is-rumored-to-be-in-development-1545223%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice</em></p>
<p><em>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</em></p>
<p>And then, just to make it even clearer:</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's worth taking this rumor with a big grain of salt. Still, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all. The previous Injustice games were big successes for developer NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Games, selling a lot of copies and garnering widespread critical and fan acclaim. By far their most appreciated feature was the story, which featured a gritty, unique take on the DC Universe where Superman falls into darkness after being tricked by the Joker into killing his beloved Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. Batman leads the resistance against his totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>There's no question that the Injustice games raised the bar for story and presentation in fighting games, but they were also no slouch in the gameplay department. The second game also added new features like the RPG-inspired Gear System that extended its longevity, particularly in the multiplayer modes. Injustice 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/injustice-2-justified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8.4/10 here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, Injustice 2 is surprisingly fantastic. Combat feels very weighty and satisfying, the graphics look incredible, characters look fascinatingly detailed and even the bass-heavy sound design is top notch. DC and fighter fans should definitely be giving Injustice 2 time.</em></p>
<p>It's been eight years, though, and fans have only had the mediocre animated 2021 film since. NetherRealm has released two consecutive Mortal Kombat games, so it could well be time to switch back to the DC-branded fighting game, especially since Warner Bros. has mandated a greater emphasis on its DC franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, James Gunn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the new interconnected DC Universe</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier this year to have met with both NetherRealm and Rocksteady about new DC games. It might be a while before Injustice 3 is announced, though, based on the DC heads' statements.</p>

			<p>According to insider eXtas1s, Microsoft has internally begun testing Steam integration within the Microsoft Store environment, intending to bring that to the next-generation Xbox console eventually. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZfAx5-EJRs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the latest YouTube podcast</a>:</p>
<p><em>Xbox + Steam are heading into the next generation, but steps are already being taken as Microsoft has just added the Steam application to the support software for its devices, appearing under the name of Steam Developer Beta. This, of course, is currently only available to certain employees and people who collaborate with Microsoft to provide support or develop certain things.</em></p>
<p><em>This is more than just a detail, because it logically reflects Microsoft's intention to facilitate coexistence and cooperation between its Xbox ecosystem and the gigantic PC platform that is Steam today. This integration will allow users to run Steam more smoothly and directly from Windows environments and, in the future, Xbox environments. I've been telling you that the next generation of Xbox is going to be more like a PC than a console. Everything is going to be developed around PC environments. Those logically need Steam integration and you'll have that in your Microsoft Store when you turn on your next generation Xbox console. This will allow you to have Steam on your Xbox console and on any Windows device without the need for complex configurations, which is a key step for the experience of the future console.</em></p>
<p>eXtas1s is not the first insider to talk about this eventuality. Windows Central's Jez Corden predicted the same a while ago, although in this case, eXtas1s claims to have sources indicating that testing for the Steam integration has already begun. As a reminder, the latest rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that the next-generation console strategy includes a successor to the Xbox Series X paired with a handheld device. Both should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027, with Microsoft attempting to launch ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6 after skipping the mid-generation console refresh that Sony released with the PS5 Pro.</p>

			<p>French game publisher and developer Microids has unveiled Syberia Remastered, a 'fully modernized' version of the classic point-and-click adventure game originally released in 2002. The game is scheduled to launch in the last quarter of 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Microids Studio Paris is working with Studio Virtuallyz on the project to remake not only the visuals but also tweak the puzzles and update the UI and controls, as detailed below in the official Syberia Remastered overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D. Every environment has been carefully rebuilt with an art direction that stays true to Benoît Sokal’s unique style, offering an even deeper immersion into his singular visual universe.</em></li>
<li><em>Enjoy a fresh take on the game’s intricate puzzles, redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience while preserving their essential role in uncovering the secrets behind Voralberg’s genius.</em></li>
<li><em>Rediscover Kate Walker’s journey with an updated user interface, improved 3D navigation, and more fluid controls tailored to today’s standards, all without compromising the game’s contemplative and narrative soul.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the story, protagonist Kate Walker, a brilliant New York lawyer, is sent to a remote village in the French Alps to conclude the sale of an old automaton factory. However, what seemed like a routine assignment soon turns into an extraordinary journey across Eastern Europe and its snow-covered landscapes.</p>
<p>Kate is accompanied by Oscar, a loyal and unique automaton. The duo embarks on an adventure to discover mysterious and forgotten places filled with eccentric characters. She ends up following the trail of Hans Voralberg, a genius inventor pursuing an impossible dream: to find the last living mammoths on the mythical island of Syberia.</p>
<p>Syberia Remastered isn't the first remake released this year by Microids. They also launched Amerzone - The Explorer's Legacy just a couple of weeks ago; Amerzone is set in the same universe as the Syberia games.</p>
<p>The most recent new installment in the franchise is Syberia: The World Before, which launched in 2022. The game earned a positive 7.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/syberia-the-world-before-review-a-return-to-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Syberia - The World Before is a return to form for the series, and an all-around solid adventure game featuring an engaging story that nicely blends together two different timelines, charming characters and good puzzle design. The experience, however, leaves something to be desired when it comes to innovation, making the game a must-buy only for fans of the series.</em></p>
