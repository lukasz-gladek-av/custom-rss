			<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the latest RPG from Owlcat Games and the studio's first attempt at delivering a third-person action RPG to players. It was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/">back at Summer Game Fest</a>, and today, as part of the Golden Joystick Awards, a new developer diary was showcased that reveals how the studio is looking to bring the world of The Expanse and space to life with the help of a former NASA astronaut.</p>



<p>Former NASA astronaut and ISS commander Leroy Chiao collaborated with Owlcat Games to help provide a realistic understanding of living and working in space and find ways around some of those realistic setbacks that would result in clunky gameplay that Owlcat Games knew players didn't want to deal with.</p>



<p>Like being constantly tethered to the ship while working outside of it, for example. Instead of players having to constantly watch out for a long leash, magnetic boots provide a smoother look and feel for players, without completely removing the constant threat that every astronaut fears when working outside the ship: somehow detaching and floating away.</p>

<p>The new dev diary also gave us a look at more gameplay clips for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, though much of those clips were cinematic and just followed characters around the ship. There was a small shot of some of the third-person cover shooting in space players will experience, but that's about it.</p>



<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is currently available to wishlist on PC and consoles, though there's no clear indication as to when it'll be available. Right now, it doesn't even look like it'll be out in 2026. In the meantime, though, instead of just watching the latest dev diaries over and over, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-gamescom-qa-mass-effect-suicide-mission/">Wccftech's interview with Owlcat Games at Gamescom 2025, all about the upcoming sci-fi adventure</a>.</p>
