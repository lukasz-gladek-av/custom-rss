			<p>Most years, when looking around at the best sports and racing games of the year, the list is dominated by annual releases, partly because they are sometimes the only sports and racing games to hit shelves in the last twelve months. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/">Our list for 2024's best sports and racing games</a></strong> can certainly be defined by that, but 2025 is a different beast.</p>



<p>In fact, 2025 was a standout year for sports games and racing games, the likes of which we're not used to seeing. With that said, let's dig into our top picks for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-8-5-10">Mario Kart World (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-MarioKartWorld.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World was the first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, Mario Kart World was an expansive return for the franchise and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">the major first-party Nintendo launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It brought the series out of its tried-and-true racing formula and put players into a vast open world, littered with collectibles for players to find, mini-challenges, and the chance to just drive over to every track included in the game.</p>



<p>Grand Prix race tracks are connected with long-winding roads, rather than the game cutting to a loading screen and lining up all of the cars at the starting track. You could now also control your vehicle like it's a Tony Hawk game, with grindrails and tricks impacting gameplay to such a degree that we've seen shortcut clips that would've previously only been possible by actually glitching through the game.</p>



<p>All of that sounds great, and for the most part, it is, but the big question around it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/"> whether it was worth $80 or not</a>, as Mario Kart World was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title to bump up game prices by another $10.</p>



<p>While only you can decided for yourself if a game is worth the price of admission, Wccftech's Nathan Birch summarizes the game quite well in his review, writing, "<em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4-8-5-10">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tony-Hawk-Pro-Skater-34-Review-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 rounded out the remasters for the first four Tony Hawk games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of doing tricks like Tony Hawk, 2025 also saw Activision round out the remasters of the first four Tony Hawk Pro Skater games with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, though this time it was Iron Galaxy at the helm of its development, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">after Vicarious Visions was swallowed up by Blizzard.</a></p>



<p>Though it's not exactly the straightforward remaster/remake in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was, due to how much about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was changed, it is still able to capture the fun of those skating games and provide more than a solid escape for anyone wanting to revisit those titles.</p>



<p>As I said in my review, "<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-8-10">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Racing-CrossWorlds-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds made 2025 the year of the kart racer.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yet another kart racer on the list, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arrived later in the year to try and give Mario Kart World a run for its money. Depending on who you ask, it did exactly that, as it is an incredibly fast game stuffed to the brim with character collaborations and the kind of structure kart racing fans are more used to seeing.</p>



<p>While Mario Kart World looked to try something new, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds went for tried-and-true methods and tried to polish them to a near-perfect shine. It may not have perfectly hit its mark, but it at the very least brushed Mario Kart in a way that Nintendo would do well to remember. Because the next time a Sonic game and a Mario Kart game go head-to-head, the plumber's reign may just be toppled by a blue blur.</p>



<p>Nathan Birch's review summarized how close Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds gets perfectly, writing, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-f1-25-8-10">F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F1-25.png"></a><figcaption><em>EA Sports F1 25. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The only annualized sports game in our top five list, F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-f1-26-not-happening-f1-25-major-expansion-f1-27/">which won't actually count as an annualized release next year since EA and Codemasters are skipping F1 26</a>), is able to inch into the list on the back of its established formula and known pedigree.</p>



<p>EA and Codemasters would have to actively sabotage the game at this point to turn out a bad one, and while it's a more than fair criticism to point out how little each new installment improves on the last when they are pumped out on a yearly basis, that doesn't diminish the overall quality on display.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray puts it in his review, "<em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-7-5-10">Rematch (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rematch-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rematch. Image credit: Sloclap</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The one entry on the list that isn't about what you can do on four wheels, Rematch, was a breath of fresh air in terms of the kinds of football games we're accustomed to. Sifu developer Sloclap took its experience in making extremely detailed, well-animated physical bodies that move with precision, and adapted that to a 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 arcade football game that plays like someone having the idea of taking the cars out of Rocket League and shrinking the ball down to the size a human would need.</p>



<p>Its launch was unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">marred by technical issues</a>, matchmaking problems, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">a lack of cross-play that was not announced until hours before the game would actually release</a>. It has improved on all of those fronts, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-crossplay-support-live-patch-3/">full cross-play support now included</a> and several bug-fixing updates having been pushed.</p>



<p>But it's unfortunate that these issues, along with a few issues with the UI/UX, caused it to stumble from the start, because outside of those problems, Rematch is arguably one of the best sports games to hit the market in years.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>



<p>The five games above are our top picks for the year overall, but there are still a few games worth mentioning that didn't make the cut. If you're a fan of sports and racing games, you would do well to check out these games too.</p>

			<p>Despite being a very niche genre, fighting games haven't been in a better position, but looking at the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/">games released this year</a></strong>, this wouldn't seem to be the case. <span>With the latest entries in iconic series like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/" target="_blank"><strong>Street Fighter</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank"><strong>Tekken,</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/" target="_blank"><strong>Guilty Gear</strong></a>&nbsp;continuing to receive support with new content and balance changes, there's obviously no reason for CAPCOM, Bandai Namco, and Arc System Works to launch new games.</span></p>



<p>Still, the few fighting games that launched in 2025 are all quality games. Whether you are looking to experience a brand new game or return to a beloved classic, these games have something good to offer you.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Despite being absent from the spotlight for a very long time, SNK's Fatal Fury series continued to be extremely popular among fighting game fans. After a long wait, the series returned this year with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and it couldn't have done so in a better way.</p>



<p>Besides featuring the unique two-plane combat mechanics of past entries, City of the Wolves ups the heat with the new mechanics, such as the Rev mechanics that can enhance special attacks, open up combo possibilities, and more. </p>



<p>With a wealth of single-player modes, including the RPG-like mode Episodes of South Town, a character roster featuring both beloved returning characters and newcomers (including some familiar faces from Street Fighter), Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is rightly considered by many to be the best fighting game released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko">2XKO</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2XKO_KeyArt_YasuoDarius_Final-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Riot's Project L has been a known entity for a long time, but it's only this year that the fighting game community has been able to go hands-on with the project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>now known as 2XKO.</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/">Having only launched on PC in an early access version late this year,</a></span> it's still too early to know if Riot's immense expertise in multiplayer games will be able to make a dent in the popularity of games like Street Fighter 6. Still, it's undeniable that, leveraging the iconic League of Legends cast, the developer is creating a compelling tag-fighter that is easy to get into thanks to simplified execution of special moves, and harder to master with its deep assist system and interwoven offensive and defensive mechanics.</p>



<p>With 2XKO launching next year on consoles, 2026 could definitely be the year for Riot's fighting game. However, even in its current state, the game is more than worthy of anyone's time.</p>



<h2 id="h-absolum">Absolum</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Absolum.png"></a></figure>



<p>Although traditional competitive games are the face of the fighting game genre nowadays, the resurgence of the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre continues at full speed, providing some excellent games, such as Absolum.</p>



<p>Developed by Supamonks and Guard Crush Game, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/"><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></a>, Absolum blends the same combo-oriented gameplay of the SEGA series revival with roguelike mechanics and procedurally generated levels, creating a remarkably satisfying experience with tons of replayability and an immense amount of depth thanks to the masterful crafting of each character's moveset.</p>



<p>While the game may be a little lacking in content right now (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673?l=english"><strong>though more is coming next year</strong></a>), Absolum brings a new spin on a classic formula that works exceptionally well, making it one of the best fighting games released this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Virtua-Fighter-5-REVO-World-Stage.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With fighting games being in a better place than in past console generations, it was baffling to see how SEGA was neglecting the Virtua Fighter series, one of the first franchises to guide the genre's transition from 2D to 3D. Thankfully, the Japanese publisher eventually came to its senses, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/"><strong>a new entry in the series is in the works by the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</strong></a></p>



<p>To bring back the franchise to a new generation of players ahead of the launch of the new game, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage-october-5-debut/"><strong>launched Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</strong></a>, an updated version of the latest entry in the series, complete with a single-player mode incorporating all the gameplay mechanics and tweaks introduced to the base game over the years.</p>



<p>Though not the new entry in the series fans expected, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage is a more than decent release to tide them over for the launch of a new generation game that promises to be the peak of the series.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-2.avif"></a></figure>



<p>Considering the current state of the genre, supporting more than a single fighting game is a real challenge for even big publishers like CAPCOM, which has been exclusively focusing on Street Fighter 6 since its launch in 2023.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the Japanese publisher hasn't completely forgotten about some of its older IPs, such as Capcom vs. SNK and Rival Schools, releasing them to the modern audience with the Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>



<p>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein, Power Stone and its sequel, the two Capcom vs. SNK games, Project Justice, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Capcom Fighting Evolution, the Japanese publisher has made it easier than ever to enjoy these classic games, hopefully with the intent of eventually reviving one of these series with new entries.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As already mentioned, 2025 didn't see the release of many new fighting games, so there are only a few more games worth mentioning. Still, they are more than worthy of a look.</p>
