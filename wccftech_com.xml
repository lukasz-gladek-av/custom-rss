			<p>AMD FSR 4 is a big leap forward for the upscaling tech, delivering better image quality than its previous iteration despite not reaching the same quality as NVIDIA DLSS 4 with the new Transformer model, according to a new comparison shared today.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their first look at the new iteration of AMD's upscaling technology, the first to be powered by machine learning and exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs. In terms of performance, AMD FSR 4 is heavier than FSR 3, as seen in the Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart opening sequence, where FSR 4 is around 8% slower than average using the settings at the Performance preset. The performance cost, however, is well worth it, according to Digital Foundry, as the new version of the tech addresses every major image quality issue of its predecessor, such as particle effects, which no longer sport massive ghosting, transparent surfaces, which show detail that was lost with FSR 3, quality of objects of low relative motion, which now sport improved surface detail. The biggest leap, however, is with complex motions, where AMD FSR 4 blows the previous iterations of the upscaler out of the water.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 isn't just a massive leap forward from previous iterations of the upscaler but also delivers better image quality than NVIDIA DLSS with the older CNN model in certain scenarios, such as with objects at rest or low velocity, where AMD's tech resolves more detail. Compared to DLSS with the new Transformer model, however, AMD FSR 4 falls short, as NVIDIA's tech clearly does a better job at resolving detail. With objects in motion, however, AMD FSR 4 is comparable to the CNN model, which is an amazing result considering how much FSR 3 lagged behind DLSS in terms of visual quality, providing RX 9000 series GPUs owners with a solid upscaling solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, AMD FSR 4 is exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT.
