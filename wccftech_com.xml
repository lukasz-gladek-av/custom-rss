			<p>Geoff Keighley's traditional Gamescom Opening Night Live returned this year to bring new game announcements and brand-new trailers for upcoming games, such as The Outer Worlds 2. The trailer provides an overview of the game's companions and playfully adds that players won't be able to sleep with them (Obsidian has previously noted that they'd rather not do romance at all instead of half-baking it).</p>

<p>Regardless of that, the sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obsidian's sci-fi first-person action roleplaying game from 2019</a> aims to be better in every possible way. The first The Outer Worlds game was, after all, made with a relatively small budget provided by Take-Two's indie-like publisher Private Division (now defunct). The Outer Worlds 2, however, was developed entirely after Microsoft acquired Obsidian.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the developers have decided to 'force' players into choosing a character build and sticking with it for a playthrough by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-wont-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing the 'respec' feature</a>. Game Director Brandon Adler said:</p>



<p><em>Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>



<p>The game also suffered from a bit of a controversy when it went into pre-orders with a $79.99 pricing. After plenty of protests from fans, though, Microsoft relented and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-price-has-been-reduced-to-69-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverted the base price to $69.99</a>.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 29, making it the third title launched by Obsidian this year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> and Grounded 2. On PC, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray tracing.</p>

			<p>One of the games we knew would appear at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> was Ninja Gaiden 4, and developers Team Ninja and Platinum Games did not disappoint with an incredible look at some unseen gameplay at this year's showcase.</p>



<p>The trailer was as action-packed as veteran Ninja Gaiden fans might expect it to be, and unsurprisingly looks like the series return to the action-game scene could be one of the best action games in the last decade.</p>



<p>While the trailer was another strong showcase of the gameplay in Ninja Gaiden 4, it also delved more into the game's story, and the adventure you'll undertake as Yakumo and Ryu Hayabusa.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Out of all the announcements featured in Gamescom ONL 2025, this is easily one of the most high-octane showcases. It's a good thing that we already have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">October 21, 2025</a>, release date to look forward to, as Xbox revealed the date this past June during Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>These kinds of trailers don't make the wait any easier though, since every new look at Ninja Gaiden 4 only increases the anticipation behind each day waiting for its upcoming launch.</p>



<p>At least if you're in attendance at Gamescom 2025 you'll be able to satisfy your anticipation somewhat, as attendees at the show can head over to the Xbox booth for a chance to play the game themselves during the rest of Gamescom week in Cologne.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Lands on December 17 – New Trailer Airs at Gamescom ONL]]></title>

			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, host Geoff Keighley brought on stage Fallout Prime Video producer Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet alongside stars Ella Purnell (Lucy) and Aaron Maten (Maximus) to talk about the second season of the show.</p>



<p>Geneva Robertson-Dworet said that the production team was excited to take the characters to some of their favorite locations from Fallout: New Vegas. Ella Purnell, for her part, commented that Lucy will have a hard choice on her hands once she finds her father: whether to bring him back to the Vault for justice, or to deal with him with another, much harsher brand of justice - the wasteland's. Another interesting theme in Fallout Season 2 will be to find out how much the Ghoul (played by the excellent Walton Goggins) will influence Lucy and vice versa.</p>



<p>As for Aaron, he pointed out that Maximus always wanted to become a Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel, and now that he has accomplished that, he may be facing the 'be careful what you wish for' type of situation.</p>



<p>The Ghoul, or rather Cooper Howard, will also appear in his human version before the war as he unravels a conspiracy. Of course, the cast did not just come to talk; they also brought the teaser trailer for the second season of Fallout, which will air on Prime Video on December 17.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer literally just dropped and fans are already raving about the many references to Fallout: New Vegas. Only time will tell if this new season will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as successful as the first one</a>, but here's hoping.</p>
