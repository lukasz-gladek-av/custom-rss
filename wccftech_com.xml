			<p>A few hours ago, the <strong>New York Videogame Critics Circle</strong> (NYVGCC) unveiled the winners of the <strong>2026 New York Game Awards</strong>, starting with Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which won the top prize of best game of the year.</p>



<p>It's yet another meaningful award for the highly acclaimed single player JRPG, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the win at <strong>The Game Awards</strong> last month</a>. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already surpassed Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the third game to earn the most GOTY wins, and the award season is far from over, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 well-positioned to win other prizes, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"><strong>D.I.C.E. Awards</strong></a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>, and our own Wccftech Awards, which will be announced imminently. It only lost to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>Steam Awards</strong></a>, although those were voted on by the public.</p>



<p>Anyway, the so-called '<strong>Big Apple Award</strong>' wasn't the only one that the French developer brought home, so to speak. Jennifer English was once again recognized for her work as Maelle with the <strong>Great White Way Award</strong>, which rewards the Best Acting in a Game. Here's the rest of the prizes that were given during the 2026 New York Game Awards:</p>



<p><strong><em>Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game<br></em></strong><em>Blue Prince</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Herman Melville Award for Best Writing in a Game<br></em></strong><em>Blippo+</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Statue of Liberty Award for Best World<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades II</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em></p>

<p><strong><em>A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game<br></em></strong><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High Line Award for Best Remake<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></em></p>

<p>This year's edition of the <strong>Andrew Yoon Legend Award</strong> went to a company rather than a person (last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was the recipient): <strong>The Pokémon Company</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>Marathon</strong> would launch in March, but not exactly when. An <strong>Xbox Store</strong> leak may have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgsa0y/marathon_release_date_discovered_on_xbox_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed it to be <strong>March 5</strong></a>, so at the very beginning of the month.</p>



<p>Later, an Xbox user even <strong>captured the pre-order trailer</strong> and posted it on Streamable. You can find it embedded below - hurry up, though, as parent company <strong>Sony</strong> is likely to issue a DMCA takedown soon. Anyway, there's a <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> that includes the so-called <strong>Midnight Decay bundle</strong> (two weapon skins) and more. No doubt, Bungie will share additional details when pre-orders open. It could be in just a few hours, as companies tend to follow up quickly on leaks to definitively confirm or refute the information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Marathon returns almost exactly thirty years after the previous franchise entry, Marathon Infinity. This new game is very different from the old ones, though. It's modeled after the growing trend of <strong>PvPvE </strong><span><strong>survival-extraction</strong>&nbsp;<strong>games</strong>, played in first-person</span> only. </p>



<p>In each session, you'll infiltrate the derelict colony of <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong>, a world whose inhabitants mysteriously vanished and is now contested by rival Runner crews and corporate security forces. Runners are <strong>bio‑cybernetic mercenaries</strong> who use a synthetic body built to survive extreme environments, hunting for weapons, upgrades, and valuable resources across repeated runs. </p>



<p>As with other extraction games, treats come from both NPCs (PvE) and other human players (PvP), <strong>making each session unpredictable</strong>. Additionally, Bungie has included <strong>dynamic events</strong> and <strong>environmental hazards</strong> that should keep players constantly on their toes.</p>



<p><strong>Successful exfiltration advances your character's seasonal power</strong>, earns cosmetics for your achievements, and lets you assemble stronger builds with the stolen loot. In Marathon, players customize their Runner's playstyle using weapons, implants, and equipment they collect.</p>



<p>The most recent official Deep Dive from last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">showed off the game's <strong>Runner Shells</strong></a>, or classes if you prefer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyer </strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin </strong></li>



<li><strong>Recon </strong></li>



<li><strong>Vandal </strong></li>



<li><strong>Thief </strong></li>



<li><strong>Triage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is a seventh Shell, the <strong>Rook</strong>, which can only be used in solo queues and has the advantage of coming with a free standard loadout, allowing newcomers to play without much fear of losing their own items.</p>



<p>The base game will be available at <strong>$39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99</strong>. The Deluxe Edition will certainly be more expensive, although we'll have to wait for the full pre-order announcement to know exactly how much. Marathon will be released on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X </strong>with full <strong>cross-play</strong>.</p>
