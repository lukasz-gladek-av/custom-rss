			<p>A few hours ago, modder xoxor4d released the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>. This public build even comes with a simple installer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, making it relatively easy for users to install it.</p>



<p>Xoxor4d shared a detailed changelog of improvements over the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod test build that was released last month. You can find it below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a basic installer</li>



<li>Removed alpha blending on some emissive surfaces that were not supposed to be alpha-blended</li>



<li>Night emissives now turn off during the day</li>



<li>Map markers can now be shown/hidden based on the time of day or the current weather</li>



<li>Added a button to teleport yourself to a map marker</li>



<li>Added a FreeCam mode and added a new Utilities tab to the imgui menu</li>



<li>Reduced the default emissive intensity of some surfaces</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that broke the remix debug views</li>



<li>No longer using timecycle temperature because it was not related to color tuning - now using a hardcoded value + reduced influence</li>



<li>Added a special remix replacement to the first apartment</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Remix Runtime</em></p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Added raindrops/splashes to wet world surfaces (disabled by default for pedestrians and vehicles because of varying UV scales, which makes raindrops really large on some cars and really small on others)</li>



<li>Added "puddle logic" to the global wetness code to break up the mirror-like surfaces</li>



<li>The <code>Ignore Lights</code> category can be used to disable the <code>WorldUI</code> texture tag that is automatically set on some emissive surfaces. This allows one to set custom emissive masks and tweaks via a remix replacement while keeping the dynamic intensity adjustment by the game</li>
</ul>



<p>The highlight of the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod is obviously that it injects path tracing into Rockstar's 2008 classic game. The result is a massive visual improvement, as you can see in the featured image and in the additional comparison screenshot below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GTA-4-RTX-Remix-Mod-PT-Comparison-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: MxBenchmark PC (YouTube)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, path tracing, like in any other PC game (and perhaps even more so in a mod that is not as well optimized as a full game for obvious reasons), is rather heavy on performance. As shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the MxBenchmark PC comparison video</a>, even NVIDIA's expensive GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card cannot run the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod at 60 frames per second without the help of DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Modder xoxor4d did have a couple of tips for those who may struggle with performance, though. Those who experience heavy stuttering can try to launch the mod using the included 'LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_2Cores_GTA4.bat' file. This will allocate two cores to GTA4 and the remaining cores to Remix. Another option is splitting your CPU cores 50/50 with NVIDIA RTX Remix; to do that, use the '_LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_Half_GTA4__Half_Remix.bat' file.</p>



<p>The path tracing settings can also be lowered a bit. Just like in every RTX Remix game, you can open the menu by pressing Alt + X. In the Graphics Settings Menu, switch to the Graphics tab and then adjust various quality settings in the Graphics Preset dropdown as needed.</p>



<p>Another tweak that might help performance (though it will also make leaves more blocky) is increasing the Tree Alpha Cutout Value. To do that, open the CompMod menu by pressing F4 and open the Rendering Related Settings container under the Game Settings tab.</p>



<p>Lastly, you can of course still tweak the quality and distance sliders in the regular Grand Theft Auto 4 graphics options. Keeping in mind that higher values will reach your CPU bottleneck earlier, the modder recommends starting with 50 for view distance and 30 for quality and adjusting from there. When making this adjustment, xoxor4d warned that the first launch might cause problems, but a second attempt should resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod can help Grand Theft Auto fans cope with the additional time they'll have to wait until the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> from the previous date of May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Rumors suggest Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-switch-2-explored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may even be trying to make the game run on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though even if that's happening, it would likely be launched at a later date.</p>

			<p>Another Black Friday, a whole new batch of deals for those patient players who were willing to wait for a good deal, and for Final Fantasy fans, or anyone wanting to see what all the fuss is about, that deal seems to be here. On Amazon, you can grab the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy (so far) for just $50.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade is the complete version of the beginning of this trilogy, including the base game and the Intergrade DLC expansion that Square Enix released for it post-launch. <a href="https://amzn.to/43TKIDV" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">You can grab it on PS5 right now on Amazon for only $20</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4pgPvHS" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">you can also grab it for PS5 on Amazon right now for only $30</a>. Some quick maths will tell you that for just $50, you can get the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, save for the third and final game in the trilogy, which Square Enix is still working on.</p>



<p>Development of which, according to Square Enix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">is coming along quite well</a>. It might still be a while until we find out more about the game, but it's good to hear positive updates from Square Enix on the game's progress.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Is Down to $35 on GameStop For Black Friday 2025]]></title>

			<p>Today is Thanksgiving in the United States, which is particularly significant for Americans. For the rest of the world, though, it means that tomorrow is Black Friday, and along with that come scores of deals available globally that players outside of the US care about as well, like the fact that you can now grab one of the hottest shooters of 2025, Battlefield 6, for just $35.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025" rel="sponsored noopener">IGN</a>, this is arguably one of the best Black Friday deals available for recent 2025 releases, especially when you consider that Battlefield 6 only launched on October 10, and a little more than a month later, it is available for half off. It was available at Amazon, but it very quickly sold out. You can still grab it at GameStop, however.</p>



<p>Here's both links to grab it for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://fave.co/4okc0KQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 PS5 - GameStop</a></li>



<li><a href="https://fave.co/4iJf56h" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 Xbox Series X/S - GameStop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is one deal you'll want to try and grab as quickly as possible, because it'll likely sell out or be removed before the weekend is up. It's an especially good deal if you've already been playing Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/">through the free trial currently ongoing this week</a>, because now you'll be able to continue the progress you've made.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around a month ago, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows, the latest mainline entry in the publisher's biggest open world franchise, would release on Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. The game's engine, the latest version of Anvil, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured many big improvements</a>, ushering the franchise into the next generation with technologies like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive ray tracing effects (global illumination and reflections)</li>



<li>Dynamic wind and rain driven by fluid simulation that affect trees, foliage, leaves, and even rainfall direction</li>



<li>Physics‑based, procedural cloud and weather simulation that continually evolves cloudscapes</li>



<li>Nanite‑style micropolygon system that virtualizes geometry, letting the engine render extremely detailed terrain and assets while smoothly adjusting triangle density with distance</li>



<li>Expanded destruction physics and improved cloth and material interaction</li>



<li>Overhauled terrain and asset streaming built around the aforementioned virtualized geometry system, keeping dense villages and varied topography loaded without hammering CPU or storage bandwidth</li>



<li>Deeper integration of GPU instancing and mesh shaders to cut CPU submission overhead and render many small objects efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 platform, however, is far less powerful than the platforms on which the game was first released on (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). According to Ubisoft's Project Lead Programmer Bruno, the developers had to fundamentally redesign how the world is rendered and even how the game systems of Assassin's Creed Shadows interact with each other.</p>



<p>Core simulation systems like clouds and cloth are preserved but heavily optimized and sometimes downscaled to lower GPU load, while global illumination uses the baked solution already employed on low-spec PC and Xbox Series S to save RAM rather than relying <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the console's hardware ray tracing support</a> to deliver ray traced GI.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Ubisoft had to extensively tune down every parameter (LOD, draw distances, texture resolution, and object streaming) per scenario, reducing NPC counts only where necessary in dense hubs to uphold performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The developers leveraged the Nintendo Switch 2's support of NVIDIA DLSS to reconstruct a sharp image from a lower resolution base, thus accelerating performance. Ultimately, however, Ubisoft settled on achieving a stable 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes. The difference, then, lies in the visual quality, which is further diminished in handheld mode, whereas docked mode offers improved image quality, increased draw distance, and more refined LOD settings.</p>



<p>The handheld mode does have a few tricks up its sleeve, such as HDR support and a tweaked implementation of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). Bruno explained:</p>



<p><em>The lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 FPS, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. We didn't want to compromise on that aspect, and so we built a dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 FPS, keeping the game as fluid and responsive as possible.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft is leveraging a few platform-specific features for this version of the game, such as touchscreen support for menus, maps, and hideout interactions. There are also plans for future mouse and keyboard compatibility in docked mode.</p>

<p>On December 2, players won't be able to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-unremarkable-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, which is coming at some point in 2026 to the Nintendo Switch 2. On that note, Ubisoft also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that it'll be the only major expansion coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, unlike the previous entry, Valhalla, which got three (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-of-politics-and-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrath of the Druids</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Siege of Paris</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-the-end-of-an-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of Ragnarök</a>).</p>
