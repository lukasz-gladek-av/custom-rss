			<p>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games is hiring Cinematic Animators at two of its five global offices (<a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/frankfurt/cinematic-animator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/uk/cine-anim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manchester</a>), with the specific request that candidates have prior experience developing for current/next-generation consoles.</p>
<p><em>As a Cinematic Animator, you will be part of a team of Animators and Cinematic Designers dedicated to bringing to life the performances of some of the best actors in the industry and tying them into the Squadron 42 narrative. You’ll be developing scenes with multiple branching options, deep and emotional narrative, and exciting action. </em><em>Founded in 2012, Cloud Imperium Games creates cutting-edge videogames that defy expectations. We’re currently developing Star Citizen, a record-breaking multiplayer online space sim, and Squadron 42, a cinematic single-player adventure set in the same universe.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Professional experience in game animation development, ideally on current/next-gen consoles.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fans have taken this as a potential indication that Cloud Imperium Games intends to port Star Citizen, or at least its single player campaign Squadron 42, to consoles such as Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p>So far, CIG hasn't announced any console port. Indeed, the two games have been proudly developed from the beginning only for PC, with Game Director Chris Roberts openly stating that the incredibly ambitious project would only be possible on this platform.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider that it's been a long time since those early days. Consoles have made great strides since, and what was once cutting-edge technology that could not run on PlayStation 4/Xbox One may be feasible on PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X, or at least on their successors, which should launch between 2027 and 2028.</p>
<p>After many years of development, Squadron 42 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a 2026 release window alongside a new gameplay demo during the latest CitizenCon event. The campaign will feature high-profile actors such as Gary Oldman, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Henry Cavill, Ben Mendelsohn, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Liam Cunningham, and Gillian Anderson.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, a report <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-dev-has-reportedly-lost-integral-staff-on-server-meshing-team-hit-with-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Cloud Imperium Games had recently lost key staff with expertise in 'server meshing', a feature that the developers has described as one of the 'key technologies to get the jump points working in-game by allowing star systems to seamlessly move in and out of memory without the need for loading screens'.</p>
<p>This wouldn't affect Squadron 42, since it's single player, but it could damage Star Citizen. We reached out to CIG about that report, but have received no response so far.</p>

			<p>Bungie's revived franchise, Marathon, hasn't experienced the smoothest development phase, to say the least. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> in May 2023, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2025 partly because of Bungie's layoffs.</p>
<p>In 2024, news spread that Game Director Christopher Barrett had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired</a> for misconduct and would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by the former Valorant Game Director, Joe Ziegler. That's also when insiders like Tom Henderson started relaying negative vibes about the game's future from their sources.</p>
<p>Last month, Bungie suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a release date, setting Marathon to debut on September 23, 2025 while also showing off more gameplay footage. However, just last week, another scandal erupted: Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game had used assets taken without permission from artist Antireal. They admitted their fault, said the assets would be removed, and added that they would 'make things right' with the artist, presumably through some sort of compensation.</p>
<p>It is amid this uneasy climate that the rumor of a potential Marathon delay lands very loudly. In the latest episode of his Sacred Symbols + podcast (currently paywalled <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-129769084?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Patreon</a>), former IGN journalist Colin Moriarty claimed:</p>
<p><em>I was told by someone familiar with marketing plans in a key overseas market that there are now no plans to do paid marketing for Marathon at all. I don't know if those plans were affected by what has recently happened or if that was always the plan or whatever, but it is considered a fairly unusual move for a game of this high profile.</em></p>
<p>Of course, readers should take this information with a big grain of salt for the time being. We'll have to wait until we hear from Sony. One thing is for certain, though: neither Sony nor Bungie can afford another live service failure. Sony already had the fallout of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord's $200 million failed expenditure</a>, not to mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, while Bungie suffered several rounds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and recently had former developers openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking out against the studio's leadership</a>. If the delay can help, it's definitely the right choice.</p>
<p>Marathon will be launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with full cross-play between all platforms. The sci-fi first-person PvP extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't be a full-priced title</a>, so it should be priced around $40 or $50 at the most.</p>
