			<p>In their <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2jOPqNEzotGX0odqDUt5jr/57f0ba952c3be14b38ba97a02b17c119/Ent_AGM_2025.07.10_URD_GB_Interactif_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual financial report</a>, Ubisoft made a statement that no doubt already has many gamers riled up. On page 10, while discussing the Group's Business Model and Strategy, they go out on a limb to say that microtransactions make premium games more fun.</p>



<p><em>The adoption of monetization and engagement policies that respect the player experience and are sustainable in the long term. At Ubisoft, the golden rule when developing premium games is to allow players to enjoy the game in full without having to spend more. Our monetization offer within premium games makes the player experience more fun by allowing them to personalize their avatars or progress more quickly, however this is always optional.</em></p>



<p>Most hardcore gamers are, however, fiercely opposed to this monetization practice. While microtransactions are understandable to an extent in the context of a free-to-play game that has to generate some revenue to keep the game running, the same cannot be said of a premium game, which by definition already has an intrinsic access cost for the consumer.</p>



<p>This is not at all a newly implemented practice by Ubisoft. The publisher first introduced microtransactions in their premium games with 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. As they say in the quote above, they're entirely optional purchases that offer mostly cosmetics, like unique-looking mounts, armor, and weapons, as well as some powerful weapons with strong stats (but others just as powerful can be acquired simply by playing the games). They've been in practically every Ubisoft premium game released ever since, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>. Still, this statement, although clearly aimed at investors, will do nothing to improve the publisher's reputation among hardcore gamers. </p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, we just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the recently established subsidiary (partially funded by Tencent) would be co-led by Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, the former head of the publisher's North American studios.</p>

			<p>During TennoCon 2025 (the tenth edition of the community event), Digital Extremes announced what's coming next to Warframe, its popular free-to-play third-person online action game.</p>



<p>Later this year, Warframe will be updated with a new Narrative Chapter titled 'The Old Peace'. It will usher players into the past, where they will relive the long-forgotten tale of Tau and his childhood friend, Adis, and the war between the Orokin and their creations, the Dax Anarch Warriors (a new enemy faction), on the Perita moon. This quest will be operator-focused, in case you were wondering. The Old Peace continues Warframe's current “Void War” story arc and sets the stage for the monumental Tau Narrative Chapter, coming at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>Alongside The Old Peace, the developers will also add a new side story titled 'The Devil's Triad'. In this narrative, players will welcome a new trio of characters: Father Lyon Allard (Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (Protoframe of Wisp), and Uriel (the new devil-themed Warframe).</p>



<p>Digital Extremes also unveiled the Operator's graphically remastered character models and cosmetic assets to improve visual fidelity, including new facial animations, and align with Warframe’s latest assets. Last but not least, a new Ultimate ability will be introduced for the Operator. More details about this will be revealed later.</p>

<p>The developers then moved on to the untitled Fall update that will debut in a few months. This patch will continue improving the new player experience in Warframe, with a new Mod tutorial Quest, The Teacher, developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital. The 62nd Warframe, a long-awaited Oberon rework, a fresh Lavos deluxe skin, among other quality-of-life improvements, are scheduled to be released with this update, too. More details will be provided in the September live stream.</p>



<p>The Android closed beta for Warframe will also arrive this Fall. Sign-ups for the closed beta playtest <a href="http://warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are available now</a>. </p>
