			<p>Obsidian Entertainment's latest role-playing game, The Outer Worlds 2, is here, and there's a lot to do in this new space-faring adventure. The planets you visit have bigger maps to run through, there are more weapons to use and modify, people to meet and talk to, and plenty more.</p>



<p>But there are five things that you should absolutely do first, right when you get off your ship, the Incognito, and touch down on the planet Eden and on Paradise Island. They'll make your playthrough run a lot smoother, and start you off on the right foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-guide-do-these-five-things-first">The Outer Worlds 2 Guide - Do These Five Things First</h2>



<h3 id="h-get-the-double-jump">Get the Double Jump</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration is a key gameplay element in The Outer Worlds 2, and it becomes a lot easier once you unlock the ability to double jump, which you can do almost immediately when landing on Paradise Island. </p>



<p>It starts by finding Heull Chaundry, a down-on-his-luck Auntie's Choice businessman who was kicked out of the saloon in Fairfield for not being able to pay his tab. Speak to him, and start his sidequest. That'll put you on the path to discovering the P.A.L.E. Boots, which let you double jump.</p>



<p>If you don't speak to Heull or investigate where Ida Rutledge is hiding as you continue through the first major quest of getting into the Vox Relay, then you won't head to Spire Grove, where you can find the boots. Otherwise, you'll run through the whole game without being able to reach certain additional areas, and miss out on extra resources, weapons, armour pickups, etc.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-a-plasma-shock-biomass-weapon">Get a Plasma/Shock/Biomass Weapon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elemental damage is huge in The Outer Worlds 2. It's far more important to pay attention to weapons that have elemental damage than just their overall damage output. That's why you want to have one in your arsenal as soon as possible. </p>



<p>Whether you choose Shock, Plasma, or Biomass (though personally I'd recommend Shock or Plasma to start), your elemental damaging weapon will be the best weapon in your loadout and help you tear through combat encounters without issue, even when you're just starting out.</p>



<h3 id="h-grab-the-commando-perk-add-an-extra-holster">Grab the Commando Perk/Add an Extra Holster</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can only choose so many perks on your way to level 30, which is as high as the levelling system goes in The Outer Worlds 2. You don't get to pick a new Perk with every level, so you have to really think carefully about which ones you choose.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is an RPG, and there's technically no wrong answer, but one of the first perks you should pick up, if not the first one, is Commando. It'll unlock a third holster in your loadout, letting you carry three weapons at a time instead of two.</p>



<p>If you don't want to pick Commando, you can still unlock that third weapon holster with the 'Extra Holster' helmet mod that's available at the first vendor you'll find in Fairfield. If you pick Commando and equip a helmet with the Extra Holster mod, you'll be able to carry four weapons at a time.</p>



<p>Whichever way you do it, you'll be far better off with at least three weapons on hand instead of two, since it leaves enough room for weapons with different ammo and damage types, giving you options in combat without having to dig through the menu to switch weapons mid-fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-buy-ammo-crafting-recipes">Buy Ammo Crafting Recipes</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll always be able to buy whatever ammo you need at vending machines and vendors in towns, but you might not always have a vending machine nearby when you need it. There might be a workbench, or you might have Niles in your party who is essentially a workbench on the go, but nowhere to buy ammo.</p>



<p>That's why you need to buy crafting recipes for different ammo types as soon as you see them. They should be the first things you buy, even before a new weapon or a new piece of armour. Crafting ammo is only possible if you have the recipe in the first place, so buy all the ammo crafting recipes for the starting ammo types once you make it to Fairfield. Also, as new ammo types appear the deeper into the game you get, make sure to grab those recipes as they become available.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-toxicity-draining-armour">Get Toxicity Draining Armour</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Inhaler is the only method of healing you have while in the middle of a fight, even if you have swaths of food resources that can heal you. You can't eat mid-combat, so those resources can't help you. You have to use your Inhaler, but using it increases your toxicity levels.</p>



<p>Those levels decrease over time as the toxicity drains, but the time you wait can be the difference between surviving a fight or not, depending on if you're able to get to cover quickly.</p>



<p>Your toxicity can drain faster than the standard rate, and the easiest way to do that without putting points into skills and perks that'll help with your toxicity drain is by wearing armour that increases your toxicity drain. This is a feature you'll be able to find with certain helmets, and it's worth wearing them for this exact reason.</p>



<p>Also, it's worth it to get better armour in general. Your starting armour isn't very protective, and whether you buy it from the vendor in Fairfield or take it off a corpse, you'll want to grab new armour as soon as you can to help you survive.</p>

			<p>The Halo: Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">we've all been anticipating today</a>, as part of the Halo WCC, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">has finally been announced</a>. Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake that Halo Studios and Xbox describe as "<em>a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign</em>." It'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>We've officially seen it all now, with all of Microsoft and Xbox's biggest first-party franchises making their way to PlayStation. It was the inevitable endpoint we all saw when Halo Studios (formerly 343 Studios) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-halo-infinite-impact-vision/">dropping the Slipspace Engine and moving to using Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>It's both exciting and surreal to see Halo making its way to PlayStation for the first time. You can check out the trailer for the remade campaign, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what's new in this remake, the answer is pretty much everything, since all of the assets, models, environments, everything has been redone and retooled for Unreal Engine 5, and to take advantage of all the features that engine brings along with it that Halo Studios couldn't do within the Slipspace Engine.</p>



<p>There are also three brand-new bonus missions that act as a prequel setup to the main campaign. The actual Combat Evolved campaign hasn't been changed with regards to how the story goes, these are new missions to give players a bit more than just a remake of the campaign.</p>



<p>Campaign Evolved also introduces four-player co-op for the whole campaign, letting you play through the campaign with three other people online. Also, even though Halo Studios never got it done for Halo Infinite, couch co-op is available for Campaign Evolved for two player co-op.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | Roundtable Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-tXi1NC_aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the trailer, and the above roundtable, which shares a little more about why Halo Studios went forward with Halo: Campaign Evolved at this point in time, we also got a full 13-minute gameplay showcase, which shows off the The Silent Cartographer level towards the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer – 13 Minute Gameplay Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what this new remake doesn't have, the big aspect missing that should be obvious, given the title of the remake, is that it doesn't include the game's multiplayer. It's just the campaign. If you want to play multiplayer in the style of Halo CE, then the Master Chief Collection remains your best option.</p>



<p>All things considered, this remake definitely looks impressive at first glance, but a huge element of what made Halo unique was how the game felt thanks to the Slipspace Engine and everything that Bungie got right about what makes a good first-person shooter all those years ago. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react when they get their hands on it at some point next year.</p>



<p>For now, you can wishlist the game on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
