			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s5teaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Embark Studios announced</a> that Season 5 of THE FINALS will be launching on December 12. In this season, there will be a new map, gadgets, weapons, social clubs and sponsors to help spice up the game. This season takes players to the mountainside town of Bernal, which is home to one of the biggest monoliths in the world. This arena features historic cobblestone streets with a vibrant and colorful colonial plaza as the centerpiece of the map. Players will be able to leap across rooftops to find secrets in the nooks and crannies of the map while fighting for survival against their opponents. There are destructible environments to add to the spectacle of the fight, allowing you to strip away Bernal's historic charm and instead turn it into a bullet-ridden ruin.</p>
<p>Embark Studios has released a new trailer for the upcoming season, so that you can see what you can expect from the new season in THE FINALS on December 12.</p>
<p><iframe title="THE FINALS | Season 5 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9TekVsp_UE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This season also adds a new way for players to connect with each other. The feature is called Clubs, and is a social system that is inspired by real sports teams. Regardless of whether you're playing solo or you're in a squad, Clubs allow new ways for players to connect with each other, collaborate, or compete. By utilizing Clubs, Contestants can work together to complete challenges as a team using Club Contracts. This will allow you to earn XP and fans, or you can use Team-Up Requests to find teammates for your preferred game mode.</p>
<p>That's not all that players can expect to see in THE FINALS Season 5, as there are some new weapons, including the ShAK-12 and Cerberus 12GA, weapons for the Heavy and Medium classes respectively. Along with weapons being added, there are some new Gadgets, including the Gravity Vortex and Lockbolt Launcher, for the Light and Heavy classes, respectively.</p>
<p>Fan favorite sponsor ISEUL-T returns to Season 5 of THE FINALS, and two brand-new sponsors, DISSUN and VAIYA, join the roster of sponsors. This season, THE FINALS launches on PlayStation 4 for the first time, allowing a whole new audience to experience the game that weren't able to previously. Of course, while there are new items and features being added, Embark Studios has also worked on balancing the game and weapons as needed while adding quality-of-life improvements. Players can now expect support for a 120Hz mode on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series</a> X, allowing those on the console to experience the new season of THE FINALS in a smoother performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty takes the top spot in revenue for the month of October across PC and console, as <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Newzoo</a>. It's not just Black Ops 6 that has boosted the revenue, as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II &amp; III, as well as Call of Duty Warzone, have all contributed to the revenue earnings, helping the franchise take the top spot. In terms of engagement, Call of Duty also did very well for itself, and Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">had the most successful launch</a> in the history of the franchise. This is helped by the fact that Black Ops 6 was a day-one release on Xbox Game Pass for the first time ever, helping many people get the opportunity to play the game without having to pay the hefty price tag for the game.</p>
<p>While Call of Duty did take the top spot for revenue and second place for engagement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/">Fortnite</a> continues to retain its position as the most-played game across all platforms. It's likely that we will see Fortnite continue to retain this position in November's report, too. This is because the latest chapter of Fortnite has just been released, meaning there is a ton of new content for players to explore. Additionally, they recently just made the change to battle passes that allows players to get all of the battle passes for a single price, rather than paying for them separately.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">Roblox</a> is also on both the engagement and revenue top 20. Roblox takes the third position for engagement on all platforms. Considering that this year saw a rise in influencers and streamers playing the game due to the release of Dress to Impress, it's not surprising that the game shot up in the rankings. With the release of that particular experience, gamers of all ages have been flocking to the platform to give the game a go. On top of that, celebrities have also been making appearances in the game, with K-pop groups and singers such as Charli XCX having their own collaborations or meet-and-greet events.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, two Blizzard Entertainment titles managed to make it onto the top 20 list. World of Warcraft shot up by 138 ranks, securing the third position in PC revenue, which was predominantly driven by the 20th Anniversary Celebration and the release of new content from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within expansion</a>. Additionally, Diablo IV saw a significant boost in revenue thanks to the expansion, Vessel of Hatred being released on October 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gamers-spend-more-time-watching-videos-than-playing-games-midia-research/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/the-case-for-in-game-video-platforms-closing-the-direct-to-consumer-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research's upcoming report</a>, they've concluded that gamers spend more time watching videos on platforms like <a href="https://wccftech.com/detroit-become-human-has-sold-over-5-million-units-community-play-twitch-extension-reportedly-very-popular/">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-videos-skipping-till-end-if-you-have-adblocker-enabled/">YouTube</a> rather than playing games. In the report, it says that there is an 'untapped potential' for game publishers to have video content from inside their ecosystems to third-party platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. The report says that gamers are now spending more time watching videos, averaging 8.5 hours per week on video versus 7.4 hours gaming. Although there are plenty of games to be played, it isn't too surprising that a lot of people watch games instead. Whether this be from watching streamers play their favorite games or watching streamers take on horror games so they don't have to, video content is overall just a tiny bit more popular.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>24% of console and PC players watch game-related videos at least monthly, with 48% of in-game buyers watching game-related content at least monthly. The report shows that a common factor is that those who view content tend to be high-spending gamers, especially when it comes to microtransactions. As a result, the report suggests that there is an open market for in-game video platforms to offer publishers a direct line to the highest-value fans.</p>
<p>For a lot of popular games, it may be a little bit difficult to pull something like that off, but eSports would be a great way to attempt to bring video content inside games, especially considering how often events happen within eSports and Fighting games, for example. By doing this, it would allow publishers to unlock new revenue streams in the process, something that publishers are struggling with when third-party video platforms exist.</p>
<p>This is something that has the potential to be revolutionary, especially at a time when the game market is facing growth stagnation and competition across all genres is at an all-time high. Especially for those living in areas with significant economic crises, it means that people have to choose what game to purchase rather than purchasing multiple.</p>
<p>"It's time for game publishers to think about in-game video as something beyond marketing alone. By reclaiming video engagement, publishers have the potential to unlock new revenue streams like advertising, and drive growth," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MIDiA Research, the author of this particular report.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1050750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/main/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Abyss</a>, the developer and publisher of Black Desert has announced that they are officially developing native builds of the game for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S. These native builds will offer enhanced visuals, smoother gameplay, and much-needed performance upgrades to make sure that the game runs smoothly and is tailored to next-gen consoles. This update will be free for all current Black Desert Console players.</p>
<p>If you prefer to get your news in the form of a video, General Manager Matt goes into detail about what you can expect from the console updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Message from Black Desert Console Team" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oW6Ra1fNzwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it stands, the PS5 version's development has been completed and is nearing platform certification, while the Xbox Series X development is currently ongoing. Pearl Abyss plans&nbsp; for both of the builds to launch in the first half of 2025, when there will then be additional updates to Black Desert Console, like the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>In addition to the native build development for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it's been confirmed by Pearl Abyss that there will be a ton of updates coming to Black Desert on December 12 to help keep players engaged in the interim between the native build release and the release of the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light expansion</a> was released earlier this year on PC and took players to a new region of ancient Korea, with lots of stunning visuals, traditional Korean architecture, and beautiful scenery. The expansion is free for all players. The most common complaint about the expansion is that the amount of information thrown at you is overwhelming, especially if you are a new player in the game.&nbsp; Additionally, combat, which is a vital part of Black Desert, wasn't really explained as much in Land of the Morning Light, and those who had never played the game before would find it a bit of a struggle to figure out the systems.</p>
<p>On December 12, Kharazad Accessories will be added to the game, as well as an Accessory Exchange System that allows players to exchange parts of the Deboreka accessory set to get other parts of the set that they may need.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be daily rewards and buffs to help players through the grind. Beneficial items like Mythical Censer and significant buffs that are added to the game will be running until March 2025. This includes a 50% buff to Training EXP, a 100% buff to Farming EXP, and Combat EXP being buffed to 500%.</p>
