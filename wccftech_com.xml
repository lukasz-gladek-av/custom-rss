			<p><strong>Highguard</strong> has become one of the most talked-about games to kick off 2026, but all for the wrong reasons. After its maligned reveal at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, despite its <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">launch drawing <strong>97K</strong> concurrent players </a>on Steam alone, those players didn't stick around, and it lost the vast majority of its player base almost immediately. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">review-bombed on Steam</a>, and barely two weeks after it had arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, "<em>most</em>" of the team at developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">had been <strong>laid off</strong>.</a></p>



<p>After one of the laid-off developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">took to X (formerly Twitter) to call out players</a> who wrote the game off after barely giving it a chance and a new report revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-website-remains-down-fans-worry-this-is-it/">details about the game's funding</a>, the latest development is that some of the laid-off staffers have been given permission to start sharing what they worked on at Wildlight as part of their public portfolios. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concept-art-and-videos-of-completed-highguard-characters-and-wip-map-posted-online-by-ex-staffers.1439296/">ResetEra</a>, Wildlight allowing the former artists to share their work is a good-faith move by the studio, and it gives these artists a better chance to find work by being able to show off these videos and images of currently unreleased characters from the game. That said, the fact that these designs are being released at all raises even more questions about the game's longevity.</p>



<p>Of course, it's possible that the characters shared were concepts that made it far into development, but were ultimately not chosen to be part of any future updates. Though with how things have been going for Highguard so far, seeing unreleased characters appear online in this fashion has players wondering if Wildlilght is allowing them to be shared because the game won't be around long enough for them to be released.</p>



<p>It's definitely not common to see unreleased characters from a live service game that is currently still active, so while the speculation surrounding the release of these images could turn out to be just that, it could also be another sign of Highguard's upcoming shuttering. </p>

			<p>Publisher <strong>CI Games</strong> and developer <strong>Hexworks</strong> have released the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the sequel to 2023's Soulslike game. </p>



<p>The specs are listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Epic Games Store page</a> and match the previous game's CPU and RAM requirements. However, <strong>the GPU requirements have increased</strong>: from Lords of the Fallen's GTX 1060/RX 590 and RTX 2080/RX 6700 to Lords of the Fallen 2's RTX 2060/RX 5700 and RTX 3080/RX 6800 XT. As a reminder, the game is powered by <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine 5</strong>, just like the previous installment.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>12 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Login Required</strong></td><td>Epic ID</td><td>Epic ID</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audio Language</strong></td><td>English</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text Languages</strong></td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in June 2024</a> as an <strong>Epic Games Store exclusive</strong> for PC. However, earlier this week, CI Games CEO <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2023059329600119256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to tease that this could change</a>, <strong>suggesting a Steam launch on day one</strong>.</p>



<p>We'll see. On another note, this afternoon, Ryan Hill (Creative Strategist at CI Games) noted that the reception to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bolder-braver-bloodier-ci-games-digs-into-lords-of-the-fallen-2-combat-in-new-developer-deep-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week's gameplay deep dive</a> has been "<strong>incredible</strong>".</p>



<p><em>I'm seeing the age-old 'blame the customer' rhetoric popping up again in the games industry. No gamer wants to waste time, money or effort, just to be disappointed by a gameplay experience. It is nearly always the game at fault.</em></p>



<p><em>It would have been very easy for us to 'blame the customer' in 2023 when Lords of the Fallen launched. Instead, we took it on the chin, rolled our sleeves up, and released 70+ updates. Three years later, and we've just revealed the first alpha footage of Lords of the Fallen 2. And the response has been incredible. We listened, we acted. And guess what? It worked. But we're far from done yet. Gamers want good games. End of.</em></p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 will be released this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/presentation-the-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026"><strong>State of Video Gaming 2026 Report</strong> </a>from <strong>Matthew Ball</strong>, chief executive officer at <strong>Epyllion,</strong> is now available, and as usual, there are more than a few solid insights and takeaways to make note of. Like how software sales for the global video game market in 2025 rose by <strong>5.3%</strong> to a staggering <strong>$195.6 billion</strong>, but at the same time, funding from private investors hit another major dip, dropping by <strong>55%.</strong></p>



<p>Console software sales also hit an all-time high, recovering from the post-COVID slump to hit <strong>$41.6 billion</strong> in spending, a <strong>2.3% increase</strong> compared to the highs of the 2020 pandemic. That said, the majority of that spending has gone to <strong>platform services</strong>, which would include things like <strong>PlayStation Plus,</strong> <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch Online</strong>. </p>



<p>Actual game sales and transactions were down nearly <strong>11%</strong> compared to last year, which is a tangible example of why subscription services have become so important for platform holders. That's why, while the entire industry faces concerns about hardware sales, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-memory-shortages-ps5-ps5-pro/">Sony in particular is less concerned</a> due to its software revenue. It's also why the company plans <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increases-monetizing-install-base/">to lean more on its current install base,</a> and why we could likely see a price increase on PS Plus if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dram-nand-shortages-will-extend-beyond-2030-warns-phison-ceo/">memory crisis continues to worsen</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, when comparing PC gaming to console gaming, PC gaming not only didn't have to endure a post-COVID slump, but PC content sales have grown by <strong>30% since 2020</strong>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that a huge chunk of that spending and growth comes from players in China, who account for <strong>20% of global player spending.</strong> But even without factoring in the spending that comes from China, the PC market still sits above the console market growth by a solid <strong>$6.7 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>The lack of investment coming into the industry, however, continues to have a major impact on the industry. Outside of some of the biggest companies, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon lays off thousands of employees at once</a>, layoffs like what we see from studios like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">Three Fields Entertainment</a></strong> don't just come from disappointing game sales. A lack of private investment means that smaller teams like Three Fields can't survive if their projects aren't huge hits.</p>



<p>Another side-effect of this that's noted in the report is that, where possible, studios will look to outsource more of the development process to try and keep internal costs down. And while PC gaming continues to outpace console gaming, one platform that is growing, which Ball also believes will become one of the industry's biggest factors, is <strong>Roblox</strong>.</p>



<p>The platform was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">top-played games in 2024 and 2025</a>, and reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">a staggering <strong>47.3 million concurrent users</strong></a> in August 2025. That said, as big as Roblox is, it'll be interesting to see how much the platform continues to be impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">by the legal efforts against the company</a>, as it has earned a reputation for a lax approach to child safety on the platform. Now, at least, the company is trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/">improve its ability to protect children on the platform</a>.</p>
