			<p>It's been over half a year since we had any update from developer <strong>inXile</strong> on their next game, the steampunk RPG <strong>Clockwork Revolution</strong>. Following a new trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown at the 2025 <strong>Xbox Game Showcase</strong></a> in June, inXile founder and CEO <strong>Brian Fargo</strong> had claimed the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would feature 'truly evil' options for players and multi-person dialogues</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Fargo has been featured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clockwork-revolution-could-be-the-most-expressive-xbox-rpg-in-years-with-inxile-aiming-to-bring-the-level-of-reactivity-from-our-isometric-titles-into-something-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new interview published by GamesRadar</a> in which he described Clockwork Revolution as <strong>the studio's most ambitious game</strong> 'probably by a factor of 10', on account of them trying to translate the level of interactivity usually seen in isometric games into a first-person action RPG.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Fargo once again stressed the importance of building truly alternative options for players to choose, even if that means creating more content that can be seen in a single playthrough.</p>



<p><em>For me, roleplaying means I can play a role and actually affect the world around me. If all paths lead to the same outcome, the immersion breaks, and you start to feel like you're just playing a game rather than living in one. But when the world is constantly reacting and reflecting your choices, both in big ways and just as importantly in small ways, that's when immersion really sets in.</em></p>



<p><em>We probably build roughly 30% more content than what any player could see in a single playthrough. We want players to be able to approach the game as a different archetype, whether you want to be good, evil, or something in between. Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path. We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made for them. We also have a very dark sense of humor, which makes all of it even more fun.</em></p>



<p>Clockwork Revolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first showcased during the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The game doesn't have a release date, so unless Microsoft and inXile are secretly planning a late 2026 launch, we're probably going to have to wait until 2027 to play it. As a reminder, inXile's previous game, <strong>Wasteland 3</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in August 2020</a>. </p>



<p>The game is currently announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, although given Microsoft's multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually lands on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, too.</p>
