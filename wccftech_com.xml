			<p>Remedy put out a call on its <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1921933626389786975">social media channels</a> asking for players to sign up for a new closed technical test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/">FBC: Firebreak</a> taking place this weekend.</p>
<p>The studio is focusing on testing the crossplay functionality in FBC: Firebreak during this test, so players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S are all <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/waitlist">encouraged to register their interest</a> in joining. The test will begin on May 15 and run until May 19.</p>
<p>Firebreak is due to release in<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-is-out-on-june-17-reveals-remedy/"> a little over a month</a>, and this closed technical test is one of the final steps towards release as Remedy gets set to launch its first multiplayer-focused game. It's a big 'first' for the studio known for crafting exceptional single-player experiences, so it'll be interesting to see if it can land with the players who go to Remedy for those single-player games.</p>
<p>Though perhaps more important than getting Firebreak to land with Remedy's current fans is Firebreak being able to bring in new players to Remedy's titles. Fans of multiplayer games who've yet to try out a Remedy title might find Firebreak to be their avenue into Remedy's other games like Alan Wake and Control, which could be significant in the lead up to Remedy's next major single-player release, Control 2.</p>
<p>However, players who are fans of Control and can't wait for its sequel should note that they don't necessarily need to jump into Firebreak to keep up with the story. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">When we spoke to Remedy</a> earlier this year about Firebreak, the studio confirmed that the core narrative will continue in Control 2, and while there will be some Easter eggs to discover, Firebreak won't include some key narrative details that players should have before jumping into Control 2, whenever it releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-reveals-warframes-isleweaver-update-new-soulframe-trailer-at-pax-east-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-unveils-warframe-1999-update-named-techrot-encore-releasing-in-march/">Digital Extremes</a> took over the PAX East 2025 main stage to discuss a bunch of new information about Warframe and <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/">Soulframe</a>, including the next major update to Warframe, Isleweaver, coming in June, a new Soulframe trailer, and how Digital Extremes is overhauling the experience for brand-new players to make it easier to get into Warframe in the first place.</p>
<p>The Isleweaver update is the next narrative chapter in Warframe's story, continuing the narrative threads that were pulled in Warframe's big 1999 update. Players will return to Duviri and clash with Major Rusalka once again, with new Murmur enemies to fight in the new clan operation, Eight Claw.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Isleweaver Official Teaser - Coming in June!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBsQROfuf0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Soulframe trailer showed off more gameplay from the upcoming co-op RPG, including a new boss that players will fight called the Tired King. The panel also discussed the development journey Soulframe has been on so far, and while there's still no release date in sight, the team did say that those interested in hearing more about Soulframe should tune in to Tennocon 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news of the panel came halfway through, when principal writer Kathryn Kingsley discussed how the new player experience in Warframe has been streamlined to get brand new players to the 1999 content as soon as possible, which will prepare them for everything else beyond that.</p>

<p>"<em>One of the things we did was lay out what ever new player has to do from account creation to 1999, and just tried to streamline that as much as possible to remove as many trip hazards,</em>" Kingsely began saying.</p>
<p>"<em>Making sure that all of the content there sort of made sense and make that as friendly as possible, especially now that we have so much more content at the end of the game. And not removing any content, just making sure that it all just sort of now makes sense now that we have so much cool stuff.</em>"</p>
<p>You can see in the slides below that Vor is getting a rework, Digital Extremes is continuing to work on the Junction, a few enemies are being refreshed and you no longer have to scan a plant before picking it up, you can just pick it up.</p>
<p>Also, Digital Extremes is changing how melee slams work. To prevent players from spamming the melee slam with small hops, you'll soon need to jump much higher to have the same hit radius you can have now with a small hop.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>All of these updates are coming in the Isleweaver update in June.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This dev stream was the last major update for Warframe that players will get until TennoCon, which is taking place <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon">July 18-19</a> this summer, and where we'll find out a lot more about what's to come for Soulframe and Warframe for the rest of the year and beyond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-for-doom-the-dark-ages-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/565124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new GeForce driver (Game Ready version 576.40) for DOOM: The Dark Ages. The game is coming out on Thursday, May 15, but early access begins tomorrow for those who purchased the Premium Edition. This is also the edition that comes with the GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The game supports various NVIDIA GeForce RTX technologies, such as DLSS Super Resolution (on RTX 20 and upward GPUs), DLSS Frame Generation (on RTX 40 and upward GPUs), and DLSS Multi Frame Generation (on RTX 50 GPUs). NVIDIA says that owners of the latest graphics cards can expect up to 4x faster frame rates when enabling all these technologies at once. DOOM: The Dark Ages, powered by id Tech 8, also already supports ray tracing. However, with a post-launch update, its visuals will be further improved with full-fledged path tracing.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages received an 8.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>
