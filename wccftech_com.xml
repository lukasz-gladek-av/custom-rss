			<p>Battlefield 6 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-detailed-pc-specs-from-minimum-to-ultra/">out in just two days from the time of this writing</a>, and when it launches, it'll do so with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen technology, alongside Little Nightmares III, which also launches on October 10, and with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-nvidia-reflex/">NVIDIA in a new blog post about the latest batch of DLSS 4 games</a>, when pushing max settings on Battlefield 6, at 4K, and while using an RTX 50 Series card, you get a "<em>3.8X</em>" boost in frame rates on average. "<em>GeForce RTX 5090 performance rockets to over 470 FPS, the GeForce RTX 5080 exceeds 330 FPS, the GeForce 5070Ti is in touching distance of 300 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 230 FPS.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Little Nightmares III doesn't exactly require the kind of high frame rates you'd want from a shooter like Battlefield 6, it'll still be nice to have a smooth experience while exploring the horrors that Supermassive Games has in store.</p>



<p>Beyond Little Nightmares III and Battlefield 6, NVIDIA also confirmed that when Crimson Desert launches next March, it'll do so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support, with more details to follow as to what that'll look like closer to the game's launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the mountain biking game Mavrix by Matt Jones has also been confirmed to be adding support for DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. </p>



<p>Last month, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Annata <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-ananta-jurassic-world-evolution-3/">were added to the list of games</a> that support DLSS 4.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 update launching on all platforms will introduce new content to the RPG developed by Sandfall Interactive released in April 2025.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/506216119584948426?l=english">a new message shared by the studio on Steam</a>, celebrating the game selling 5 million copies, and the original soundtrack composed by Lorien Testard hitting 333 million track streams since its release. This new update, whose release date has yet to be confirmed, will include new content and features according to the developer. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new playable location environment with new enemy encounters and surprises to find.</li>



<li>New challenging late-game boss battles</li>



<li>New costumes for each party member that will also provide new customization options</li>



<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, which will bring the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
</ul>



<p>New content coming to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is excellent news, as the new challenges will only improve one of the best JRPGs released in the current generation, and, in my opinion, a serious contender for this year's Game of the Year award. You can learn more about why I believe so by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">checking out my</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
