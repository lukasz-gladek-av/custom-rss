			<p>Valve might have <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the new Steam Frame for early 2026, but if you want a new Virtual Reality headset this Holiday season, the PlayStation VR2 is still a great choice. It's already discounted ahead of Black Friday 2025, too: <a href="https://amzn.to/48wab8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon offers it at $299, 25% off the regular price of $399</a>.</p>



<p>This is the bundle that also includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-coming-to-psvr2-with-new-main-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, the flagship launch title developed specifically for PlayStation VR2 by Guerrilla Games and Firesprite. The game is a spin-off of the popular open world action/adventure series Horizon, though it differs from the main installments in that the protagonist is Ryas, a former Shadow Carja rebel, in perspective, which is first-person only to accommodate the needs of a Virtual Reality game, and in being a lot more linear.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the PlayStation VR2 is no longer limited to the PlayStation 5 console and can also be used with a PC, provided you're willing to purchase the PC adapter, <a href="https://fave.co/3KjBPg7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at $59.99 from the official PlayStation Direct store</a>. A DisplayPort 1.4 cable is also required; however, if you are an existing VR user, you likely already have one. You will then download the PlayStation VR2 app <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, unlocking compatibility with thousands of PC games for the headset.</p>



<p>If you instead choose to stick with PS5 VR-compatible games, here's a list of some of the best games:</p>

<p>If you're still on the fence about buying the PlayStation VR2 or not, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the product</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>



<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.</em></p>
