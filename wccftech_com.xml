			<p>After accurately predicting a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumours-were-true-nintendo-confirms-a-parnter-showcase-nintendo-direct-for-tomorrow/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong> for this week, reliable insider NateTheHate has another prediction, this time to do with the arrival of <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, but more importantly, about how <strong>Square Enix</strong> will start its marketing campaign for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>, which, according to NateTheHate, will <strong>not be a PlayStation exclusive title</strong> at launch, and will instead be <strong>multiplatform from day-one.</strong></p>



<p>During the latest episode of the NateTheHate podcast, when discussing predictions for tomorrow's Partner Direct Showcase, on the topic of what Square Enix might bring to the table, NateTheHate predicts that we'll get a release date for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Nintendo Switch 2 during tomorrow's direct.</p>



<p>This follows NateTheHate discussing <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/">Rebirth's Switch 2 release date last week</a>, which he reiterates here will be targeting a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> release window, and more specifically, "<em>sometime in June</em>," as he predicts it will be "<em>in close proximity</em>" to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest</a></strong> event.</p>



<p>Why put out Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Nintendo Switch 2 in the middle of all the SGF craze? According to NateTheHate, it'll be the perfect tie-in for Square Enix to then talk about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 during SGF.</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's going to be in close proximity to Summer Game Fest, and I'll tell you why I have this belief. I think by releasing the game in June around Summer Game Fest, it will allow Square Enix, at Summer Game Fest, to finally announce and give first details surrounding Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3,</em>" says NateTheHate.</p>



<p>"<em>This way, Rebirth is out on all platforms, [and] now we can talk about Part 3, and then at that time, very likely confirm that Part 3 is going to be <strong>day-and-date on all systems. </strong>There's going to be no timed exclusive to PlayStation. It's going to release day-and-date on everything, <strong>even on PC</strong></em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NateTheHate continued, "<em>I think they're going to target everything, because they need all [of] these platforms to get a game to find success at this stage, and there's no reason to stagger the releases anymore</em>."</p>



<p>As for what Square Enix has said about the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 in recent months, we've heard comments that development is<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/"> "<em><strong>coming along really well</strong></em><strong>"</strong></a> and that the company is <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/">"<em><strong>almost at the point when we can share more information about it</strong></em>."</a> </p>



<p>We've also heard comments from the company about how excited they are for players to experience the game when it's ready, like how director <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> was happy to report that Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-nailed-it-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-was-really-looking-forward-to-recreating-this-very-emotional-scene/">"<em><strong>nailed</strong></em>" an emotional and important scene in the third game</a>. Or how Hamaguchi believes the third game will offer "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">a new gameplay experience</a></strong></em>" for players, and that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">will satisfy both veteran fans and newcomers to the series</a>. </p>



<p>If NateTheHate is correct, and we see a trailer and release date for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Nintendo Switch 2 during tomorrow's Partner Direct event, then we can only hope he's right about what's to come for the conclusion to the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. The sales of the first two games in the trilogy were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ff7-rebirth-sales-ffxvi/">unnecessarily handicapped by being PlayStation-exclusive titles</a>, and since both games will be available on all major platforms before the release of Part 3, it makes all the sense in the world to ensure Part 3 is available on all platforms at launch.</p>



<p>We'll see what tomorrow's Partner Showcase brings. </p>
