			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the free-to-play online action game developed by <strong>Digital Extremes</strong>, came up twice as I asked <strong>MMO</strong> industry veterans what the future of Western MMOs looked like. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an interview with <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, who's returning as CEO of <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (he previously held the role from 2011 to 2015, when he left after 15 years at the company). As part of our conversation, I picked up his mind on the difficulties faced by Western developers looking to make a new game in the genre, and Emmert pointed out an example to follow: Warframe.  </p>



<p><em>It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</em></p>



<p><em>I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</em></p>



<p>Anyone familiar with Warframe knows that the game that launched in March 2013 on PC was <strong>quite barebones</strong>. However, over time and with an ear constantly tuned to the community's feedback, Digital Extremes expertly introduced new content and features on a regular basis, <strong>making it one of the best examples of a live service game in the whole industry</strong> and securing an extremely loyal fanbase.</p>



<p>In 2026, Warframe <strong>is a whole different beast</strong>. It has a ton of content and activities to satisfy different playstyles, and it has also successfully expanded across all available platforms (the final one, Android, will get the game on February 18 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a couple of months of Closed Beta testing</a>). Of course, someone could argue that Warframe is not quite an MMO in the traditional sense. Even so, the larger point holds: <strong>start with a solid 'minimum viable product' and build on it over time</strong>. The example is doubly fitting because Digital Extremes did everything on its own, developing and self-publishing the game, which is what a developer would have to do in the current absence of investments for MMO games.</p>



<p>Anyway, Emmert was not the only MMO veteran to point out Warframe to me when I inquired about the state of the genre in Western countries. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview I published last month</a>, <strong>Greg Street</strong> (former World of Warcraft and League of Legends designer) told me:</p>



<p><em>The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</em></p>



<p>Street and Emmert know each other quite well, so it's possible they spoke about this before and found they shared the same viewpoint. Their insight is particularly interesting because they both bashed their heads against the problems faced when making a new MMO game in the West: their companies, <strong>Jackalyptic</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Pixel Castle</strong>, were working on two new MMO games, one based on Warhammer and another on a new fantasy IP. </p>



<p>In both cases, they were funded by NetEase, which, however, changed its mind a couple of years later and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed both studios down</a>. This experience likely contributed to their conviction that <strong>a small game, like Warframe when it launched, can eventually become much larger</strong> and should serve as a model for future titles that do not have the budget to start big.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-release-date-february-2026/">After a second rumour</a> pointed to a current-gen <strong>PS5 version</strong> of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> coming from developer <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> last month, the new version has been all but officially confirmed, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4062-CUSA07180_00-KCDGAME010000000"><strong>UK</strong> <strong>PlayStation Store </strong>listing</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3mdiqkxbtl225">Gematsu</a>) describing the features this unofficially announced PS5 version would include, like the game getting a resolution boost to <strong>4K</strong>, an <strong>improved framerate</strong>, and more.</p>



<p>This new version of the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">first rumoured to be in the works back in October 2025</a>, before the aforementioned December 2025 rumour pointed to its imminent arrival, once again pointing to an early 2026 release, though last time the rumour went a step further to add that it would release sometime in <strong>February 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The updated store page description doesn't include a hint as to when the new version will be available, or if this new version will be made available through a free update or if it'll be a paid upgrade. What it does include is confirmation that Warhorse has given the original release a good once-over, with updates to the graphics, framerate, and textures.</p>



<p>"<em>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful</em>," the updated description reads.</p>







<p>Hopefully, this means we can expect a reveal from Warhorse Studios soon, and while there's no guarantee that this will be a free update, the fact that we're seeing this reveal come in the form of an updated PS Store listing is probably an indication that it's just a major update, and not a full remaster or a separate release. </p>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> has revealed the <strong>four games</strong> that will be offered to <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> and higher-tier subscribers for the month of February 2026. The games will be made available on <strong>February 3, 2026,</strong> with the boxing game <strong>Undisputed</strong> and survival game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> headlining the monthly offerings after PlayStation kicked off the year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/"><strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong></a>. </p>



<p>The official announcement was shared <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, as it usually is, and also, as usual, at least one of the coming games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911">had already leaked on Dealabs</a>, with Undisputed being the game to leak early this time. </p>



<p>Beyond Undisputed and Subnautica: Below Zero, the monthly offerings for February include two other standout titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/"><strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>,</a> which is arriving just in time for anyone who hasn't yet played it to prepare themselves for the arrival of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a></strong>, and <strong>Ultros</strong>, the indie metroidvania from developer <strong>Hadoque</strong>, which sees players explore a twisting Sarcophagus.</p>

<p>With the above four titles set to arrive on February 3, that means you have until <strong>February 2, 2026,</strong> to add January's monthly PS Plus Essential games to your library, if you haven't already. If you're a PS Plus Extra or even Premium tier subscriber, then this is unfortunately another month where you're getting games that were already available to you in the Games Catalog, as Ultros entered the PS Plus Extra catalog when it launched back in February 2024.</p>



<p>At least PlayStation players at every tier of a PS Plus subscription and even those not subscribed to the service can <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reportedly look forward to a new <strong>State of Play</strong> event, currently said to be happening sometime during the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, if it's not on the 12th itself.</p>
