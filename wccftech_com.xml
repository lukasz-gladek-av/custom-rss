			<p>Former Criterion developers who worked on series like Need for Speed and Burnout at Fuse Games have announced a different kind of fast-paced arcade racer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a game that doesn't seem to entirely rely on pod racing with a mix of pods and classic speeders, arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Developed by Fuse Games and published by Secret Mode, Star Wars: Galactic Racer was the second Star Wars game to be revealed at The Game Awards tonight, and is the sixth Star Wars game in development that we know about.</p>



<p>Compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic (the other newly announced Star Wars game)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">the third Star Wars Jedi game</a>, Galactic Racer appears to be bringing a bit more variety to the Star Wars games we have to look forward to.</p>

<p>"<em>For us, </em><em>Star Wars</em> has always represented the power of wonder—and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> is one of its most thrilling expressions," said Matt Webster, chief executive officer at Fuse Games, in a press release. "<em>With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, we wanted to reinvent what a racing game can be: adventurous, spectacular and exhilarating. We want every race to feel alive with dynamic risk-reward choices, and every victory to feel incredible</em>."</p>



<p>Vice president and general manager at Lucasfilm, Douglas Reilly, added, "<em>From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy. With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll be able to build and customize your ride as you join the Galactic League to rise from your state as a lone racer in the Outer Rim to a household name among racing fans across the galaxy. It's a runs-based racing game "<em>where no two runs are the same</em>." </p>

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tga-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> always has plenty of its trademark “World Premieres,” usually only a few of them are legitimate surprises. Leaks, or just common sense, often spill the beans ahead of time. Well, this year the big show ended with a completely under-the-radar announcement – Highguard. This new PvP raid shooter is coming our way from a number of the original creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/titanfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> who broke away from Respawn Entertainment to form the new studio Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Highguard looks like it’s going to be pushing a lot of different ideas at once, with tons of different powers in the mix, although the thing people are probably most likely to pick up on is that you can shoot people while riding a dang horse. A horseback shooter – it’s one of those things you never knew you needed until you see it with your own eyes. Check out the debut trailer for Highguard for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Is Highguard primed to be the next breakout indie-developed shooter ala something like Arc Raiders? That's a tough call to make, but it certainly has the pedigree behind it and looks to be throwing a lot at the wall. You can't say this one is playing it safe, that's for sure. T<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he game’s Steam page is up</a>, with this rather basic description of the game attached…</p>



<p><em>“From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</em></p>



<p>Highguard is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. We won’t have to wait too long to find out exactly what kind of game it is and what level of potential it has, as it will be launching on January 26, 2026. The game will be free to play.</p>
