			<p>In August, inZOI released a demo of the game's Character Studio so that those who were interested to see how The Sims competitor played out could have a chance. The game was originally meant to be released before 2024 was finished, but it looks like that dream has been dashed, and it's now set to enter Early Access on March 28, 2025. Today, inZOI Director and Producer Kjun made an announcement<a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1854509177508593738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854509177508593738%7Ctwgr%5E7b573ef972c48b9dd35f814b1f86691118ccede4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fthe-sims-competitor-inzoi-will-now-enter-early-access-on-march-28-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Discord</a>, giving the statement that the Early Access period of the upcoming competitor has been delayed to March 28. inZOI was also a game that was showcased at Gamescom and received a lot of positive chatter and feedback about their title.</p>
<p>"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start."</p>
<p>Of course, to those who enjoy life simulators, this does come as a pretty disappointing announcement, especially as the Character Studio seemed to be well received, with many people posting pictures of their creations online. Compared to The Sims, the game is shaping up to be hyper-realistic, with a ton of built-in customization, something that is often seen to be a little bit lacking in The Sims without the use of mods or custom content.</p>
<p>Continuing his statement, Kjun provided a peculiar analogy: "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's uncertain whether the Character Studio demo will remain available for people to keep playing on, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/"> KRAFTON</a> and inZOI's development team haven't made an announcement about this as of yet. However, it's possible that they will mention this in their Discord server, which is a hub of activity and conversation between fans and developers alike.</p>

			<p>Although the Xbox Series X machine learning hardware is not on the same level as the PlayStation 5 Pro's, it has some use cases, but Microsoft never showed any interest in using it.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> addressed a point of discussion that's been circulating on social media in the past few days, suggesting that Sony, with the PlayStation 5 Pro, has finally caught up with Microsoft regarding machine learning, saying that having machine learning hardware in the console, and not doing anything with it doesn't exactly mean catching up. The around 100 TOPS of the Xbox Series X are in reference to INT4, which is usually not used for machine learning upscaling. Still, there's nothing preventing Microsoft from developing a machine learning model that could run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but the company just doesn't seem interested in doing so. The Series consoles' machine learning hardware could have been used, for example, to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-showcases-auto-sr-automatic-super-resolution-the-first-os-integrated-ai-upscaling-technology-powered-by-npus/">Auto SR</a> for Xbox 360 backward-compatible games, as the company developed a model that can operate on 40 INT8 TOPS MPUs, something that would have been easily manageable by the current generation consoles' machine learning hardware.</p>

<p>Given that the Xbox Series X|S architecture was developed back in 2016 when machine learning was on the horizon, it's not surprising that it wasn't used for anything. Things, however, are definitely set to change in the future console generation, especially after seeing the excellent results the first iteration of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</a> is capable of achieving.</p>

			<p>If you're trying to decide whether you should be playing Baldur's Gate 3 on PlayStation 5 or PC and are feeling a little bit daunted by the specification requirements on PC, don't panic. It's been tested and confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-on-ps5-is-effectively-the-pc-version-at-ultra-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those over at Eurogamer</a> that the settings on PlayStation 5 are essentially the same as the settings on PC if you were to play it on Ultra. Of course, many people are unable to do so, as the game is very graphically intensive, the world is expansive, and there are lots of visual effects that you need to contend with. Baldur's Gate 3 has been out on PC for quite a while, and since the start of its release, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">a number of fixes</a> to work on making the performance of the game better for rigs of all capabilities. While there was some concern about how Baldur's Gate 3 would run on PC, it's been confirmed that it runs fine in Act Three, but it suffers some of the same issues that the PC version does.</p>
<p>While the game is very obviously tailored with a Keyboard and Mouse in mind, the game works just fine with a controller on both PS5 and PC. At the start of the game, it's quite tolerable, and although it looks a little bit odd, it works. However, the more abilities and items you unlock and use, the more complicated your radial menus will get, which can make the interface incredibly overwhelming.</p>
<p>Although this doesn't really affect the performance of the game on PS5 in any way, it does make it a little bit more finicky to work with. Visually, the PS5 version is very similar to that on PC, and it looks almost the same as how it would if the game was being played on PC in ultra settings. Compared to other games on the console, this comes as quite a surprise. As explained in the article by Eurogamer, there are only two options available for image quality on the PS5, with the game being native to 1440p, with no signs of reconstruction or dynamic resolution. If you're unsure whether you should be playing the game in Quality or Performance mode, it doesn't really make much difference.</p>
<p>The Performance mode on PS5 looks very similar to the Quality Mode, but there is a little bit of artifacting and fizzing artifacts in areas that feature a lot of fine detail. This is to be expected, especially considering how they've tried to keep the game running at the highest quality.</p>
<p>When it comes to the performance of the game, the Performance mode of Baldur's Gate 3 on PS5 targets 60fps. For the vast majority, it does do just that, especially if you're inside or in enclosed spaces, even during combat. However, there are some areas that will start to struggle. Even on PC, the city in Act 3 struggles massively, so it's not a surprise that it struggles on the PS5, too. From the tests that Eurogamer ran, it seems that the performance drops to the low twenties when it's at its worst. They've also mentioned that there is a fair amount of screen tearing when the frame rate starts to dip from 60. There is, of course, the option to play the game using the Quality Mode, which easily sees Baldur's Gate 3 run at a target of 30fps. Regardless of being in Quality Mode, you will still see some issues in Act 3, with how densely populated the city is.</p>
<p>Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 has been confirmed by many to run fine on PS5, as long as you can get over the radial menus and get used to how janky they become later on down the line.</p>
