			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would help boost sales, as it's one of the most popular and best-selling game franchises out there. As a result, US games consumer spending is rising once more in the month of October, with the sales being boosted nicely by the launch of Call of Duty. This information comes from<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sales-up-10-following-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-us-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Circana's monthly report</a>, which says that hardware, software, and accessories sales combined have gone up by 10% year-on-year for a sum of $4.7 billion. Activision confirmed with The Washington Post that with the inclusion of Black Ops 6, the franchise as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole surpassed 500 million units</a> sold. This statistic makes it one of the best-selling game franchises of all time.</p>
<p>Content represented $4.23 billion of that sum, which is a 12% rise compared to October 2023. Hardware sales were down by 23%, making it a sum of $249 million.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched and immediately hit number one in the October charts, becoming the third best-selling game of 2024 to date. Subscription spending also increased, which can also be attributed to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as this was the first game in the franchise to be a day-one release on Game Pass. In the report, Circana stated that non-mobile subscriptions grew by 16% compared to last year, making it evident that Black Ops 6 played a massive part in this. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">Xbox further verified this information</a>, as they announced that the title was breaking records for Game Pass subscriptions at the end of October.</p>
<p>The report also goes on to mention that console content was the biggest contributor to the rise in content spending, providing a 27% increase compared to the same period last year, with the rise being driven by digital full-game sales. Again, Black Ops 6 is to thank for this. Confirmed by Circana's Mat Piscatella, it's been confirmed that PlayStation platforms accounted for 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 total console full game dollar sales during October.</p>
<p>"Over its first two weeks in market, full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 were 23% higher than the full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 over its first two weeks in a market a year ago," says Piscatella. Overall, this information isn't too much of a surprise, as Modern Warfare 3 wasn't as well received as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been.</p>
<p>Along with the new Call of Duty, games like Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Silent Hill 2, and Metaphor: ReFantazio were amongst the top-selling games from October 6 to November 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-pushes-ryzen-7-9800-x3d-limits/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 is an extremely demanding game from both a CPU and GPU standpoint, pushing a powerful CPU like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-positions-ryzen-7-9800x3d-competition-against-intel-top-core-i9-14900ks-gaming-cpu/">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> to its limits so much that it struggles to hit very high framerates at low resolutions.</p>
<p>A new benchmark shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compusemble</a> highlights how demanding the second entry in the series by GSC Game World is, especially on the CPU. In the two scenarios the benchmark is set, both of them extremely CPU intensive, a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU struggles to hit a 100 FPS average even at 1080p resolution. At a higher resolution, such as 4K, the AMD CPU also struggles to keep a steady 60 FPS in both benchmarking scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2 Benchmark From 4K to 720p - How Does It Scale With Resolution? RTX 4090 &amp; Ryzen 7 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmRMU9Y9PFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Performance concerns on both PC and consoles haven't stopped fans from purchasing the game, as STALKER 2 managed to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/">1 million units</a> in just a few days of availability. While the game stays true to its predecessor and its premise, the game by GSC Game World isn't exactly a game for every sort of player, as Alessio highlighted in his review-in-progress.</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since its release in 2023, Baldur's Gate 3 has taken the world by storm. It isn't much of a surprise, really, considering how much content and customization there is, as well as some truly lovable (and hateable) characters that you can romance or kill. The main thing is that most things in the game are completely up to you, and you can choose to play the game in a myriad of ways, with each playthrough having the potential to be different from the previous one. When it comes to single-player RPGs, they tend to die off relatively quickly, as people will have completed the story shortly after it comes out. However, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to remain healthy, with a strong and consistent player base. According to Larian's Director of Publishing, Michael Douse, Baldur's Gate 3 performed better this year than it did in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1859244899847069827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Douse revealed</a> that the daily peak player counts were up by 3% compared to last year, with average daily users up by 20% and average daily Steam Deck users up by 60%. There are many factors that could be contributing to the fact that Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be popular. A lot of it likely revolves around the fact that Larian Studios has had great community support, and has patched the game where it needs, as well as adding new content. Since it was released, the game has received multiple new endings for the main companions, as well as official mod support.</p>
<p>Even Douse has said that mods are a huge reason as to why more people are playing Baldur's Gate 3. While mods were available on PC previously, they didn't have official support from the developers and required a fair few steps to install, which could lead to your game bricking. However, the developers have now added an official mod manager, which allows people to mod their game with ease and makes the removal of them significantly more accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most monumental moves made by Larian was allowing those on console access to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">the mod manager</a>. It's a huge rarity that games on console can get any sort of modding. For example, games like The Sims 4 are notorious for being modded on PC, but that just isn't an option for console players. This was a huge move by Larian and has definitely helped keep the game relevant, as well as their consistent updates to the game.</p>

The video is just over two and a half minutes long and showcases some of the iconic fighters that will be making an appearance in the game.</p>
