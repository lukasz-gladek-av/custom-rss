			<p>According to two prominent insiders, Fortnite Season OG will return permanently in December. The news was reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1853920988594930095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1853920981682704412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who received the information from an anonymous source and were able to confirm its veracity. They also said all Fortnite Chapter 1 seasons would return monthly with an OG item pool. Moreover, both Build and Zero Build modes will be available. The announcement is expected at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 12, starting at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Fortnite Season OG <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> for the first time last November, marking record player numbers for Epic. The first day after the relaunch, the Battle Royale game registered the biggest day in its history with more than 44.7 million players. It came at the right time, too: just a few months before, Epic had been forced to lay off sixteen percent of its workforce. Fortnite's comeback, which started with Season OG, was largely responsible for a much healthier state of the company's finances.</p>
<p>Epic seems to have figured out Fortnite users are really into nostalgia. Right now, there's the Chapter 2 Remix season <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-is-live-now-brand-new-kicks-cosmetics-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on live servers. Are you enjoying it? What do you think about these returning seasons? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>An Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video was shared online today, highlighting the improvements made possible by the soon-to-be-released mid-generation console by Sony.</p>
<p>The comparison, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, provides a new look at the game's ray-traced reflections on opaque and transparent surfaces exclusive to PS5 Pro between consoles, better shadows, volumetric lighting, and fog compared to quality mode on the base model and Xbox Series X, and performance mode settings comparable to quality mode on base console and Microsoft's most powerful current generation system. The video also highlights how PSSR delivers a much better image quality than AMD FSR 2 but also causes artifacts in some areas. Still, these are very impressive results for the first iteration of the upscaler.</p>

<p>Alan Wake 2 launched last year on PC and consoles and continues to be one of the most stunning survival horror games released in recent years. Last month, the game was expanded with The Lake House expansion, which serves as a clear introduction for the next story in the Remedy Connected Universe, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</em></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>An early Elden Ring PlayStation 5 Pro test was shared online, showing how the console can brute force improvements in games even without a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>The test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> reveals how the action role-playing game by FromSoftware often runs at native 4K resolution in Performance Mode while keeping close to 60 frames per second framerate most of the time. In Quality mode, on the other hand, performance is shakier but still manages to be close to 60 frames per second while constantly running at native 4K resolution. The biggest performance improvements, however, are seen with ray tracing, which is not surprising considering the console's GPU improvements over the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring - PS5 PRO - Resolution and Performance - Patch 1.17" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFbBlagU1VE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how Elden Ring's performance on the base PlayStation 5 isn't as solid as it should have been, this is definitely good news, as a dedicated PS5 Pro patch would definitely make 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay possible. Even with its technical hiccups, however, the game is worth experiencing for fans of the Souls series, as it is the natural evolution of the successful formula created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>
