			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been out and in players' hands for a full two weeks at the time of this writing, EA and Battlefield Studios have begun updating, tweaking, and refining the experience to squash bugs and address player feedback. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-latest-changes-and-preparing-for-season-1">The latest update, which went live today in preparation for Season 1,</a> includes tweaks to the Custom Search queue option and a fix for a vehicle spawn bug.</p>



<p>What's more intriguing about the update is what's still to come, as Battlefield Studios lists changes and refinements to player movement and continued changes to player progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">that Battlefield Studios began implementing last week</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</em>"</p>



<p>Beyond player movement, the player progression changes and tweaks continue to be a point of issue for players, since a large chunk of the community was looking to custom servers in Portal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">to farm XP in bot-filled PvE matches</a>. </p>



<p>Battlefield Studios is "<em>continuing to monitor</em>" the changes it made and the conversations around player progression within the community, with a specific focus on XP received in Escalation and King of the Hill matches not properly registering for players, and how players feel about the challenges offered in daily and weekly challenges, and the challenges for classes and weapon unlocks. </p>



<p>"<em>We've seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team's working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of these challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully EA and Battlefield Studios can find a better balance for player progression compared to the current state of it, specifically around how challenges work for unlocking weapons and attachments. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">an aspect I commented on in my Battlefield 6 review</a>, and would like to see improved sooner than later.</p>



<p>More updates to come include changes to weapon dispersion, which will arrive with Season 1 on October 28, and changes to visibility when it comes to exposure and brightness in matches.</p>



<p>Lastly, it's worth noting that Battlefield Studios comments on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">battle royale mode that it has been testing in Battlefield Labs</a>, with changes made to close-range time-to-kill, armor changes, world improvements and vehicle balances. Even if you're not a part of the Battlefield Labs playtesting, it's worth going over these changes since it seems extremely likely that the battle royale mode will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">shadow-dropped into the game next week on October 28.</a></p>
