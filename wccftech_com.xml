			<p>Today, the developer behind Corepunk, Artificial Core, <a href="https://wccftech.com/corepunk-is-an-upcoming-top-down-mmorpg-featuring-pve-pvp-and-fog-of-war/">has announced that Corepunk</a> will be going into Early Access on November 26. This game is shaping up to be an open-world MMORPG crossed over with a MOBA, with a top-down isometric viewpoint to the game. If you think this is something that will interest you, there is a trailer on YouTube that is just under two minutes long to showcase what you can expect from Corepunk. You can watch this video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corepunk: Official Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0L8Aj0u9CM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Corepunk comes with a lot of unique features, including expansive character customization, fog-of-war mechanics, and the ability to experience both PvE and PvP in a player-driven world. There are a variety of class options with in-depth skill trees that allow you to stand out from the crowd while you explore the cyber-fantasy world and engage with the storylines set out in front of you.</p>
<p>For those who are curious about the Early Access period of Corepunk, it will feature three full-voiced story episodes, which include a crafting and gathering system. You'll have six character classes to choose from and 15 world bosses to go up against. Of course, this is just the start of the game, and there will be plenty more added in the future. For those who pre-order the game, it will give access <a href="https://corepunk.com/en-us?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=b8576b44ac-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_11_18_06_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-b8576b44ac-256552253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game launcher</a> and Early Access build.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Corepunk is in active development, with the Early Access period symbolizing the final stage of alpha testing, which is where the developers will be focused on making sure the game is optimized with bug fixing and polishes while also continuing to build on the content that is already released. Corepunk is set for a full launch by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>During the Early Access period of Corepunk, you'll get to explore three biomes, which will take you through the forest, swamps, and steppes, which all have their own unique challenges to face. In total, there are 350 quests that you can participate in during the Early Access period. A lot of these are side quests and are totally optional, allowing you to tweak the playstyle to your liking. As the Early Access period progresses, the developers plan on adding the Extraction Prison Island, PvE instances, and more heroes for players to choose from, allowing for a further unique experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Capital Markets Day dedicated to investors, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment has revealed new information on Control 2 and Alan Wake 2. As for the latter, we learned that it has sold 1.8 million units to date, which, however, isn't enough to fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoup</a> all the development and marketing costs yet.</p>
<p>Control 2 is aiming far higher, with Remedy telling investors that sales of 3-4 million units would be required to fully recuperate a budget of €50 million (up from the €30 million spent on the first one) and go into profits. Part of the reason is that the sequel is being turned into an action RPG, whereas the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> an action adventure. Action RPG is a more marketable genre with a bigger audience. The first Control has sold 4.5 million units to date, while 19 million players have accessed the game in total (including, for example, Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscriptions).</p>
<p>Control 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Back then, it looked like Remedy would repeat the successful partnership with 505 Games that gave birth to the previous installment. However, they completely <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> the plan earlier this year by acquiring the IP from 505 Games for €17 million. Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Remedy had chosen a new partner, Annapurna Interactive; they would co-finance the game's development while leaving the IP in the hands of the Finnish studio and also work on live action adaptations for both Control and Alan Wake.</p>
<p>Before Control 2, Remedy will launch its cooperative multiplayer spin-off FBC <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, which is being made on a €30 million budget, won't cost full price, and will require three million units sold to be successful.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in addition to the multiple projects related to the so-called Remedy Connected Universe, the studio is also remaking its first two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, for Rockstar Games. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, the remake project entered full production three months ago.</p>
