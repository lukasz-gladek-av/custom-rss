			<p>More than 100 notes to collect and read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> are scattered throughout its 14 chapters. That might seem like a lot, but if you follow this and every other chapter guide I've posted so far, you'll see how it's straightforward to pick each one up along the way as you play through the game.</p>
<p>And you'll want to grab them all because South of Midnight's storytelling, including these written notes, is by far the strongest part of the game.</p>
<p>There are another 10 notes to collect in Chapter 6. Here's where to find them all.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 doesn't give you much of a break compared to Chapter 5, as this chapter has 10, instead of 11, notes to pick up. As you'll see below, at least a few of them are clumped together.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Keep Out Sign Materials</strong> - A little ways into the chapter, after using an echo of a crashed boat to jump across a river; you'll find the first note of the chapter on a box to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Abernathy's Lament</strong> - You'll find this note on the second level of the barn you go through to find the hole for Crouton to enter and get rid of the Stigma Knot blocking your path. To get there, you'll need to enter through the roof, which you can do by heading back the way you came through the barn, where an echo of a wagon is sitting and waiting to your left, behind a couple of trees trapped together with vines. Use the wagon to jump onto the roof of the barn, and through a hole in the roof you'll reach the second level which contains a health filament and the note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burn After Reading</strong> - Once you see Bunny's cottage, before you walk through the gates you'll see a path to your left that leads to a combat encounter. Once you've cleared it, as you head back to Bunny's cottage you'll find this note resting on a box between two rocks to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Correction Requested</strong> - After walking through the gates to Bunny's cottage, walk around to the back of the cottage to find a large tree in her backyard and a small cabin to the right of the tree. Walk past the cabin and you'll see some sunflowers next to crates of honey, with the note resting on a honey crate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on the Rogarou</strong> - You won't find this note, or the next three, until after completing the three combat encounters to get into Bunny's cottage. Thankfully, this note and the next three are all inside the cottage, so you're clearing through a bunch quickly. This first one is on a table in the room to your right once you walk in the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's Journal - On Weavers</strong> - This note is in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's left bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on Dreams and Fog</strong> - This note is also in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's right bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Missing Children List</strong> - You'll find this note in the secret room behind the bookshelf in Bunny's bedroom, on a desk towards the back of the secret room, to the left of where you'll see Huggin' Molly's red yarn.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrowers Hate a Liar</strong> - After the cutscene with Bunny, and once you're in your new duds, follow the path away from the cottage and beyond a few exploding mushrooms. You'll find this note in a dead tree on the right side of the path.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Huggin' Molly Sightings</strong> - After speaking to Catfish, follow the path beyond some more exploding mushrooms to the point where you'll see two paths. One that leads you to the tree Catfish was talking about by using your grapple, and the other to your left with the echo of a bridge. Take the left path to find another combat encounter, and once you've cleared it, you'll find this note on a box to your right as you exit the combat arena.</p>
<p>And that's all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 6. You should have 38 out of 103 by now. Only 65 more to go.</p>

			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Self—</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>
