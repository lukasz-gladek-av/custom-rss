			<p>In August, inZOI released a demo of the game's Character Studio so that those who were interested to see how The Sims competitor played out could have a chance. The game was originally meant to be released before 2024 was finished, but it looks like that dream has been dashed, and it's now set to enter Early Access on March 28, 2025. Today, inZOI Director and Producer Kjun made an announcement<a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1854509177508593738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854509177508593738%7Ctwgr%5E7b573ef972c48b9dd35f814b1f86691118ccede4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fthe-sims-competitor-inzoi-will-now-enter-early-access-on-march-28-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Discord</a>, giving the statement that the Early Access period of the upcoming competitor has been delayed to March 28. inZOI was also a game that was showcased at Gamescom and received a lot of positive chatter and feedback about their title.</p>
<p>"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start."</p>
<p>Of course, to those who enjoy life simulators, this does come as a pretty disappointing announcement, especially as the Character Studio seemed to be well received, with many people posting pictures of their creations online. Compared to The Sims, the game is shaping up to be hyper-realistic, with a ton of built-in customization, something that is often seen to be a little bit lacking in The Sims without the use of mods or custom content.</p>
<p>Continuing his statement, Kjun provided a peculiar analogy: "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOIâ€”a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's uncertain whether the Character Studio demo will remain available for people to keep playing on, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/"> KRAFTON</a> and inZOI's development team haven't made an announcement about this as of yet. However, it's possible that they will mention this in their Discord server, which is a hub of activity and conversation between fans and developers alike.</p>

			<p>Although the Xbox Series X machine learning hardware is not on the same level as the PlayStation 5 Pro's, it has some use cases, but Microsoft never showed any interest in using it.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> addressed a point of discussion that's been circulating on social media in the past few days, suggesting that Sony, with the PlayStation 5 Pro, has finally caught up with Microsoft regarding machine learning, saying that having machine learning hardware in the console, and not doing anything with it doesn't exactly mean catching up. The around 100 TOPS of the Xbox Series X are in reference to INT4, which is usually not used for machine learning upscaling. Still, there's nothing preventing Microsoft from developing a machine learning model that could run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but the company just doesn't seem interested in doing so. The Series consoles' machine learning hardware could have been used, for example, to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-showcases-auto-sr-automatic-super-resolution-the-first-os-integrated-ai-upscaling-technology-powered-by-npus/">Auto SR</a> for Xbox 360 backward-compatible games, as the company developed a model that can operate on 40 INT8 TOPS MPUs, something that would have been easily manageable by the current generation consoles' machine learning hardware.</p>

<p>Given that the Xbox Series X|S architecture was developed back in 2016 when machine learning was on the horizon, it's not surprising that it wasn't used for anything. Things, however, are definitely set to change in the future console generation, especially after seeing the excellent results the first iteration of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</a> is capable of achieving.</p>
