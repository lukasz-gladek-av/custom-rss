			<p>Amidst controversies <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">surrounding its use of Generative AI tech for NPC voices</a>, Embark Studios' latest release, the third-person extraction shooter ARC Raiders, continues its sales streak, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-dominated-steam-again">Alinea Analytics</a>, it has almost reached 7 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p>After selling close to 750K copies on Steam last week, Alinea Analytics reports that ARC Raiders is at 4 million copies sold on Steam alone, and is due to reach the 7 million mark soon. Last week, the game's publisher, Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">reported that it had officially sold over 4 million copies.</a> </p>



<p>It's further proof that ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the video game industry's biggest hits in 2025. It was even one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shooters-dominated-october-2025-revenue-mau-charts-battlefield-6/">top 20 games for MAU and revenue in Newzoo's October 2025 report</a>. Though, as is the case with all multiplayer games, a strong launch is only the beginning. Now, it's about consistency in the long run. It'll be interesting to see where the game stands a year from now.</p>



<p>Other notable titles in Alinea Analytics' latest report include PEAK closing in on 15 million copies sold, making it one of the biggest indie titles of the year. RV There Yet? and AdHoc Studio's Dispatch were also two of the top-selling games on Steam last week, as indie games continue to have a strong showing this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto reviewed ARC Raiders</a>, giving the game a 9/10 and praising its sound design, gameplay loop, map design, and more. "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

			<p>Nioh 3 will be the first game in Team NINJA's fantasy action RPG series to be published by the studio's own parent company, Koei Tecmo. The first two games were published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, which meant they launched first on PlayStation consoles and only later on PC, whereas the new one will be available on PS5 and PC at the same time.</p>



<p>That's far from the only change in this third entry. Another big one is that it will offer an 'open field' environment instead of the relatively linear maps seen in the previous two installments. This, as explained by producer Fumihiko Yasuda <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/nioh-3-i-producer-del-team-ninja-ci-hanno-svelato-tutti-i-retroscena-del-progetto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Multiplayer.it</a>, will make the game more accessible than the first two Nioh games, and the team also avoided sudden difficulty spikes that could make the game unpalatable to newcomers. However, the overall level of challenge remains as high as customary for an action game created by Team NINJA, a studio known mainly for the Ninja Gaiden series (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just received an excellent new release</a>).</p>



<p><em>There are players out there who probably invested thousands of hours in the Nioh series, but there are many more who may be interested in Nioh 3 as newcomers, and I'd like everyone to be able to enjoy the game. For newcomers, we have added a very thorough, albeit not excessive, tutorial. But the most important thing was to ensure that the game wouldn't have sudden difficulty spikes. Everything must happen gradually. The exploration has much more freedom, but there are also very tough foes to defeat on the open field. What we focused on was offering players many more ways to defeat the bosses, be it equipment or the exploration itself. But the challenge level typical of our games was not reduced.</em></p>



<p><em>I always thought that the focal point, which is really important for this game, is how you face defeat. Perhaps in a demo like the one we showed at Tokyo Game Show, you are defeated, and that can be frustrating. But what really matters is what the player thinks after being defeated. What do I have to get? How do I have to prepare to win? We chose to offer many options so that players could find their own way to victory, to defeat those powerful bosses. Ultimately, being able to succeed, the exhilarating sensation that comes with that, discovering that you could indeed beat that boss, is very important, and it was essential that we maintained that in Nioh 3, too.</em></p>



<p>Nioh 3 will be released on February 6, 2026 for PC and PlayStation 5. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent hands-on preview here</a>.</p>
