			<p>Earlier this year, when Turn 10 Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost over 70 members of its development team</a> as part of the latest round of layoffs mandated by Microsoft, a former employee <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Turn 10 had effectively been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio. This chain of events had fans fearful about the future of the racing simulation franchise.</p>



<p>Now, at last, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on this as part of a Tokyo Game Show 2025 interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Famitsu</a>. The Japanese magazine asked him whether the Halo and Forza Motorsport franchises were done for. Spencer vehemently denied that for Halo (which was quickly confirmed when the long-rumored Halo: CE remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced this weekend</a>), but had a more elaborate response with regards to the racing IP, hinting that it is currently 'resting' - albeit still not over.</p>



<p><em>No! Halo Studios is planning for the future and taking on new challenges. We're committed to Unreal Engine 5 and new technologies. We're committed to giving them the time they need to invest in the Halo franchise and create the next great game in the Halo series. </em></p>



<p><em>Regarding Forza Motorsport, we sometimes need to shift our focus to games that are released sooner. We understand the reaction many people had when we scaled back Turn10 Studios. We have a large number of games we want to support carefully, and sometimes we give development teams a little more time to avoid putting them under strain. Our current structure allows us this flexibility.</em></p>



<p><em>Xbox Game Studios has over 20 studios, and we have many games in development, each with different support needs. We have both short-term and mid- to long-term perspectives. We want our games to be successful. Xbox Game Studios is currently developing many titles, so please look forward to them in the future.</em></p>



<p>The thing is, Microsoft already tried giving Turn 10 Studios a lot more time with the next chapter in the racing series. Whereas the first seven Forza Motorsport games were released every two years without fail between 2005 and 2017, the last one, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reboot launched in 2023</a>, took six years to make and was still ultimately underwhelming according to most long-time fans. It also doesn't help that its sister franchise, the open world arcade racing game Forza Horizon, is massively more popular and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will return next year with the long-awaited Japan setting</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Comments on Gaming Copilot AI Controversy]]></title>

			<p>Last week, a ResetEra user <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that the new Gaming Copilot AI installed by Microsoft on all Windows 11 PCs (integrated directly into the Game Bar) was training itself by screenshotting every game played by the user and then sending everything back to Microsoft. Gaming Copilot is also enabled by default, so if you want to turn it off, you need to go to the Game Bar, and then to Settings and Privacy Settings, where you will find the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "Model training on text" or not.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this discovery sparked a big controversy on what several users felt was a highly intrusive feature sneakily introduced by Microsoft. Following the news, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/microsoft-says-gaming-copilot-uses-screenshots-to-understand-in-game-events-not-for-training-ai-models-optional-feature-can-be-turned-off-but-not-easily-uninstalled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom's Hardware</a> was able to get a statement from the company about what the AI actually does:</p>



<p><em>When you're actively using Gaming Copilot in Game Bar, it can use screenshots of your gameplay to get a better understanding of what's happening in your game and provide you with more helpful responses. These screenshots are not used to train AI models, and Gaming Copilot is an optional feature that only has access to gameplay when you're playing a game and actively using it. Separately, Gaming Copilot may use its text or voice conversations with players to help train and improve AI. Players can adjust Gaming Copilot's privacy settings by visiting 'Settings' in the Game Bar, followed by 'Privacy Settings.</em></p>



<p>The AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first tested earlier this year on mobile devices</a>, though the global rollout only started last month on both PCs and the Xbox mobile app. Microsoft introduced Gaming Copilot as a sidekick specifically designed for gamers. Using AI, it recognizes which game is being played and understands the user's Xbox activity, allowing it to answer questions about games the user is interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the user's account, play history, and achievements. Essentially, it is a guide to the game, should the player need it. Of course, it should be entirely optional, and its training feature should be disabled by default to comply with privacy laws.</p>
