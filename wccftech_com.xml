			<p>Yesterday, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-out-now-with-game-ready-driver-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tomorrow-in-delta-force-black-hawk-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> integrated support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation as part of the game's third update. The game was also updated to support the latest DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution transformer-based AI models, which offer improved quality, as well as Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray tracing. Ray traced shadows also now optionally include all light sources, significantly increasing the quality of shadows in interior locations. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> also reveal good news for AMD and Intel owners, too:</p>
<p><em>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, the third Indiana Jones and the Great Circle adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology, allowing players without GeForce RTX 40 or 50 graphics cards to take advantage of frame generation in the game. Lastly, the patch&nbsp;also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<p>There are also a few technical fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements have been made to environment lights to present a more natural appearance when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency mode would cause inconsistent frame rates</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Nvidia Frame Generation became disabled when HDR was toggled on</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Indy’s hair was missing in reflections when using Path Tracing</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with light leaks in underground locations in Gizeh when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As we had assumed, the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair feature</a> is not available in this update. Indeed, the patch notes mention it as a possible addition for future Indiana Jones and the Great Circle updates alongside HUD modification, which the community has requested.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive is officially making a new game based on one of Hasbro's big franchises. The news comes directly from Chris Cocks, formerly president of Wizards of the Coast and now CEO of parent company Hasbro (quote <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/20/hasbro-has-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Motley Fool</a>):</p>
<p><em>We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant about what it could be. Hasbro has several big franchises that could be adapted into a videogame: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, to name the most important ones. However, Transformers seems to be the most fitting for the developer behind the highly successful Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. There's already a G.I. Joe game starring Snake Eyes in development at Wizards of the Coast-owned developer Atomic Arcade, after all, and Dungeons and Dragons already has its own lineup: a co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Starbreeze</a> targeting a 2026 launch; a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Invoke</a>, formerly Tuque, developer of Dark Alliance; another game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Demeo developer Resolution Games</a>, now announced as <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/battlemarked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dungeons: Battlemarked</a>; and another game that Chris Cocks had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>Transformers fans, on the other hand, had to deal with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate at Splash Damage</a>. Plus, there's the fact that the studio's expertise seems much more suited to a shooter game rather than, say, a Magic: The Gathering game. Still, we'll have to wait and see. It might be a while before we learn more about this project.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Saber is also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok: Origins</a>, a triple-A RPG based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Jurassic Park Survival, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a> that was once in the hands of Aspyr. If that sounds like too much work, it's worth reminding that Saber is a massive company with many offices across the globe and nearly 2,700 employees.</p>
