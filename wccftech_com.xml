			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive has unveiled a lot more details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a>: Battle for Brooklyn DLC, starting with its release date. The expansion will be released on May 27 on PC and consoles and will be priced at $14.99. It also comes with purchases of The Division 2 Gold Edition or The Division 2 Ultimate Edition. Both editions include the standard game, the Warlords of New York expansion, 50 stash slots, and a level 40 boost, allowing players to jump into the Battle for Brooklyn campaign right from the start. The Ultimate Edition also includes 1000 bonus Premium Credits and the Year 1 Pass, unlocking endgame specializations, exclusive missions, and more.</p>

<p>The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn brings players back to the location of the first game. According to the developers, though, this version of Brooklyn offers new opportunities for exploration and interaction. The DLC's main missions have been crafted to provide a bespoke narrative experience, allowing players to immerse themselves deeper in the story rather than feel overwhelmed by side missions. Ubisoft Massive estimates that the first playthrough could take anywhere between six and ten hours to complete. The Cleaners now wield a new “Purple Flame” weapon. Players will have to beware, as it inflicts a corrosive effect that reduces the player character's max armor.</p>
<p>Smart Cover returns in Battle for Brooklyn as a redesigned skill for PvE and PvP. The use of Smart Cover will increase the offensive and defensive cover buffs and increase boss resistance for all allies. Players can choose between two variants, the Precision Smart Cover and the Fortified Smart Cover. Both variants have some stats that are tuned differently for PvP.</p>
<p>The developers also looked beyond The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn, specifically to what players can expect in Year 7. For the next year of live support, Ubisoft Massive will focus on three aspects: improving the onboarding process, adding more depth to the endgame, and making sure the seasons are a 'cornerstone' of the game's experience with more regular updates. Interestingly, they also said that the open world will be more dynamic thanks to a new wrapper that reacts to the player's actions while unlocking exotic blueprints.</p>

			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>
