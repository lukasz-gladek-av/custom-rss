			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">Saber Interactive</a> and NBC Universal have finally shown a little bit more about the first-person horror game that takes players back 65 million years, Jurassic Park: Survival. In a behind-the-scenes feature that includes commentary from both Saber and Universal's teams on how the studios worked to recreate the park from the original film into a game.</p>



<p>The feature provides details on the game's protagonist, Dr. Maya Joshi, the work that went into ensuring animations for the dinosaurs were as accurate as possible, and how Saber has been leaning on its collaboration with Universal to be as detailed as it can when it comes to recreating every element from the first film that fans of the series would recognize.</p>



<p>In between all that, there are a few very short looks at the first-person gameplay, though the feature doesn't dig any deeper into the different gameplay elements we see, like a handheld map and compass Dr. Joshi is using to try and get around the island, and what appears to be a noise meter, helping her to know how loud she's being in any given situation.</p>

<p>All the footage shown is marked as 'pre-alpha,' though even in this unfinished state, it is already beginning to look impressive. That said, it's likely a disappointing sign for anyone who is anxious to get their hands on Jurassic Park: Survival, since this is the first look at the game we've had since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJ9gf-TbWc">December 2023 announcement trailer,</a> and this kind of a feature makes it feel like the game's development is progressing slowly.</p>



<p>But that's just worried speculation as someone who is very much looking forward to the final product. Jurassic Park is a series that videogame horror fans have long recognized as a good foundation for a horror game. Hopefully, whenever the game does come out (cause there's still no confirmed release window, let alone release date), it's able to deliver on the experience of just how harrowing it would be to be trapped on Isla Nublar.</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Tekken 8 is not off the table, but it is also far from certain at this point. The news comes directly from Game Director Katsuhiro Harada, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to Eurogamer</a> during the recent Evo event:</p>



<p><em>It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware. From a business standpoint, the Switch 2 is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are noâ€¦ (laughs) There is nothing to announce.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly a surprising statement from Harada. After all, this is not a complex open world, but a fighting game powered by Unreal Engine 5, which fully supports the latest Nintendo console. Far more taxing titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 for example, have been successfully ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. Perhaps the real reason is that Bandai Namco does not see enough of an audience on the console to justify the port expenses, although fellow Japanese CAPCOM begs to differ, having released Street Fighter 6 on the Switch 2 when it launched on June 5. The port has been well received so far, too.</p>



<p>Anyway, Tekken 8 continues to be supported. At Evo 2025, Bandai Namco announced that a new DLC character, Armor King, will be released on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>
