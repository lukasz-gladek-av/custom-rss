			<p>A box art for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> a few hours ago via the ResetEra board. The leak also includes some information suggesting that it will be a remake of the first installment in the series, originally developed by Core Design and released in 1996. The box art matches Lara Croft's pose in the teaser image <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-tomb-raider-game-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared ahead of the planned announcement</a> that will go live during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a> later today.</p>



<p>As officially confirmed by Crystal Dynamics, this game is intended to somehow unify the various Tomb Raider series and the protagonist, Lara Croft, who will be more mature and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident</a> than in the recent reboot trilogy. It is, however, unclear whether this remake is in addition a brand new title or if it's the main project Crystal Dynamics has been working on.</p>



<p>There are also a few screenshots circulating, but their resolution is so low that even the best upscaling tools cannot make them decent enough to share. Best to wait for the official ones, which will no doubt be available after the TGA announcement.</p>



<p>The new Tomb Raider game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being developed using Epic's Unreal Engine 5</a>, marking a departure from the proprietary Foundation engine used in previous titles. Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will publish it</a>, and there are rumors that it will <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share the same universe</a> as the upcoming TV series, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a> (and, according to a new rumor, Sigourney Weaver is also in the main cast). </p>



<p>When it comes to game details, we only have <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/">an old rumor</a> that it may be an open world game set in India where Lara Croft can explore the environments with a handy motorcycle. Again, though, we'll have to wait and see if those details were referring to Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis or something else instead.</p>

			<p>Although many of its mechanics mark a set step forward for the franchise, Monster Hunter Wilds hasn't been as well-received as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>, mostly due to its low challenge level at launch and significant performance issues on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>While the development team addressed the low challenge issue in the past few months, introducing more powerful monsters and Arch-tempered variants with free title updates, performance issues still prevented many from enjoying the game. However, it seems like the time has come for CAPCOM to address the matter finally.</p>



<p>The Ver. 1.0.4.00 update launching on December 16 will implement CPU and GPU optimization across all hardware, applying a variety of improvements such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Applying frame distribution, reviewing collision detection, and reducing the number of simultaneous effects to optimize processing time.</li>



<li>Reducing the overall load by eliminating unnecessary processing.</li>



<li>Implementing over 100 performance improvements for players, monsters, Seikret, Palicoes, NPCs, GUI, effects, gimmicks, and more.</li>
</ul>



<p>The elimination of unnecessary processing, in particular, promises to address the issue that most suspect was behind the most significant performance issues. Shortly after release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an in-depth analysis suggested that performance hiccups were related to data streaming to the GPU</strong></a>, as the game likely streamed elements in and decompressed textures aggressively when the camera was in motion, among other factors.</p>



<p>Besides introducing over 100 performance improvements, the next Monster Hunter Wilds title update will also introduce new monster Gogmazios, additional 9★ tempered monsters, a tempered 9★ Rathalos roaming the Scarlet Forest and Oilwell Basin at Hunter Rank 100, balance changes for all weapons, support for new paid cosmetics, and more. All the details on the update can be found on the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.040.00.00.html">official website</a></strong>.</p>



<p>If the game's performance issues are finally fixed across all formats, Monster Hunter Wilds will be in a much better state than at launch later this month. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>more players will consider returning to the game, as producer Yuya Tokuda hopes.</strong></a></p>
