			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is getting a new DLC expansion in just two days from the time of this writing, with the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/"> The Forsaken Hollows DLC</a> arriving on December 4, 2025. The DLC was announced last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">just as players were complaining about a lack of content</a> in Nightreign.</p>



<p>The Undertaker is one of two new characters added in the DLC, with today's trailer showcasing an impressive flying move where the Undertaker charges into enemies through the air, with a direct hit stunning even the more terrifying bosses.</p>



<p>When the DLC was announced last month, the Undertaker was described as a character featuring "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>," which this trailer definitely leans into with her swinging a heavy weapon around. In a press release, FromSoftware adds that she "<em>lets her faith be the hammer that purges the darkness festering in Limveld</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds a second new playable character, the Scholar, and two new bosses for players to fight with these new characters. It also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that opened in Limveld and isn't exactly a whole new map, but it seems to at least be a new area of Limveld for players to explore.</p>



<p>Overall, it'll be interesting to see how players respond to the Forsaken Hollows. If you didn't purchase the deluxe edition of Elden Ring Nightreign, then you'll have to pick up this DLC separately as a paid expansion for $15 USD. It's not the biggest ask, but after months of players complaining that Nightreign lacked post-launch support, arriving late to the party with two new characters, two new bosses, and a new sub-area might not be what players had in mind when thinking about what they would expect from paid DLC.</p>



<p>Of course, those who absolutely devour new content within the first few days of its release aren't the example to use for how the community feels about the new DLC overall; you can practically write the Steam reviews now for the players that have tens of hours in Nightreign already, who will complete all the new content within two days of its launch, complaining that there wasn't more to do.</p>



<p>That said, it's not unfair to say that if Nightreign wants to maintain the commercial success it achieved in 2025, FromSoftware will likely need to do more for it than it currently is.</p>

			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake continues to be among the most requested remakes of classic JRPGs released in the 90s. Although it is not officially on the horizon, something could be brewing, judging from Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii's reaction to a question related to the highly requested remake.</p>



<p>Speaking during a discussion program shared on YouTube on November 30, the legendary game creator was asked if the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th Anniversary projects</a> are suggesting that the game is being remade. Interestingly, Horii-san did not deny the existence of the remake, replying instead that he cannot say anything about the matter and that he shouldn't be asked about it.</p>



<p>Although Yuji Horii's reaction is most definitely not a confirmation that a Chrono Trigger remake is in the works, the fact that he did not deny its existence could be telling.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the creator of the Dragon Quest series, who also worked on the SNES game as one of its writers, has discussed this highly requested remake in recent months. Back in May, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">a translation error made during Horii-san's appearance at the Napoli Comicon </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank">sparked hopes of a remake</a>, which is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/">only being considered for a possible HD-2D overhaul</a>, rather than</span> a full-blown remake.</p>



<p>Chrono Trigger was originally released for the SNES in 1995 and later ported to the Nintendo DS, PC, and mobile platforms. These enhanced ports include additional content not found in the original release, such as new dungeons, a new final boss, and a new ending which connects the game better with its sequel, Chrono Cross, which was <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition-iconic-yet-underserved/">remastered as The Radical Dreamers Edition in 2022. </a></p>



<p>Hopefully, these enhanced ports won't be the last we hear of what is widely considered one of the finest JRPGs ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Halts Tencent From Promoting Light of Motiram During Horizon Lawsuit, Court Dates Set for January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1370551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first showcased Light of Motiram, practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">everyone online looked at it and pegged it as a clone/rip-off of Sony's Horizon series</a>. So it wasn't that much of a surprise to onlookers when Sony issued a lawsuit against Tencent, calling it a "<em>slavish clone</em>." Now, a new report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">The Game Post</a> reveals that the suit has moved into its next phase, during which Tencent has agreed not to promote Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>This new phase is also a slowing of the proceedings between Sony and Tencent, with both sides asking the court to extend the current briefing period and to schedule the court hearings on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">Tencent's motion to dismiss the case</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">Sony's recent injunction</a> to the same date in January 2026. </p>



<p>In the meantime, according to the latest filing, which was submitted to the Northern District of California on December 1, both sides have, according to the report, "<em>engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agree, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction, (b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the</em> <em>Light of Moitram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction</em>."</p>



<p>The hearings for the motion to dismiss and the injunction will both take place on January 29, 2026, and ahead of that, Tencent will file its reply to Sony's injunction on December 17, 2025, with Sony's reply to that reply set for January 2, 2026. Basically, everyone is taking a big breath, and in the meantime, they'll prepare for what could be the conclusion of this suit by January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Especially if the current discussions both sides have engaged in prove fruitful, and an agreement is able to be reached even before we get to the hearings in January.</p>
