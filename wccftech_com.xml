			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software aims to improve upon the series' predecessors in all regards, including the endgame portion. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/07/creative-director-discusses-designing-the-very-ambitious-endgame-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Game Informer</a>, Creative Director Graeme Timmins explained:</p>



<p><em>I care about it a lot personally, as my role on Borderlands 3 was curating what became the endgame for that. I know what's important to our community, and that's built already into the game. Like, we made purposeful decisions with our Action Skill tree, assuming what will come in the future with our endgame. It's not a secret that we always eventually do level-cap increases, right? That's built into the high-level design of saying, 'Okay, if that's going to still be in our future, how can we make our Action Skill tree this time anticipate that and be balanced from the jump.</em></p>



<p><em>In Borderlands 3, we ended at 72 skill points. It's a really high number, right? And so, for the game designer in me, that can create a lot of chaos with how those Action Skills were designed. You lose build diversity as you add more skill points because everyone's homogeneous, because they all have the same skills ultimately unlocked. We've thought about Borderlands 4's endgame from the jump, and we have some great plans for it that we're going to share, but I think we're taking a lot of the lessons from both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and Borderlands to make sure that we execute the best version of the endgame yet for Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>If it succeeds, Borderlands 4 could be a very long lived game, as the endgame is what can really keep players coming to it. We'll see after launch, which isn't far at all, especially after Gearbox brought the launch date forward <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from September 23 to September 12</a>, much to the excitement of fans.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-july-cyberpunk-2077-abiotic-factor-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-and-more/">announced</a> the games added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for July 2025, with Cyberpunk 2077 being the big title for the month, alongside Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Risk of Rain 2, New World: Aeternum and more. </p>



<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, then you'll have nine new games to dive into beginning July 15, which is when all of this month's games, save for one, will be available. Abiotic Factor is the one title you'll have to wait for, since it is launching into the service on July 22, 2025. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers will only be missing out on the two Classic Catalog games, which are Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4, just in time for the new season of the Twisted Metal TV show, which premieres on July 31, 2025.</p>

<div><p>Cyberpunk 2077, however, is available right now for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, though it's just the standard version of the game and does not include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. That you'll still have to purchase separately, but at least it's available at a 30% discount for PlayStation Plus subscribers until July 23. </p><p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for July 2025:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden (PS5)</li>



<li>Planet Zoo (PS5)</li>



<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>



<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>



<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PlayStation Plus is celebrating its 15-year anniversary this month, which partly explains why bigger titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are part of the catalog additions for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, and why all PS Plus subscribers got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">Diablo IV earlier this month</a> as part of the three free games for Essential-tier subscribers.</p>



<p>According to PlayStation, there's still more to come as part of the anniversary celebrations. Hopefully we'll get to see what else there is soon. Perhaps a few more games for subscribers, as a cherry on top for the occasion? We'll see.</p>
