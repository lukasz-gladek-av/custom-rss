			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, the long-anticipated action game developed by Ultizero Games (and initially made by a single man, Yang Bing), is finally out now on PC and PlayStation 5. The developer has released a free demo on both platforms to give users a taste of the game before committing to the full expense of $59.99 (for the base edition; the deluxe one is $10 more expensive). According to the studio, the demo allows players to experience selected combat encounters from the full game, try out different abilities and weapons, and face challenging boss fights.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch event, there's also a launch trailer, which we've embedded below. However, earlier user reviews on the Steam platform are not promising. Only 54% of 247 reviews submitted up to this point are positive. In most cases, users report their first impressions of a game that is still rough, unpolished, and with performance issues. That perhaps explains why publisher Sony did not send out review codes in advance to the press, as they practically always do.</p>

<p>The official X account of Lost Soul Aside has already <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside/status/1961327660228821305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed</a> a specific bit of feedback regarding cutscene issues that will be fixed with an upcoming patch:</p>



<p><em>We have received your feedback regarding the performance of certain cutscenes in the prologue of Lost Soul Aside. Currently, some of these cutscenes are pre-rendered 4K/30fps videos, which may cause occasional stuttering during playback. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding. The Lost Soul Aside team is actively working on optimizations, and future updates will address this to deliver a smoother gameplay experience.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it may be best to wait a while longer before jumping into the game and trying to rescue Kaser's sister, Louisa, and save humanity in the process.</p>

			<p>Today, HoYoVerse (previously known as miHoYo) has announced a new creature collector strategy game titled Honkai: Nexus Anima. As you can guess from its title, it is set in the same universe as <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-version-2-6-update-launches-october-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, the free-to-play gacha RPG launched in 2023.</p>



<p>This game will play very differently, though, as you can see in the footage embedded below. Here's the official description provided by the development team: </p>



<p><em>In the game, players take on the role of a plane-hopping traveler who has escaped captivity, embarking on an all-new adventure. The journey begins in a tranquil town that opens into uncharted realms. As players advance, they encounter Anima companions with distinct personalities and forge bonds that carry through both exploration and combat. In Nexus Battles, these companions stand beside players as the story uncovers the mysteries of the protagonist’s past. As the latest major entry in the Honkai series, Honkai: Nexus Anima continues to deliver the franchise’s signature high-quality storytelling and artistic style, and it also marks a bold new chapter in both gameplay and worldbuilding.</em></p>

<p>HoYoVerse is currently recruiting for a 'Nexus Bond' test that will be available via PC and iOS devices, with the studio sharing these recommended PC specs: Intel i5 (11th Gen)/AMD Ryzen 5 5000 series or higher CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060/AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT or higher graphics card, and 16GB RAM. Windows 10 64-bit or higher and 15GB of space are also required. For iOS, you will need an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or any later model (excluding iPhone 13 and 13 mini). The app requires iOS 14.0 or above, 6GB of device RAM, and 10GB of space.</p>



<p>Signups are open <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> through Friday, September 12. Honkai: Nexus Anima is definitely one game to watch, especially after the enormous success of Genshin Impact and, to a lesser extent, Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
