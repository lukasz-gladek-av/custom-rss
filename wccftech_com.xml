			<p>One of next year's most anticipated games is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>. The fantasy RPG franchise originally created by Lionhead is returning fifteen years after its previous mainline installment, and fans are understandably excited.</p>
<p>Since IP owner Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-legends-officially-cancelled-lionhead-studios-closing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Fable Legends and subsequently shut down Lionhead in 2016, they had to pick a new studio to reboot the series from the ground up. As we've known for a few years, that studio is Playground Games. The British team has crafted some stellar games in the Forza Horizon IP, but that's a racing game; could they deliver the same level of quality with an RPG?</p>
<p>That's certainly the biggest question mark at this point. According to Windows Central's Jez Corden, though, there's not much to fear. Speaking in the latest episode of the Xbox Two <a href="https://youtu.be/VmNZUoJnqdg?t=5844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, he claimed to have seen some footage of Fable that looked fantastic, featuring combat modeled after The Witcher series, probably due to Playground having hired some former CDPR employees.</p>
<p><em>I very recently saw some Alpha gameplay footage from Fable. I have no idea when it was from, I don't know if it was earlier in development or if it was recent, but it looked fantastic. You can tell that this game has CD Project Red DNA. Playground Games picked up a bunch of developers, I believe they picked up the combat designer and you can kind of tell. I'm not saying it's 100% one-to-one with The Witcher because it's not, but you can kind of tell with that melee combat, the pirouettes, the dodging, the seamless hack and slash into an execution, which looks really cool. All that stuff is there; it looks super polished, super good. If this was early gameplay, then it probably looks even better now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that,&nbsp;there was a lot of mixing in of different weapon types. There was pulling out a bow and arrow and also dropping spells I saw a spell that lifted a group of dudes off the ground and slammed them down. I also saw some enemies, like a giant chicken, for example. It actually just looked like a chicken with that sort of comedic angle but also not. Like, it looked like a dangerous scary chicken. Also, I saw werewolves. There was a scene where they lured a werewolf out of its lair with bacon and eggs and sausages.</em></p>
<p><em>It looked really great. The combat looked really tight. I saw a variety of weapons. I saw a big mallet thing which was being used to swing around and hit multiple enemies at once. My hype level went up a lot from seeing that stuff, so that's why I'm so bullish on Fable now.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, The Witcher 3's combat was one of its few criticized gameplay elements. Then again, the developers of this new Fable might have simply been inspired by the foundation while polishing it even further. We'll have to wait until we see proper gameplay to tell. With The Game Awards coming up, maybe Microsoft will show a new trailer.</p>
<p>Corden also reported to have heard back at Summer Game Fest that Fable would allow character selection, probably between a male and a female option, which will be good news for those who didn't fancy the character seen in the trailers so far.</p>
<p>Fable is currently slated to launch next year, probably toward the end of 2025, for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, some earth-shattering rumors are coming from the Land of the Rising Sun. Reuters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports&nbsp;</a>that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware owner Kadokawa Corporation. Two sources said a deal could be closed in the coming weeks. The mere rumor was enough to send Kadokawa's stock up nearly 23% today.</p>
<p>Like most big Japanese corporations, Kadokawa is really old. It was actually founded only a few months after the end of the Second World War. Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. The most recent version of the corporation was borne out of the October 2014 merger with Dwango.</p>
<p>The group as a whole has several branches for publishing books, manga, films, anime, and much more. Of course, for Sony's PlayStation, the fact that Kadokawa owns nearly 70% of FromSoftware, the studio behind Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring, is clearly a big deal. Moreover, if you've been reading Wccftech, this might not surprise you that much.</p>
<p>Sony already <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> a capital alliance with Kadokawa in February 2021. In August 2022, they even <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> directly in FromSoftware, acquiring around 14% of the shares (Tencent also purchased 16% of the shares at the same time). Shortly following the latter announcement, Hermen Hulst (then head of PlayStation Studios, now CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group) <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-head-teases-new-pc-gaas-investments-possible-transmedia-collaboration-with-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at possible collaborations with FromSoftware not only on games but also on adaptations through the PlayStation Productions division.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this July, and renowned author G.R.R. Martin, who famously contributed to the worldbuilding and lore behind Elden Ring, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> in a not-so-subtle fashion that a feature film or a TV series adaptation might be on the way. Again, it wouldn't be out of character for Sony, which is pushing a lot of its big franchises (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, while the Horizon Netflix TV series was halted due to the showrunner's issues) to be adapted for cinema or television.</p>
<p>Fans of FromSoftware's games are really only interested in knowing how this potential acquisition might affect them, though. Would Sony remove the studio's upcoming games from Xbox and possibly stagger their PC releases? It seems unlikely. Much of the studio's success was built on the multiplatform availability of most of its games, and besides, Sony has already shown with Bungie that they're willing to let a newly purchased studio keep making games for other platforms, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for the GOTY category at The Game Awards 2024 and has a solid chance of winning again.</p>

			<p>Video game publisher tinyBuild has teamed up with indie developer Fire &amp; Frost Studios to reveal their upcoming title Of Ash and Steel, an immersive third-person RPG which is inspired by old-school exploration and storytelling. This title is set to release in 2025 on PC via Steam. Of Ash and Steel draws inspiration from classic fantasy RPGs, offering a nostalgic experience that captures the old-school spirit of adventure, combining it with modern graphics and designs with expansive character progression and dynamic combat.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel takes you to the Kingdom of the Seven, where you work on honing your combat skills and creating alliances with those you find on your journey to survive in a harsh land. You start off as a lowly adventurer, but have a lot of potential to become a great hero that people won't be forgetting any time soon. Compared to a lot of RPGs, Of Ash and Steel doesn't plan to hold your hand, as there are no quest markers that tell you where to go. Instead, the exploration is entirely up to you, and you have to rely on your instincts and curiosity to take you to where you need to go. Of course, along the way, you will find plenty of secrets, treasures, and side quests, which will provide you with a lot of content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYB0piWxULE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the announcement of the upcoming RPG, a five-minute trailer has been released on the tinyBuild YouTube channel, which showcases the graphics, some of the characters you'll meet along the way, and most importantly, the world in which you'll be thrown.</p>
<p>As you explore the Kingdom of the Seven, you'll get to experience an immersive atmosphere with a dynamic weather system, a suited soundtrack, and lots of rewards for those who choose to explore the vast wilderness ahead of them. If you're looking for the medieval RPG experience, the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with when the game is set to release in 2025.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is the first game to be released by Fire &amp; Frost Studios, an indie studio that describes itself as "a small studio by choice... of enthusiasts with burning hearts and cool heads."</p>
<p>When it comes to teaming up with publishers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-acquires-banner-saga-versus-evil-and-qa-testing-firm-red-cerberus/">tinyBuild is one of the most well-known publishers</a> in the indie world, as they are responsible for releasing games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and SpeedRunners, with some of their most recent games being Kingmakers and SAND.</p>
