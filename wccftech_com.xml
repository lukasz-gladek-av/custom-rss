			<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> released on the official Ubisoft website, those interested in Assassin's Creed Shadows would be able to read about what is coming in the game. This post specifically focuses on the progression loop of the game, as well as the mastery trees and abilities that are available for players to use. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on March 20, with pre-orders currently being available, which includes free access to the upcoming expansion called <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">Claws of Awaji</a>.</p>
<p>"Having two separate characters with unique archetypes in our feudal Japan world pushed us to rethink how we wanted to approach player progression," says Julien, Associate Game Director. "Our goal was to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of mastery and martial art."</p>
<p>Both Naoe and Yaskue will have multiple Mastery trees that they can invest in, with the trees being unique to both characters. The Mastery trees featured in the game are tied to the unique weapons that they can utilize, as well as the archetypes set for each character.</p>
<p>The weapon trees will allow you to improve your pre-existing skills, as well as learn new combos and increase weapon efficacy, which can help you progress through the game as combat gets harder. When it comes to the archetype trees in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are multiple abilities you can unlock that will be beneficial for Naoe or Yasuke. For example, Yasuke can put points into samurai training, where he can then learn how to switch weapons mid-combo.</p>
<p>To be able to earn Mastery points to utilize the Mastery trees, you will need to level up your character, which can be done by undertaking quests and activities throughout feudal Japan. There will also be unique enemies that you can take down throughout the world, which will also provide you with Mastery points.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes on to explain Knowledge utility, as well as the equipment and stats that you will be dealing with in the game. There will also be a multitude of gear sets that you can collect in Assassin's Creed Shadows for both Naoe and Yasuke. The gear and weapons can be looted from chests or can be found on defeated enemies. It's also stated that the loot is largely randomized to provide players with a sense of unique discovery throughout the game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has released multiple of these blog posts now to provide information for those who may be on the fence about Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as those who are eagerly awaiting the game. Thus far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">controversial games</a> in the franchise, with a lot of uproar across the community.</p>
