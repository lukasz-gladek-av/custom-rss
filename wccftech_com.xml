			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's modest CPU upgrade, only 10% better than the CPU powering the base model, is the system's primary limitation that continues to impact CPU-bound games such as Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>In their in-depth analysis of the mid-generation refresh system released a few days back, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> went over the console's CPU and how it impacts the performance of both unpatched and PS5 Pro Enhanced games. Unpatched games such as Cyberpunk 2077 do see a small performance improvement in line with the 10% CPU improvement over the base model, but still cannot keep a steady 60 FPS framerate. The situation is not much different in patched games like Baldur's Gate 3, which still struggles to run smoothly in the city of Baldur's Gate, one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, even on the PlayStation 5 Pro, although it does run slightly better than on the base model. At the end of the day, the console still delivers as a mid-generation refresh, but its dated Zen2 CPU falls behind today's mainstream CPUs in the gaming space, which deliver way better performance.</p>

<p>Another limitation that the PlayStation 5 Pro shared with the base model is 4K, 120Hz output, which is still limited by the HDMI controller. In turn, this also somewhat compromises 8K output, although the limited adoption of 8K display and games supporting the resolution makes it less of an issue.</p>

<p>Digital Foundry also took a good look at the PlayStation 5 Pro's PS4 Image Enhancement feature, which brings a variety of improvements to PlayStation 4 games. This feature is a post-processing upscaling filter likely using machine learning, which reportedly only applies to games that render to up to 1080p resolution, improving details. Unfortunately, this feature doesn't improve antialiasing in any way, so games with AA issues continue to have them. In addition, it does seem to impact performance in some titles and causes visual glitches in others. Overall, this feature seems to be a preview of future backward compatibility that will bring some visual improvements with upscaling and very little additional work.</p>

			<p>There's rather "interesting" news around Nintendo this weekend, as the firm is said to have sued a streamer who allegedly showed "unreleased and pirated" Nintendo Switch titles on public forums. In another development, Palword's developer Pocketpair has given insight into the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, disclosing the amount they have been sued for.</p>
<p>Nintendo's track record of suing individuals and organizations and bringing them to court is pretty lengthy, and the firm has now decided to add another entry. In a new report by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-emulator-gamer-who-streamed-pirated-games-before-release-241108/">TorrentFreak</a>, Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against Jesse Keighin, or EveryGameGuru, saying that the individual is involved in leaking Nintendo's unreleased titles on multiple occasions. Keighin is accused of streaming on platforms such as YouTube, Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Trovo, Kick, Vaughn, Dlive, Picarto, Nimo, Facebook, and Loco. Here's what the lawsuit says:</p>
<p><em>Defendant is a recidivist pirate who has obtained and streamed Nintendo’s leaked games on multiple occasions. Leaked games (sometimes referred to as ‘prerelease games’) are copyrighted video games which Nintendo has not yet publicly released.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo says that they have rolled out multiple DMCA notices at Keighin's streams, but the streamer continued to show unauthorized gameplay, which ultimately forced Nintendo to adopt the legal approach. Interestingly, the pre-released in-game content shown wasn't simply of the title itself; rather, Keighin had access to pirated copies, which were played on an illegal emulator.</p>
<p><em>The use of emulators, which circumvent these technological measures, allow people such as Defendant to play pirated Nintendo Switch games — including leaked games — on PCs, Macs, and Android devices.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo claims that Keighin&nbsp;is responsible for pre-release streaming of titles such as Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and Super Mario RPG. Apart from this, Keighin is alleged to have encouraged infringement to its viewers as well, saying that he supplied "links" to pirated titles, ultimately being involved in extensive violation of Nintendo's copyright laws. Nintendo is seeking maximum statutory damages of $150,000 for the infringement by EveryGameGuru, which is indeed a hefty amount for an individual.</p>
<p>Nintendo isn't just after individuals like Keighin. Since the company is pretty committed to its copyright laws, we recently reported on how Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, the creators of Palworld, claiming that the developers allegedly infringed multiple patents on the title. Now, in a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">follow-up post</a>, Pocketpair has revealed that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are now seeking compensation for damages incurred in the filing process, equaling five million yen ($32,846), to both parties.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes at a pretty questionable time, especially since Palword has been out there for quite some time now, yet Nintendo has been quiet after the actual launch. It is uncertain how the lawsuit will turn out for the parties involved, but it is clear that Nintendo was surely influenced by the massive success of Palword.</p>
