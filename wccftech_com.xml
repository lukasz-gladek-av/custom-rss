			<p><strong>Remedy's Alan Wake 2</strong> had a great reception when it launched in late October 2023. It received excellent review scores (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a 9 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), many awards (three at TGA 2023: Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction), and even became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-is-remedys-fastest-selling-title-at-1-3-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>fastest-selling game released by the Finnish studio to date</strong></a>, with <strong>over 1.3 million units</strong> sold as of February 2024. However, sales slowed down quickly afterward. As of late November 2024, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to admit to its investors</a> that the development and marketing costs hadn't yet been fully recovered. That only changed in February 2025, when the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally broke the 2 </a></strong><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank"><strong>million-unit mark</strong></a>&nbsp;and began</span> generating royalties for the studio.</p>



<p>Obviously, this relative underperformance for a title that most genre fans agree is very well-made was discussed thoroughly by fans and industry professionals alike. Two of the main factors identified were <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/">th</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/"> lack of a physical release at launch</a> (which only changed a year later) and, most importantly, the fact that the PC version was and is still only available on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> rather than <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, by far the largest game distribution store on the platform. The permanent exclusivity of Alan Wake 2 didn't sit well with some gamers, who to this day refuse to install the Epic Games Launcher to buy and play the game. </p>



<p>The discussion on the subject was suddenly reignited this week by <strong>Larian's</strong> outspoken <strong>Director of Publishing</strong>, <strong>Michael Douse</strong>. It all started <span>with the comments of&nbsp;<strong>New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry</strong>, who noted on social media that </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>giving away a game for free on the Epic Games Store also boosted sales of the same game</span> on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Addressing that claim, Epic Games founder and CEO <strong>Tim Sweeney</strong> <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717884711633121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> that 'gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals', adding with a jab to Gabe Newell and his famous acquisition of a massive yacht that <strong>the Epic Games Store is now '55-60%' of Steam's userbase</strong> and that, unlike Valve, the company is reinvesting some of its revenue into the Free Program to the benefit of both developers and users.</p>



<p>That's when Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went ahead to say</a> that Remedy '<strong>seemingly went into financial crisis</strong>' because of the game's Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, losing '<strong>potentially hundreds of millions</strong>' by not launching on Steam.</p>



<p><em>I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue.</em></p>



<p><em>Not that they need the money, but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that. The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences.</em></p>



<p>In a surprising twist, Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually chose to answer Douse directly</a>, outlining that <strong>there would be no game at all without Epic's help</strong> and stressing that <strong>they received a 'very fair' publishing deal</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, while Alan Wake 2 would have sold more if it had launched on Steam, it is unlikely that it would have really garnered a large amount of extra sales. The first installment sold a similar amount, after all, and it didn't have that issue. Moreover, it isn't like it's the only Remedy game to suffer this fate. <strong>The studio is known for its portfolio of great games that never quite sold as well as they should have</strong>, with the exception of <strong>Control</strong>, which is, however, in a much more popular genre. If there's anything the studio regrets right now, it is more likely to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the disastrous</strong> <strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It was already excellent news for gamers (and for Epic itself) that <strong>a sequel was made at all, which was far from guaranteed</strong>, and even more so that it turned out to be <strong>a fantastic survival horror game</strong>, thus keeping the Remedy Connected Universe going. On that note, a new entry will be released this year: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, a full-fledged action RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a></strong>, making it more likely to turn profitable in a short time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> announced that it planned to become a privately owned company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">with the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong> leading a '<strong>Consortium</strong>' of investors in a massive <strong>$55 billion</strong> buyout</a>. The buyout has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">passed the approval of the company's shareholders</a>, with the next and final step being getting the approval of global regulators, including the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As that process is ongoing, we don't know yet whether the FTC will choose to fight the acquisition or let it pass, but as many as <strong>46 members of the US Congress</strong> don't want the deal to go through without the FTC "<em>thoroughly</em>" looking it over.</p>



<p><a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf">In an open letter</a> to the FTC chair, <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong>, signed by 46 House Democrats led by the Labor Caucus co-chairs, <strong>Steven Horsford</strong>, <strong>Debbie Dingell</strong>, <strong>Mark Pocan</strong>, and <strong>Donald Norcross</strong>, the representatives express their "<em>serious concerns</em>" with the deal, and want it to be "<em>thoroughly reviewed</em>" as it comes under the FTC's purview. </p>



<p>"<em>We are writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed acquisition of Electronic Arts (EA) by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, and private equity firms<br>Silver Lake and Affinity Partners,</em>" the letter begins. "<em>We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction</em>."</p>



<p>The letter goes on to cite the recent instability of the video game industry, which has suffered tens of thousands of job losses in recent years, EA's contributions to those layoffs, and the massive disconnect between EA's executive leadership and its median worker, highlighted by EA's chief executive officer, <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong>, taking home<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year"> <strong>260 times more</strong> compared to the median EA worker.</a></p>



<p>It noted concerns over the fact that the buyout comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">EA taking on <strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which it says "<em>creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including <strong>layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures</strong></em>." The letter also expresses competition-based concerns, saying that the scale of the "<em>cross-ownership</em>" involved, were the deal to go through, "<em>presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>The last major point the letter makes is one indicating that this merger, should it be approved, could violate some of the FTC's own antitrust laws regarding mergers that harm workers, suppress wages, and enable dominant firms to reduce labor demands. It then closes by saying, </p>



<p>"<em>We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes. Workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued</em>."</p>



<p>These 46 House Democrats are not the first to share these kinds of concerns over the buyout. The $20 billion in debt is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">something several other industry figures have already pointed to as a problem</a>, and that's even before getting into the creative concerns, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">even as EA claims it will "<em>maintain creative control</em>" after the buyout</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/maxis-promises-the-sims-values-remain-unchanged-amidst-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout/"><strong>The Sims</strong> developer <strong>Maxis</strong> made a similar claim earlier this month,</a> saying its values will remain "<em>unchanged</em>" after the acquisition, a claim that players are struggling to believe. There's already precedent for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly impacting creative decisions in <strong>Fatal Fury</strong></a>, which itself is realistically a small matter in the grand scheme of things, since it can be boiled down to the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly using its influence to put a sports icon it has financial ties to in this new video game it owns. Not the worst thing in the world.</p>



<p>But if the group were to have used its influence for a small, ultimately trivial matter like that, it's understandable that The Sims players would have concerns that core elements to the long-running life sim, like being able to act out whatever lifestyle you want, including ones that are considered criminal offences in Saudi Arabia, would change.</p>



<p>And while we've not yet seen reports of Maxis employees voicing their concerns, anonymously or not, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/">employees at EA's <strong>BioWare</strong> have already done so</a>. There's simply no getting around the fact that this deal has a lot of people, inside and outside of EA, seriously concerned.</p>



<p>Of course, these concerns could be all for naught, and the deal could go through, and all of the bad things people fear will happen won't actually happen. We won't know until the deal officially closes, and we won't see that happen until the FTC and other global regulators weigh in on the deal.</p>
