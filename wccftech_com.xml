			<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's Silent Hill Transmission developer stream</a>, KONAMI shared a new trailer and many details about the upcoming horror game Silent Hill f. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and the spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a>, it features an original story set in 1960s Japan, more specifically in a remote mountain town called Ebisugaoka.</p>
<p>Here, teenager Shimizu Hinako has led a fairly unremarkable life, until a thick fog descends, transforming her home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles and battle terrifying entities to survive. Faced with impossible choices, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, and face the horrors that await within the mist.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, which previously worked as a developer partner on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Marvel's Avengers, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This will be their first high-profile game as a lead developer.&nbsp;The producer is Motoi Okamoto, who has already worked on the highly successful Silent Hill 2 remake, while the writer is Ryukishi07, renowned for Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry. On the developer stream, he said:</p>
<p><em>To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It's an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I've poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don't think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.</em></p>
<p><em>To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it's a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person's heart and mind. It's my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you'll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.</em></p>

<p>Ryukishi07 is not the only famed artist involved with the creation of Silent Hill f. Illustrator and monster designer kera is working on the game's artistic style, while legendary series composer Akira Yamaoka returns to compose the music for the game's Fog World. He's splitting work with fellow composer Kensuke Inage (Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, Tekken 8), who's composing the music for the game's Otherworld.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with no announced release date. However, the game's Steam page already includes the minimum and recommended PC requirements.</p>
