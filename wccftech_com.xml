			<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate, the 2D-action platformer from developer Bitmap Bureau Ltd. and publisher Reef Entertainment, has been delayed for a third time, though thankfully, players who've been anticipating this old-school take on Terminator will still be able to play it on PC and console platforms before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>It was initially set to arrive on September 5, 2025, though ahead of that launch, it was pushed to October. After that, it was pushed to November 26, 2025, and twenty days ahead of that release date, it was pushed again to its current, and hopefully final release date, December 12, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you</em>," publisher Reef Entertainment began <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the third (and hopefully final) delay for Terminator 2D: No Fate. "<em>We know you've waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey</em>."</p>



<p>This delay is, unfortunately, once again caused by issues Reef Entertainment has had with regard to the physical editions of the game. Before, the issue was tariff and trade-based, with the different components needed for the physical editions. Now that it has all that sorted, it needs to put the physical editions together.</p>



<p>"<em>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions,</em> <em>which we need some time to do. Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey.</p><p>The physical components for all editions have now…</p></div>— Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that players are left waiting a little longer, but delaying the game not for issues with the game itself, but for issues with the physical release, is commendable because it speaks to the publisher wanting everyone who is going to grab Terminator 2D: No Fate at launch, whether they're buying the physical edition or digital version, the same day-one experience. </p>

<p>At least it's still arriving before the end of the year, and Termiantor fans will have something to play while they wait for Terminator: Survivors, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">still has no release date despite being given a 2025 release window in August 2024</a>.</p>

			<p>Former <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developers</a> in Finland came together to form a new studio called Channel37 back in 2021. Four years later, as of today, that studio has released its debut project, The Last Caretaker, in early access on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>It's a survival building and crafting game where you step into the circuitry of a care-taking robot who wakes up to a world that is, quite literally, underwater. You go about waking up the ship you're on, and once your ship's engine is back up and running, the journey towards saving humanity begins, as you explore the vast ocean and hunt for the resources you need to improve your ship, and complete your ultimate goal: saving humanity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last Caretaker - Early Access Launch trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZgDWk0xFNU?start=84&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Along with this early access launch, Channel37 revealed its roadmap for the game, which seems to hint towards the studio looking to get the 1.0 version of The Last Caretaker out sometime next year. Its first major update is coming before the end of this year, which will add new modules, night vision, a new node questline, warehouses, caves, and a basketball game. </p>



<p>Then in 2026, Channel37 has four major updates planned, one to start the year, two in the spring, and one in the summer. Assuming none of those updates get delayed, we could be looking at a release date for the 1.0 version of the game, aligning with its early access release date today.</p>

<p>"<em>We're delighted to share our vision with players, and are committed to the long-term future for The Last Caretaker</em>," said co-founder of Channel37, Antti Ilvesuo. "<em>We wanted to make a world that feels like it could exist; it's survival that makes sense. Sharing this roadmap now shows our intention, and we'll deliver all of this and more as we head toward full launch in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>Whether you grab The Last Caretaker on Steam or the Epic Games Store, make sure you have the latest graphics drivers, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">NVIDIA confirmed it will support DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation and Super Resolution</a>. You can also play it through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>, if you prefer.</p>

			<p>On the first GeForce NOW media blast of the month, NVIDIA has outlined the planned roadmap of PC games that will be added to the cloud gaming service throughout November 2025.</p>



<p>Chief among them is, without a doubt, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The game developed by Treyarch Software will be available from day one via GeForce NOW. Granted, its PC specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-trailer-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are definitely not too demanding</a>, and playing a competitive first-person shooter isn't something I would advise even with the latest upgrades brought by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new RTX 5080-class servers</a>, but having the option is always nice.</p>



<p>Other highlights include Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, Where Winds Meet, and Project Motor Racing. Here's the full list of PC games due to be added throughout November:</p>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> (New release on Steam, Nov. 13)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where Winds Meet</a> (New release on Epic Games Store, Nov. 14)</li>
