			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5-6-seasons-says-lead-cast-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that lead cast actor Aaron Moten expects the Amazon Prime Video Fallout TV series to last five or six seasons, based on conversations with the showrunners. A few hours later, Amazon officially renewed the show for a third season, while also announcing that the second season will air on Prime Video this December.</p>
<p>Vernon Sanders, global head of television at Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout. Jonah Nolan, Lisa Joy, Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Graham Wagner have done an exceptional job bringing this beloved video game franchise to vivid life on Prime Video. Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and Bethesda Softworks, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of Season Two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy stated:</p>
<p><em>The holidays came a little early this year – we are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season of Fallout. On behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners Geneva and Graham, and our partners at Bethesda, we’re grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.</em></p>
<p>Showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner added:</p>
<p><em>We’re so grateful to have survived the apocalypse for another season! Thanks to the incredible team — our whole cast and crew, Kilter, and Amazon.</em></p>
<p>The news came at Amazon Prime Video's Upfront presentation, which was held yesterday at New York’s Beacon Theater. As befitting such an announcement, we also got a season two teaser that you can see below, providing us with the first look at New Vegas in the Fallout TV series.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Fallout TV series takes place around fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, and the showrunners have already clarified that fans of the game will see a much-changed location. Still, there's little doubt that the debut of season two will once again see the fan-favorite game skyrocket up the most-played charts.</p>
