			<p>PC gaming has dominated the mainstream markets over the past decade, as revealed in this <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">new report</a> by Epyllion. Traditionally, video game markets have always favored console platforms in terms of product launches, given that the PC version often comes years after the mainstream release, but despite this disparity, it seems like PC gaming has managed to compete in the gaming segment tremendously. Epyllion's newest report has revealed that PC gaming consumer revenue share has grown by up to 20% in years, while console revenue has "stagnated," showing the interest around both platforms.</p>
<p>The data reveals that while both platforms have seen exponential growth over the years, it seems like PC gaming has seen a stronger momentum, which has certainly been reflected in the revenue figures. Since the last decade, PC gaming has been said to bring in up to 220% higher revenue than the console platform, which is indeed astonishing, considering how the general notion is that consoles have contributed more to the gaming industry in general.</p>

<p>Epyllion claims that the platform's growth over the years is due to its "compounding advantages" over the console platform and a more interactive environment, which means backward compatibility and greater control over the gaming performance of the respective systems. Along with this, the sluggish selling momentum of consoles has also been attributed to the figures, which is why PC gaming has seen accelerated progress over the past few years, especially after 2021.</p>
<p>Whatever platform emerges at the top, it's safe to say that this progress is ultimately healthy for the gaming markets since the revenue figures rising over the years mean we are witnessing sustainable growth. Let us know which platform you prefer, PC or console, and why.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>
