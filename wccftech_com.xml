			<p>Larian Studios made quite the splash at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> when it revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">its next project would be Divinity,</a> a continuation of the other major fantasy RPG series under its belt, and the one that's actually bigger than Baldur's Gate 3. Even though the reveal was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/">spoiled ahead of the actual show</a>, it was still one of the night's highlights and had everyone excited about what's coming next from Larian.</p>



<p>Now, the tone around Larian Studios has changed, just days after The Game Awards, thanks to some recent comments and confirmation from the studio's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke. <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">In a recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed a few interesting tidbits about Divinity. Like Baldur's Gate 3, it'll be a turn-based RPG. Vincke also claimed that it'll be "<em>way better"</em> than Baldur's Gate 3, and the point that's making players upset online is that Vincke also confirmed Larian Studios has incorporated generative AI technology into its development pipeline.</p>



<p>On generative AI use at Larian, Vincke admitted to Bloomberg that there's been some internal pushback in the studio, but concluded that "<em>I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it</em>."</p>



<p>That may be true for some of its developers, but once the interview was live, it wasn't just players who are against generative AI use getting about Larian using the technology - it was also former Larian developers.</p>







<p>Amidst comments like this from a former Larian Studios developer and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/larianstudios/comments/1po3oz5/disappointed_in_larian_using_generative_ai_during/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">several comments on Reddit</a> and Bluesky, Vincke has responded to the backlash<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"> with a statement sent to IGN</a>, where he tries to quell the concerns over how Larian is using generative AI and clarify that Larian isn't looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI technology, nor will it be releasing a game that includes content made by generative AI.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement below, via IGN:</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators. Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use. Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</em></p>



<p><em>Any ML (machine learning) tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft. We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse</em>."</p>



<p>In what you'd call less formal wording, Vincke also <a href="https://x.com/laratlarian/status/2001011042642505833">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to respond to the criticisms he and Larian Studios are facing over using generative AI.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p><p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p><p>I was asked explicitly about concept art…</p></div>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If nothing else, this whole debacle has proven that generative AI technology and its use in game development are still hot-button issues that can have players turning on you in a flash. Some people, generally studio heads and company leaders, are not only fine with using GenAI, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they're also pushing for it everywhere</a>. Studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">already experimenting with it</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">using it in games</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">are currently available for you to buy right now</a>, games that have sold millions of copies.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">Others don't think it should be used at all</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dan-houser-calls-people-pushing-genai-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">others are calling it a crutch or a sign of someone who isn't very creative to begin with</a>, if they feel the need to use generative AI. Whatever side of the debate you are on, it's clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">people care about generative AI being used in games</a>. The question remains, though, will they care enough to vote with their wallets against developers who continue to use the tech, even ones that they previously loved? </p>



<p>Apropos of nothing, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">caught earlier this year having used generative AI tech for assets that made it into the final game</a>. The studio never acknowledged the complaints and quietly patched them out. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">it won a record number of awards at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year, <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472">and according to Alinea Analytics</a>, sold another 200,000 copies following the show.</p>

			<p>During The Game Awards 2025, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch date of PRAGMATA, its long-awaited new sci-fi intellectual property. Originally unveiled before the debut of the PlayStation 5 console as a 'next-generation' title, the game suffered multiple delays and was at one point thought to be going the way of Deep Down, another CAPCOM IP that vanished into thin air.</p>



<p>However, CAPCOM reintroduced it this year with trailers, hands-on opportunities at conventions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom</a>, and finally, the release date, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rating by the South Korean board</a>. Moreover, the developers also released a free demo called 'Sketchbook' that allows players to try the unique blend of hacking and fighting that makes up the core mechanics.</p>



<p>Firstly, as part of the release date news and demo availability, the developers have shared the official PC system requirements, which are listed below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 (64 bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5‑8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7‑8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>40 GB available space</td><td>40 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Additional Notes</strong></td><td>Estimated performance on “Performance” preset: 1080p/45 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. SSD recommended.</td><td>Estimated performance on “Balanced” preset: 1080p/60 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB required for ray tracing. SSD recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As evidenced by the specs themselves, PRAGMATA does not aim to be the next Crysis. Indeed, CAPCOM themselves admitted <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-gave-pragmata-an-early-steam-demo-to-make-sure-the-full-release-runs-smoothly-across-a-wide-range-of-pcs-we-ask-the-developers-about-their-optimization-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Automaton Media</a> that their priority was to prioritize a solid frame rate 'even if it meant sacrificing certain graphical aspects'. In that conversation, the development team also revealed why PC was the first platform to receive a demo (console demos will be released later): this allows them to gather feedback from gamers and optimize the game across the virtually countless PC configurations that can be created with existing components.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRAGMATA PC 'Sketchbook' Demo 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1iM1DDPK74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Based on my time with the demo, I'd say PRAGMATA, which is powered by the RE Engine like every recent CAPCOM game, already runs very well, at least on a high-end PC. At 4K resolution and every single graphics setting pushed to the max, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLAA (AI-powered anti-aliasing while rendering at native resolution), on an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition GPU, the demo averaged 173 frames per second. That's with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation enabled; there is currently no support for Multi-Frame Generation, so it was set to 2x. AMD users can enable FSR Frame Generation, and for the upscaling component, they can choose between AMD FSR 3.1.4 and AMD FSR 1.</p>



<p>More importantly, FLAT (the Frame Analytics Latency Tool software) registered a very low stuttering 'share' of 3,68%, much lower than most PC games, which range from 8-10%, let alone the worst example so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-performance-test-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with its 20,29% of stuttering time</a>. Indeed, subjectively, the demo felt smooth and almost entirely stutter-free.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PRAGMATA_SKETCHBOOK_DEMO_FLAT-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Now, it also didn't stand out particularly for its visuals. With the game taking place in relatively small interiors, at least based on the demo, perhaps CAPCOM could have delivered more detailed environments and assets as a whole. Still, based on the aforementioned statement, it was not their priority; they wanted to focus on performance instead. The game is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, as announced at The Game Awards 2025, and I can see it performing well even there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, those seeking a stunning game to show off their shiny new graphics card may want to look elsewhere. Granted, PC users will likely be able to inject path tracing through mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as was the case with previous RE Engine games</a>. CAPCOM only natively added ray traced reflections and indirect lighting to this game, whereas Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature native path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>The excellent performance exhibited by the PRAGMATA demo would be even better news if this were a challenging action game akin to Ninja Gaiden 4, to name one. However, this is not that kind of game. It's meant to be a far more relaxed experience, though I personally do hope that CAPCOM adds a Hard difficulty level before launch, as the demo felt far too easy.</p>



<p>Still, I largely enjoyed my experience with the demo and look forward to playing the full game when it launches on April 24, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
