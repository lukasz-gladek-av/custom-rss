			<p>Red Dead Redemption may be coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a fresh finding.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the ESRB posted <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">a new rating</a> for the classic Old West open-world game developed by Rockstar Games for the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo current-generation systems. <span>The rating is unsurprisingly identical to the ones of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39915/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39512/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PlayStation 4,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39439/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;ports, an M for Mature 17+ due to the presence of blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, and more.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-new-port-of-red-dead-redemption">What's The Point of a New Port of Red Dead Redemption?</h2>



<p>Today's rating is somewhat surprising as Red Dead Redemption is already playable on all three systems via backward compatibility. As such, a new native release for current-generation systems can only mean that some new technical features should be included. In regard to content, no surprise should be expected due to the rating summary being identical across all versions of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-red-dead-redemption-be-improved-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s">How Can Red Dead Redemption Be Improved on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The new Red Dead Redemption console ports may finally offer 60 FPS and beyond gameplay on all systems.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the game can be played on current-generation consoles via backward compatibility, the experience may not be the best for the most demanding players, as 60 FPS gameplay is only available on PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PlayStation 4</th><th>Nintendo Switch</th><th>Xbox Series X|S</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1080p (PS4), upscaled to 4K on PS5</td><td>1080p docked / 720p handheld</td><td>1440p on Series S<br>Native 4K on Series X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 FPS (locked), 60 FPS on PlayStation 5</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance Enhancements</strong></td><td>Stable frame pacing, improved texture filtering</td><td>Optimized for handheld and docked play</td><td>Enhanced resolution, improved filtering, Auto-HDR</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">PC port of Red Dead Redemption, on the other hand, is the most advanced</a>, offering up to 144 FPS gameplay, among other improvements that set it decisively above every other version of the game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Red Dead Redemption PC Port Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution Support</strong></td><td>Up to native 4K resolution and ultrawide monitor support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>Up to 144 FPS support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong></td><td>Improved textures, enhanced shadows, updated anti-aliasing, higher draw distance, and overall graphical refinements, HDR 10 support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Features</strong></td><td>NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.0, DLSS Frame Generation Support</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Considering the PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S have the horsepower to run what's basically an enhanced port of a PS3, Xbox 360 era game at high resolution and framerates, it's very likely the new Red Dead Redemption console ports will attempt to reach parity with the PC version in this regard. </p>



<p>Hopefully, a few more surprises will also be included in this new port, but even without any, improved resolution and framerates should be more than enough to make Red Dead Redemption an enjoyable experience on modern consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been two years since Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced the Steam Deck OLED</a>, a revision of the handheld gaming device originally released on the market in February 2022. Back then, fans of the device had already been clamoring for a proper, more powerful new iteration, but Valve had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-might-not-arrive-until-2025-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that a Steam Deck 2 wouldn't be released until 2025 or 2026 because the technology they were looking for <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-0-doesnt-exist-because-technology-is-not-there-yet-valve-is-working-on-games-designed-for-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was simply not yet available</a>.</p>



<p>The Steam hardware family is officially set to expand early next year with the launch of the Frame headset, the new Steam Machine, and the new Steam Controller; however, there's no new Deck in sight yet. IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Valve once again</a>, and Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais reiterated that it still isn't time yet, although the company now has a good idea of what it's going to be. </p>



<p><em>Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product. We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SOC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck. </em></p>



<p>It sounds like we'll have to wait until the latter half of 2027, in all likelihood, which could put the new Deck in direct competition with the PlayStation handheld that Sony is working on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's expected to offer a performance level similar to the base PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<p>Given that both devices will be powered by AMD technology, they could end up with similar performance if they are released near each other at a comparable price. Of course, there are too many unknowns at this point, which is expected given that these devices are a couple of years away. Still, keep following Wccftech to remain updated on the latest leaks, rumors, and news.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-%E2%80%98really-competitive%E2%80%99-with-building-a-similar-pc-yourself-says-valve.1352203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Valve's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio of hardware announcements</a> (the Steam Machine, the Steam Frame, and the Steam Controller), the biggest question users were left with was pricing. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to IGN</a>, Valve's Hardware Engineer Yazan Aldehayyat did not shy from sharing a few things about the pricing of the Steam Machine, stating that it will be very competitive with building a PC with similar hardware. </p>



<p><em>If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it. The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible.</em></p>



<p>Let's take another look at the specifications, then.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Valve claims it arrived at these hardware specifications after carefully analyzing the Steam hardware survey, with the goal of enabling 4K@60Hz performance in all Steam games (through upscaling). However, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rv83LgXiN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that in their early test at Valve, Cyberpunk 2077 ran at 1440p@60FPS upscaled to 4K, but dropped to 30 frames per second as soon as they enabled ray traced reflections and sun shadows. The folks at DF estimate the performance of the Steam Machine to be positioned somewhere between an Xbox Series S and a PlayStation 5, possibly closer to the latter.</p>



<p>The Xbox Series S is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at $379.99</a> (in its 512GB model), while the PlayStation 5 (digital edition) <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costs $499.99</a>. Both consoles received price hikes this year, mainly due to the tariffs. Still, if Valve really wants to break into the living room this time around, it needs to be competitive with them, not just with a PC, which is notoriously more expensive. At the very least, it should cost less than the PlayStation 5 Pro (currently priced at $749.99), being far less powerful on paper. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, South Korean developer NCSOFT (Lineage, Aion, Throne and Liberty) took the stage at G-Star 2025 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> the long-rumored Horizon Steel Frontiers MMORPG. The game, which is targeting a launch on PC and mobile, is a collaboration between the studio and franchise holder Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>The announcement provided a few initial and fairly vague details, such as the region (the Deadlands, modeled after Arizona and New Mexico) the game will take place in, the fact that players will cooperate to take down machines but also compete for resources and fight against rival tribes, and the tweaks made to the combat system. The developers claim there will be new mechanics, such as climbing onto a damaged machine part with the Pullcaster to set traps and inflict status effects, picking up weapons dropped during battle, carrying them on your mount, and using them at a later time. Perhaps the biggest difference shown in the debut Horizon Steel Frontiers gameplay, though, is the addition of greatswords. Whereas Aloy only ever used a spear for melee while heavily favoring bows, it looks like this game will allow proper melee combat with parries and counterattacks.</p>



<p>What neither the announcement video nor the official press release mentioned was any launch window. However, NCSOFT executives spoke about it two days ago during the company's <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/ncsoft/ncsoft.php?c=ncsoft&amp;y=3230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 2025 earnings call</a>. They were confident that it could launch in 2026 or early 2027 and also boasted of having received acclaim from those who had already played it.</p>



<p><em>Internally, the development has progressed pretty significantly, so we think that based on the development progress, it would be available to be launched either next year or early two years from now, but we need to discuss the specifics with the IP holder. What I want to emphasize is that significant progress has been made in development, so with refinement, we will be able to release this title, too. Everyone gave us a round of applause after viewing the demonstration and playing the game firsthand.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with game development becoming increasingly complex, especially for an MMORPG, I would say there's a solid chance we'll see it in 2027. Still, that NCSOFT thinks it could launch as early as next year suggests we could at least be able to try the game in pre-release testing events throughout 2026.</p>
