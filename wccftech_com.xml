			<p><strong>Amazon</strong>'s divestment from gaming investments continues today with the news that the company has canceled its publishing deal with <strong>Maverick Games</strong>. This decision follows the shutdown of Amazon's MMO divisions that were working on <strong>New World</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> game</a>, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-shut-down-april-2026-amazon-glowmade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week's shutdown of <strong>King of Meat</strong></a> (and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent departure of division chief <strong>Christoph Hartmann</strong></a>). Essentially, Amazon's current gaming investments are just the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> games from <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and the cloud-based platform <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna</a></strong>.</p>



<p>A spokesperson <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Game Business</a>:</p>



<p><em>As part of our strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon’s unique strengths and scale, including the recent re-launch of Luna and our Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics, we have decided to release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios.</em></p>



<p><em>We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating. This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future.</em></p>



<p>Maverick Games <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-former-developers-announce-new-aaa-studio-maverick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was founded in early 2023 by former Forza Horizon developers</a></strong>. The studio is still working on an open world driving game targeting a release on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S and X. Today, they released a statement to thank Amazon for the opportunity and to <strong>reassure fans that they're committed to the project and are currently in talks with other partners to replace Amazon in the publishing role</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NACON Files for Insolvency Just Days Before Its NACON Connect Showcase]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>This morning, French publisher&nbsp;<strong>NACON</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for insolvency</a>, following a major issue with its majority shareholder, </span><strong><span>Bigben Interac</span>tive</strong>. On November 24, 2025, Bigben announced <strong>it had secured a refinancing agreement with a banking pool of leading French banks for €43 million</strong>, repayable over 6 years. This would have partially refinanced prior outstanding bonds, leaving a non-refinanced residual balance of approximately €16.1 million to be repaid separately on the maturity date. </p>



<p>However, on February 13, 2026, just four business days before the maturity date, t<strong>he banking pool informed Bigben that it was refusing to honor the drawdown notice sent in connection with the refinancing</strong>, claiming it could invoke a breach by Bigben for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. <strong>Bigben strongly disputed this legal analysis and reserved all its rights</strong>. The refusal was described as both unexpected and late, leaving Bigben (and, therefore, Nacon) with almost no time to find an alternative.</p>



<p>Unable to proceed with the partial repayment of the aforementioned €43 million, last week Bigben announced <strong>the temporary suspension of trading</strong> in its shares on Euronext Paris and its bonds on Euronext Access Paris. NACON, as a subsidiary, had its own shares suspended simultaneously.</p>



<p>Today, the two companies filed different court procedures reflecting their different situations. Bigben filed for an amicable conciliation procedure, stressing it would have no impact on operations, employees, or customers. Bigben also noted that its principal asset is its majority stake in NACON, <strong>in which it holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NACON's situation appears to be more severe</strong>, though. Unable to meet its own liabilities as a direct consequence of the parent company's crisis, it filed for full judicial reorganisation proceedings. This freezes existing liabilities for an observation period of up to 18 months while the company attempts to develop a continuation plan. Essentially, NACON has formally acknowledged that it cannot meet its current liabilities. The procedure gives it court protection while it attempts to restructure, but the outcome is, at this point, genuinely uncertain. If no viable continuation plan emerges within the observation period, <strong>liquidation becomes a very real possibility</strong>.</p>



<p>It's all a bit surreal for fans of NACON's games, even more so because the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-connect-returns-next-week-edge-of-memories-the-mound-cthulhu-cosmic-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just announced</a> this Monday that <strong>a new NACON Connect Showcase will go live on March 4, 2026</strong>, providing updated news and footage on upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-visions-of-mana-but-in-a-good-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition-jumping-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, NACON currently owns the following 16 AA development studios that altogether employ more than a thousand developers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nacon Studio Milan</li>



<li>Big Ant Studios</li>



<li>Daedalic Entertainment</li>



<li>Cyanide</li>



<li>Midgar Studio</li>



<li>RaceWard Studio</li>



<li>Neopica</li>



<li>Ishtar Games</li>



<li>Crea-ture Studios</li>



<li>Eko Software</li>



<li>Kylotonn</li>



<li>Spiders</li>
</ul>

			<p>In the year of the company's <strong>35th anniversary</strong>, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> president <strong>Johanna Faries</strong> wants to usher in a new era for the revered game developer, and that includes <strong>the expansion of its franchises into cinema and TV</strong>. In an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/blizzard-plans-updates-diablo-wow-overwatch-johanna-faries-1236670302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>, Faries stated:</p>



<p><em>We talk a lot about this. We’re not Blizzard Games, we’re Blizzard Entertainment. We want to be able to show up on every screen imaginable. We want to be able to create new fans who may not have been with us for the past 35 years. How we continue to engage Hollywood or film and TV in bigger ways is going to be, in the near term, probably a big part of that recipe. We also play in music. We also play in non-traditional spaces, beyond gaming, certainly.</em></p>



<p><em>I would confidently say that every one of our IPs could be some of the greatest linear media experiences that the world could experience. So more to come on the specifics. What I will say is that there are highly generative, proactive, near-term discussions across almost every one of our worlds right now, with respect to what can we do, what format works, who’s the right team to take that to new audiences in a high caliber way</em>.</p>



<p>It is indeed a bit strange that Blizzard didn't pursue transmedia opportunities more. Sure, there was the <strong>$160 million live-action Warcraft movie</strong> released in 2016 with a strong cast (Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Clancy Brown, and Ruth Negga), but it didn't exactly earn a great critical or box office success. Beyond that, fans of the main franchises (<strong>Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Diablo</strong>, <strong>Starcraft</strong>, and <strong>Overwatch</strong>) were largely left wanting.</p>



<p>Faries is definitely correct that <strong>each of them could be a great source for adaptations</strong>. Ultimately, it all depends on the team behind the project. Historically, adaptations from game IPs haven't done that well, but that has changed dramatically in the last few years with the likes of <strong>Sonic</strong>, <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, and <strong>Super Mario</strong>, thanks to filmmakers who understood the worlds they were adapting. Even the second and final season of the <strong>Halo</strong> TV show showed significant improvements, although the series was still ultimately canceled. Hopefully, other projects like the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-series-announced-craig-mazin-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a></strong> series follow the same golden rule.</p>
