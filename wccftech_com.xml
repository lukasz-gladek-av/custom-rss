			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> about NetEase effectively pulling out of several of its investments out of China, fans of the promising action role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker were worried about its future. After all, developer Rebel Wolves did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> receiving an investment from NetEase in November 2022.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, this game&nbsp;<span>isn't in any danger, as Co-Owner and Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc clarified&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a> earlier today. NetEase is just a minority investor, and Rebel Wolves has already</span>&nbsp;found another publisher (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandai Namco</a>) for this game.</p>
<p><em>I've also read the articles suggesting that Rebel Wolves may be in danger due to the rumoured situation at NetEase. First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues.</em></p>
<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves.</em><br>
<em>NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founded by former developers of The Witcher 3</a>, the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> The Blood of Dawnwalker in mid-January, showing a promising title that blends a narrative focus with lots of player agency. In the game, players will take the role of Coen, a vampire from 14th century Carpathia who - as implied by the title - can also walk in the sun. Following the Black Death plague, his homeland has been invaded by a powerful coven of vampires, and it will be up to him to stop them and rescue his family. There will also be a time limit of thirty days and thirty nights to do so. The gameplay loop will be different at nighttime, with a more supernatural twist that shows off Coen's vampire powers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the players will have many choices to make in what the studio is calling a 'narrative sandbox'. Rebel Wolves did say not to expect a huge game in terms of scope and playtime like The Witcher 3, though, which is understandable given that it is a new studio. The game has no release date yet, but the developers will reveal more about The Blood of Dawnwalker later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-starts-after-february-26-maintenance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next major update to Infinity Nikki will be coming soon and will launch after server maintenance takes place on February 26. The new season will launch on February 26 and will run until March 25, where players will be given the opportunity to explore the Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover all of the secrets that lay on the grounds. This comes in the form of a cursed song, and players will have to help out the legendary creature Bullquet in a sweet side quest. If you are interested in what the Eerie Season has to offer in Infinity Nikki, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The official trailer for Version 1.3 [Eerie Season] is now live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQG9MKHvB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Eerie Season will take players away from the vibrancy and pastel colors and instead transport them to a world filled with Gothic aesthetics, Supernatural phenomena, and new challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the ruins of Queen Philomia's palace, there have been peculiar singing voices that echo off of the walls of the palace, which has led people to believe that the ruins are cursed. Once the day turns to night, the melodies can be heard through the corridors, where the residents of Florawish have become unnerved and fear the grounds of the ruins. As a result of this, Nikki and Momo take a journey into the Queen's Palace Ruins, where there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The initial event will be named The Queen's Lament. Once players have completed this, they will then gain access to the Queen's Palace Ruins: Inner Court dungeon, which provides a new, scary challenge to take on.&nbsp; In addition, once players have cleared this dungeon, they will then be able to visit the high tower in the Queen's Palace Ruins at night, where they will be able to play the piano beside Ms. Glove.</p>
<p>Through the Eerie Season, players will be able to obtain 15 Revelation Crystals and a new outfit named the Dream Chaser completely for free. In the Heartfelt Gifts Store, there will be three more free outfits to obtain, which brings the grand total to nine free outfits throughout the history of Infinity Nikki. <a href="https://www.infoldgames.com/en/home#product">Infold Games</a> continues to be dedicated to the community of Infinity Nikki, and continues to work to optimize the game and ensure that players are having a good time playing the game, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-available-to-wishlist-on-steam/">title set to soon release</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience the Gothic and supernatural beauty of Eerie Season once it is released after the maintenance on February 26, where the season will then run until March 25.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is a more than worthy new entry in the series, but it fails to deliver a technically sound experience on consoles, with image quality and performance issues on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released their analysis of the console versions of the new entry in the series launching this week, detailing the three display modes featured on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and what exactly they deliver in terms of resolution and performance. Among the three modes, the only mode that delivers 60 FPS gameplay is Resolution mode, which targets 900p resolution but employs dynamic resolution that hits as low as 720p resolution in demanding sequences and as high as 1080p in lighter sequences. With such low resolutions, it is not surprising to see how Performance mode delivers disappointing image quality, featuring not only blurrier visuals than the other modes, but also some evident visual settings cutbacks, such as aggressive LOD behavior, simplified screen space reflections, and more. The game also uses AMD FSR 1 to upscale to 4K resolution with no temporal upsampling process, which only makes the visuals look worse.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds performance on consoles also leaves something to be desired, as Performance mode doesn't deliver smooth 60 FPS gameplay, with some frequent dips below the target that are only alleviated on a VRR-capable display. Resolution and Balanced mode do a better job at keeping their 30 and 40 FPS targets, though still with some drops. The uncapped framerate option also doesn't seem to be doing a lot, as all display modes run at their framerate target for the most part, with infrequent performance uplifts in light sequences.</p>
<p>With the more powerful current-generation systems struggling in certain scenarios, it's not surprising to see Monster Hunter Wilds look and run the worst out of all consoles on Xbox Series S. This version of the game not only sports worse image quality with even more visual cutbacks than Performance mode, such as the complete removal of screen space reflections and lower texture quality, but it also runs the worst, with frequent framerate drops from the 30 FPS that are far from ideal for a game like this.</p>

<p>On PC, sadly, things don't fare much better, and only top-end machines can run Monster Hunter Wilds at 60 frames per second and above. You can learn more about this version of the game with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
