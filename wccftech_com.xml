			<p>Liminal Experiences, Inc is a brand-new UGC gaming startup that is dedicated to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to help boost human-centered creativity. It's announced that it has raised $5.8 million to date in seed funding. Some of those who have backed the company are very large names in the games industry, including BITKRAFT Ventures, Riot Games, and OTK Media Group. The investors also include Marc Merrill, Founder of Riot Games.</p>
<p>Liminal is still currently in development and has a planned release for an Alpha in 2026, where it will transform creation into a game, where it will then make it possible for players to create their own RPG-style adventures from ideas, with AI handling all of the difficult parts. The AI tools will allow people to craft their own worlds as they see fit, as well as create their own characters, and even collaborate with friends to make a bigger adventure overall.</p>
<p>"AI in gaming is a sensitive topic, as many developers worry about <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-simpsons-voice-actor-believes-ai-will-replace-his-work/">being replaced</a>, and players grapple with its ethical issues," says Liminal Experiences Founder and CEO, Brendan Mulligan. "Wading into the debate is fraught, so most gaming companies avoid discussing AI while quietly exploring options internally. This leaves the public conversation to startups founded by tourists to the industry to pitch their vision of the future. There's a real need for studios willing to stand for a positive vision of an AI-enabled future, which should come from developers focused on unleashing, not replacing, human creativity."</p>
<p>Liminal will come with some key features to help it stand out from the sea of ongoing AI development tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation through play of 3D episodic adventure stories, no coding needed</li>
<li>Full building, decorating, and character editing systems</li>
<li>Easy quest creation and advanced gameplay editing</li>
<li>AI-powered storytelling assistance and game creation concierge</li>
<li>Seamless creation and sharing of adventures with 1-4 players</li>
</ul>
<p>While the website doesn't have much to offer thus far, there will be the option to sign up to be a <a href="https://liminal.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play tester</a> of the new tool once it releases in Alpha in 2026.</p>
<p>With Liminal, Mulligan believes that this tool will ensure that the future of gaming is kept alive and fresh as players young and old will be able to discover their own creativity and put their stories into something playable for an audience, where creation becomes possible for anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>"A positive vision of the future should recognize the power of AI to ignite the imaginations of players of all ages, letting everyone realize the fantasy of making their own game experiences."</p>
