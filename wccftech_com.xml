			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Squad 22: ZOV</a> is a new squad tactics game that just released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/">Steam</a> yesterday, and claims to be "<em>officially recommended</em>" by the Russian military "<em>for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>, the game's <a href="https://squad22.online/">website</a> claims that the development team includes soldiers currently fighting in the war between Ukraine and Russia, and claims that it shows "<em>History as it</em> <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>The website reads,"<em>Dive into 2014 and 2022-2024 events, through different campaigns and learn how people who lived in them saw what happened, how it affected their lives and changed opinions</em>."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has already published articles about Squad 22: ZOV, and how it is Russian military propaganda that aims to "<em>mythologize the war and its participants</em>" from Russia's point of view, to bring young Russian men into the fold of the army.</p>
<p>"<em>The Squad 22: ZOV game is not just entertainment, but an element of propaganda aimed at justifying the war and creating a heroic myth about the Russian</em> <em>military,</em>" the Center for Countering Disinformation writes.</p>
<p>"<em>This is another step in the militarization of Russian society and its preparation for a long-term war.</em>"</p>
<p>It's unclear how exactly Squad 22: ZOV was able to get its Steam listing and pass through moderation checks. Valve has not yet commented on the game, nor has it taken action to remove the game like it recently did with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">game explicitly depicting sexual violence</a>, or how it removed a game depicting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA announced today that the GeForce NOW native Steam Deck application, previously announced at CES 2025, is now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for download</a>.</p>
<p>It was already possible to run GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck via the built-in browser. However, that wasn't an optimal solution. Even the installation has been streamlined, as users can just download the app from the official website and follow the instructions to install it on their portable device. NVIDIA says that playing a game via its cloud gaming platform can consume up to 50% less battery life compared to running the same game natively on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck supports streaming at up to 1440p 120 FPS when connected to a<br>
monitor or 4K 60 FPS when connected to a TV. NVIDIA will further improve the GeForce NOW<br>
streaming experience and is looking to add new features, including support for 90 FPS in a future update.</p>
<p>HDR10 is supported on GeForce NOW for premium members (those subscribed to the Ultimate or Performance tier). It works when using the Steam Deck in handheld mode (provided that you've got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck OLED</a>, since the original model does not support HDR10) or when connected to a TV or monitor. Of course, if you're subscribed to those tiers, you'll also enjoy RTX features such as ray tracing/path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and Reflex on supported games.</p>
<p>Speaking of games, today's GeForce NOW Thursday also reveals six new PC games to the ever-growing GeForce NOW library:</p>
<p>● Nice Day for Fishing (New release on Steam, May 29)<br>
● Cash Cleaner Simulator (Steam)<br>
● Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Steam)<br>
● The Last Spell (Steam)<br>
● Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon (Steam)<br>
● Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</p>
