			<p>The rumored portable edition of the PlayStation 6 won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, according to information shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking last month on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-3#post-270213490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, as reported today on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywrgn/kepler_says_the_portable_ps6_is_a_15w_soc_on_3nm/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 revealed that the portable edition of the next-generation console by Sony won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, as it will be powered by a 15W SoC on 3nm. As the system is said to be able to run PS5 games, it will definitely be interesting to see how the portable system will be able to do so and which compromises will have to be made to achieve this.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 6 as of now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard again from Kepler L2 that the SoC is design complete and entered pre-silicon validation with A0 tapeout scheduled for later this year. While this doesn't tell us much about the console, the usual timeframe from A0 tapeout and release is 2 years, so there's a chance the system will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for certain about the PlayStation 6 is that it will once again be powered by AMD. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Last year</a>, it was confirmed that Intel also bid to produce the console, but ultimately AMD won due to a dispute at Intel over how much profit the company would make from each chip sold to Sony, which prevented the company from deciding on a price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie unveiled its new team-based extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> over the weekend, giving us our first honest look at the gameplay and a release date to look forward to. However, we did not get any idea about how much it would cost.</p>
<p>We've known for some time now that Marathon will not be a free-to-play title. The current rumor is that it will be priced at the same level Concord was, at $40. After the weekend showcase went live, previews for Marathon from the press who attended a recent in-person event where they got to play the game and speak to members of Marathon's team at Bungie also went live. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's</a> preview seems to shed more light on how Marathon will be priced.</p>
<p>Bungie told GameSpot that Marathon will be a "<em>premium</em>" release. Though they did not provide a specific number or price range, Bungie did confirm that it would not be a "<em>full-priced</em> <em>title.</em>"</p>
<p>That might be clear as mud, but it at least officially confirms what was already rumored: Marathon will not be aiming for that $70 premium price tag that most triple-A games get. This keeps the $40 price point still firmly in the lead as to what the price of the game might actually be.</p>
<p>With that said, there's a good chance it could be even less than $40 because the significant remaining variable is how Sony will approach Marathon after watching Concord fail in such a big way last year. The two games aren't entirely comparable. Concord was made by a studio with nowhere near Bungie's legacy. Concord was entirely a brand-new series, unlike Marathon, which has an existing fan base that would be interested in trying this reboot of the series.</p>
<p>There's also likely a contingent of Bungie die-hard fans who will buy Marathon just to try the latest game from their favorite studio. Those factors alone make it very unlikely that Marathon crashes in the same way Concord did.</p>
<p>Still, it wouldn't be surprising if Sony chose to hedge its bets by making the barrier to entry for Marathon cheaper than it was for Concord. Pricing won't be the only factor in Marathon's success or lack thereof, but it will still play a big role. Hopefully, we'll have a better idea of the price soon.</p>

			<p>The STALKER 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Graphics mod</a> significantly improves the game's visuals without completely butchering performance, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the vanilla and modded game running side by side, highlighting the massive visual enhancements brought by improved Lumen GI, Reflections and Ambient Occlusion, increased Lumen draw distance for indirect lighting, improved overall shadow quality and ambient occlusion in vegetation, increased LOD distance for vegetation and geometry and more. While these enhancements obviously impact performance, the drop is not as massive as one might have expected, as the game still manages to run in the 50/60 FPS range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode on an RTX 5080 without Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Ultra Plus Graphics Mod vs Original - Pushing Unreal Engine 5 Visuals to its Limit!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjOzw07hdck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>STALKER 2 launched late last year on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S after a few delays. The game is a worthy successor to the original in every regard, offering an engaging experience that can be more than challenging at times, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 footage was shared online, providing a better look at how the demanding open-world by CD Projekt Red runs and looks on the next-generation Nintendo system in handheld mode.</p>
<p>The footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deck Wizard</a>, shows the game running on the system in Performance Mode, which targets 40 FPS. While there are some visible frame rate drops at times, which are likely to be addressed in the launch version, the game really seems to run great on Nintendo Switch 2 while also sporting great image quality, showing how the Nintendo system is more than capable of delivering a better experience than what can be achieved on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 First Look Hands-On Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Exx79Ikf6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch as the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion. The retail version of the game will also be playable without any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-40-fps-docked/">additional download</a>, as both the base game and expansion are included in the 64 GB big cart the game will ship onto.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, however, is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the United States could increase significantly, according to a supplier.</p>
<p>An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns">Nikkei Asia</a> highlights how game consoles made in China <a href="https://wccftech.com/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-have-reportedly-excluded-pc-smartphone-imports/">are still subject to a 145% tariff </a>in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a price increase</a> in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/"> Last week</a>, we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely</a>. You can learn more about the system by checking out Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/"> hands-on impressions.</a></p>
