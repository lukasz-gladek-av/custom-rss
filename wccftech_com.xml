			<p>A new rumor suggests <strong>Microsoft</strong> is preparing to use its <strong>layoff axe</strong> once again, for the <strong>fourth consecutive January</strong>, cutting between 11 and 22 thousand jobs across various divisions (including <strong>Xbox</strong>) because of the <strong>rising costs of AI investment</strong>. If the figures were confirmed, it would be the biggest layoff round yet.</p>



<p>The rumor <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from TipRanks</a>, which adds that the layoffs are expected to fall upon employees at some point <strong>in the third week of January</strong>. According to workers' anonymous sources, even the <strong>Azure</strong> cloud team could be affected.</p>



<p>Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion. Looking back over the past few years, the current <strong>fourth-largest company in the world by market capitalization</strong> reduced its workforce by 5% in <strong>2023</strong>, primarily as part of a resizing effort following the pandemic's mass hiring spree. That year in January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started with 10,000 jobs lost</a>, when the gaming teams affected were <strong>Bethesda</strong>, <strong>The Coalition</strong> (developers of <strong>Gears of War</strong>), and <strong>343 Industries</strong> (developers of the <strong>Halo </strong>series). </p>



<p>In January <strong>2024</strong>, gaming really took the brunt of the hit as Microsoft 'only' <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut <strong>1,900 employees</strong></a>, around 1% of its workforce. It happened just three months after the finalization of the acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, which cost <strong>$75.4 billion</strong> when all was said and done. Activision Blizzard was indeed the most affected studio, with the new survival game franchise codenamed <strong>Odyssey</strong> canceled as a result, but other teams at Xbox and Bethesda also suffered cuts. The worst was yet to come for gaming, though: <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> (<strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Redfall</strong>), <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong> (<strong>The Evil Within</strong>, <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>, <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>), <strong>Alpha Dog Games</strong>, and <strong>Roundhouse Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were all abruptly shut down in May 2024</a>. Later that year, around 1,000 employees were removed from the HoloLens and Azure cloud teams, and another 650 from corporate and support divisions, but it was still a relatively quiet year compared to the other two for Microsoft as a whole.</p>



<p><span><strong>2025</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>by far the worst</strong>, and it once again began with a January cut of slightly less than 1% of Microsoft's employees based on performance.</span> That was just the start: 3% of the workforce was cut in May, and an even heavier blow landed in July, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed another 4% of its employees</a>, shutting down <strong>The Initiative</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">and its </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark reboot</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"> project</a>) and cutting a lot of employees at <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> (leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>) and Rare (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">axing </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a></strong>). <strong>Turn 10 Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit hard</a>, too, essentially becoming a support studio for the <strong>Forza Horizon</strong> franchise following a few unsuccessful <strong>Forza Motorsport</strong> releases.</p>



<p>Following that round, a report from the inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft was 'trying their damndest' to <strong>replace human jobs with AI agents</strong>. A couple of days later, another report <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> that the layoff rounds were fundamentally needed <strong>to fund increased spending in AI infrastructure</strong>, and that seems to be the case even with the new round that might be announced soon.</p>



<p>The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week. Internally, some people view this new rule as a subtle way to encourage even more people to leave.</p>

			<p>For fans of sports games and racing games, there are a few titles they can expect to see each year. EA and 2K will always give sports game fans and racing game fans something to play. But for 2026, thankfully there's a bit more to look forward to than just your regular annualized titles.</p>



<p>It's an especially good year for racing fans, who have the return of a major franchise to look forward to, and a new high-speed, sci-fi racer that could very well surprise everyone to be one of the best arcade racing games to come around in a while.</p>



<p>If the following games meet their expectations, you might see them again when we do our 'Best of 2026' picks at the end of the year. For now, these are the sports and racing games we're most anticipating in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/">DLC/Expansion</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Action Games</a></em></strong>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/"> <em><strong>Shooters</strong></em></a>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Horror</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Forza Horizon 6 (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forza-Horizon-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 6. Image credit: Playground Games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 may not have been the surprise reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Xbox wanted it to be at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">due to it leaking</a> about a month ahead of the show, but it was still exciting to see nonetheless. Forza Horizon 5 is arguably one of the biggest racing games released in the past decade, and its follow-up looks set to surpass its predecessor in every way.</p>



<p>We still don't know a lot about it, nor do we know when in 2026 it'll aim to be out, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">recent reports point to it being an early 2026 release</a>. Hopefully, those reports are correct, and we'll be able to head to Japan in Forza Horizon 6 sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-tennis-fever-february-12-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Tennis Fever (February 12, 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mario-Tennis-Fever.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Tennis Fever. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mario's line of sports games can be hit and miss (pun intended). Sometimes, they're excellently crafted and amazingly replayable, particularly with a few friends huddled around one TV. Super Mario Strikers on Nintendo Wii comes to mind when I think of some Mario sports games that were way more fun than they had any right to be.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Aces, the last game in the Mario Tennis series, does not fall in the same category as Strikers, but Mario Tennis Fever, the next game in the series <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">due out on February 12, 2026, on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, just might. At least we can hope it will, since Mario is due for a fun arcade-y sports game.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars: Galactic Racer (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer.png"></a><figcaption><em>Star Wars Galactic Racer. Image credit: Fuse Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Now this is pod racing,' is what every Star Wars fan watching<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/"> The Game Awards 2025 said to themselves when we all collectively realized a new Star Wars racing game was coming our way</a>. At least it would have been, if there were vehicles in the trailer that actually looked like pod racers. </p>



<p>But even a bit of confusion over the lack of the death traps that Little Ani used to win himself out of slavery can't stop the excitement buzzing around the fact that Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a new racing game from Fuse Games, a studio formed by former Need for Speed and Burnout developers. It's frankly the kind of match-made-in-heaven that is equivalent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Star Wars: Galactic Racer is able to make a case for itself this year, and that when we talk about the best racing games of 2026 at the end of the year, Forza Horizon 6 has some company in the conversation.</p>



<h2 id="h-exo-rally-championship-tbc-2026-pc">Exo Rally Championship (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Exo-Rally-Fest.png"></a><figcaption><em>Exo Rally Championship. Image credit: Exbleative</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exo Rally Championship was one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">honourable mentions for our most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025</a>, and a year later, not only are we still looking forward to it, but we've moved it up to one of our main five picks for the year. It might not have the brand recognition of the other sci-fi racers on this list, but this off-road arcade racer from developer Exbleative and publisher Future Friends Games is absolutely worth keeping on your radar.</p>



<p>There's no definitive sign as to when it'll arrive, but hopefully last year's Steam Next Fest demo was an indication that the team is making enough progress that it'll be out before the end of 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-golf-with-your-friends-2-tbc-2026-pc">Golf With Your Friends 2 (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Golf-With-Your-Friends-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Radical Forge</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ending our main picks with something fairly different from the rest, Golf With Your Friends 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Golf With Your Friends, a chaotic multiplayer golf game that arrived all the way back in 2016. </p>



<p>In the last decade, Golf With Your Friends has steadily maintained its popularity in such a way that it's sequel could become one of the year's flash-in-the-pan multiplayer games that breaks through and rides the waves of content creators playing it with their friends on livestreams. It might not reach the heights of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a>, but it certainly feels like it has that kind of potential. </p>


<div id="democracy-1512" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1512,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Most Anticipated Sports and Racing Games of 2026</strong></p></div>
