			<p>After several of the titles joining the <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> game catalogues <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850">leaked yesterday evening</a>, <strong>PlayStation</strong> has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/">officially confirmed</a> all of the games that PS Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers will be getting access to for January 2026, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, </strong>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-full-release-owners-of-original-discount/"><strong>Darkest Dungeon</strong> <strong>II</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Once again, players paying top-dollar for the Premium subscription only get one game added to the Classics Catalog, which seems to continue a trend of Premium subscribers seemingly getting the short end of the stick. </p>



<p>That's not to say anything against Ridge Racer, more to say that while yes, Premium subscribers are also paying for the other games joining the Extra and Essential tiers each month, the Classics Catalog is one of the only key differences between Premium and the other tiers. Some months, no games enter the Classics Catalog. It simply has to leave those players wondering what they're paying for, if they can't expect the library of Classic games to actually grow at a reasonable rate.</p>



<p>Regardless, here is the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for January 2026, all of which will be available starting <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>



<li>Darkest Dungeon II (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4) - <strong>Premium-tier subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, PS Plus Essential subscribers (and every other tier of PS Plus subscribers) got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/">add <strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong> to their lineup</a>.</p>

<p>While it remains to be seen if any game launching this year, such as the highly anticipated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marvel's Wolverine</em></strong>, will take full advantage of the system's power, by March<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">,</strong> the system is reportedly getting a much-welcome upgrade that promises to deliver significant image quality and performance improvements, and a few surprises.</p>

The user revealed when the new version of the upscaler will launch, how it will improve the performance of certain games, and more, as summarized below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Update will be available between <strong>January and March</strong>.</li>



<li>Features similar to <strong><em>FSR 4</em></strong> will be implemented on <strong><em>PS5 Pro</em></strong>.</li>



<li>Improved image quality and performance.</li>



<li>Increased frame rates for games that previously sat at <strong>70-80 FPS</strong>.</li>



<li>Higher resolution for classic low-resolution games.</li>



<li>New debugging tools will also be available for developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Particularly interesting is also the fact that classic low-resolution games will run at higher resolutions, which could make classic games on the&nbsp;PlayStation Store&nbsp;and&nbsp;more expensive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Plus</em></strong> subscriptions more enticing.</p>
