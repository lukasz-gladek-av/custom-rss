			<p>As any PC gamer who played some Battlefield 6 during the recent beta test weekends will have already noticed, there is no trace of ray tracing options whatsoever in the graphics settings. That, alongside the complete absence of any mention from the developers, was already more than telling. However, just to be absolutely certain, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook.com</a> got the chance to ask Christian Buhl, who is the Studio Technical Director at Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA, the team working primarily on the Portal mode). Buhl confirmed that ray tracing was not considered and is probably not making it into the game in the near future, either.</p>



<p><em>No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either. That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as optimized as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, it does feel a bit of a downgrade when you consider that Battlefield V was one of the first PC games to support ray tracing back in 2018, specifically for the reflections. Three years later, the ill-fated Battlefield 2042 offered ray traced ambient occlusion. However, Buhl is definitely right that a competitive multiplayer shooter should focus first and foremost on performance.</p>



<p>Players have clearly appreciated that, turning the Battlefield 6 beta into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest ever registered for this franchise</a>. GeForce users can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further accelerate performance</a> with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. AMD users can enable FSR 3 with FSR Frame Generation, and Intel users can select Intel XeSS with XeSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10.</p>

			<p>Here's something I really wasn't expecting to write about: YouTuber and modder InfernoPlus has successfully ported The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine.</p>



<p>Originally, InfernoPlus had planned to port Morrowind to Dark Souls 1, then shifting to Dark Souls 3 and eventually to Elden Ring. Not only is FromSoftware's latest game a better title in every regard, including fidelity and gameplay, but its (entirely unofficial and user-made) modding tools have also greatly matured to the extent of making even such a gargantuan undertaking possible.</p>



<p>InfernoPlus said he has been working on the project for quite a while and is now roughly halfway done, but also admitted it's hard to say with any accuracy at this point. The modder said world generation is finished, and lighting and world effects are nearly there, although some lighting processing is still needed.</p>



<p>Interiors are also basically finished, while dialogue generation still must have its scripting data loaded. Voice acting will be added toward the end of the mod's development. However, NPCs, be they animals or humanoids, still have to be properly converted: right now, they're either Elden Ring's default girl (for humanoids) and goats (for animals).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the video, InfernoPlus also touches on the inevitable copyright question, stating that the project cannot possibly violate any laws, as it does not include any Morrowind data. It requires the user to have that Morrowind data installed with a legitimate copy of the game, similar to A Tale of Two Wastelands, which combines Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in a single game while requiring both games. This Morrowind port to the Elden Ring engine is also open source, by the way.</p>



<p>The modder then requested the community's help to keep going. InfernoPlus has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/infernoplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon page</a> where fans can support his work, but beyond that, the project could also use more expertise in certain areas. Between this and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skywind</a>, Morrowind fans have two total conversion mods to look forward to. There's also the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morro RTX mod</a> that aims to take the original game and significantly boost its visuals with the help of NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod is, however, still in its infancy.</p>
