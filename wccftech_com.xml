			<p>Free-to-play first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/">Delta Force</a> from developer Team Jade will arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles on <strong>August 19, 2025</strong>, the studio announced.</p>
<p>The news comes alongside the reveal of what Team Jade is calling the game's "<em>largest update yet,</em>" which will be available for players on PC and mobile platforms in a little less than two weeks' time, on&nbsp;<strong>July 9, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the new content coming on July 9, the Season Break update will bring new maps for Operations and Warfare, a new operator, swimming, improvements to Victory Unite, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="SEASON BREAK PREVIEW STREAM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlXOM1OyUHc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Operations map is called Tide Prison, a high-tech island prison that players have to infiltrate under the guise of being a new batch of prisoners, meaning you'll have to collect your gear after you're already inside. The new Warfare map is called Cyclone, a tropical island that's hiding an ICBM missile site.</p>
<p>Cyclone will feature infantry and vehicle combat, and adds a dynamic weather system to the gameplay to create even more intense chaos.</p>
<p>The new operator players can select is Tempest, who players can unlock for free along with the battle pass. Tempest is a movement-focused operator with an exoskeletal device that gives them greater mobility and is ideal for close-ranged encounters where she can easily close the gap between her and her unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p>Players looking to dive into Delta Force on consoles will be able to take advantage of all the content in the game up to its release this August, and will be able to play the Black Hawk Down single-player campaign as part of free DLC. If you're incredibly keen to play Delta Force on your PS5 or Xbox Series device, than you can wishlist the game starting tomorrow, June 28, so you'll be sent a reminder by your platform of choice that it's ready for you to hop into.</p>
