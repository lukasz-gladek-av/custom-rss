			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has started arriving in stores ahead of next week's launch, as confirmed by pictures making the rounds online.</p>
<p>One of the pictures, which can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pDdR1vP">here</a>, shows the front and back of the system's box, which provides information on the box's content and the system's basic features. Funnily enough, the 8K sticker that was found on the base model's launch box is nowhere to be seen, highlighting how that crazy high resolution is no longer considered a marketing point, even though the system is actually capable of running games at 8K resolution, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a>, unlike the base model.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you need to know more about the PlayStation 5 Pro box, Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20241029053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> posted a hilarious review of it, highlighting how the white hardware and text stand out against the seductive black color of the box and how it has a very PlayStation-like fragrance, and providing a comparison with boxes for previous generation consoles and the base PS5 models. Even with an automated translation, it is still a very entertaining read, so make sure to check it out if you need something to tide you over until the release of the system and the posting of proper reviews of the system.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>In a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">developer diary</a> for Titan Quest II, those who are excited about the game get to find out more about the Skills and Modifiers that will be available in the game. Players will be given a chance to combine any two masteries to create their own class to help them stand out from the ground and provide them with a unique class. When Early Access begins (which is slated for <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">Winter 2024</a>), players will have access to Earth, Storm, and Warfare masteries. As the game begins to be updated during the Early Access period, there will be more masteries available, providing new and returning players with the opportunity to mix up their class type further and create something new.</p>
<p>In the new Titan Quest II dev diary, players are given a preview into some of the skills that will be available, alongside the modifiers that can drastically change the game for the player. While some of the Modifiers available are passive tweaks that work in the background, some of them are active, and can turn an attack from a sweeping strike into a whirlwind attack, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, players will be able to equip a maximum of 10 skills to the ability bar, allowing for a varied playstyle. This means that you can have a primary damage type and have your other skills be defensive and supportive skills that can provide synergies to your damaging skills. Of course, as previously mentioned, there will be skill trees for players to explore, which helps players decide between active or passive skills and modifiers, which can help bring your character from zero to hero.</p>
<p>In the dev diary that is posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/4445708897933590548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog</a>, there are videos that show examples of how the different masteries work and how the modifiers interact with the different masteries. For example, there is a video that shows off Earth Mastery and how you can use modifiers to create a Lava Fissure skill that produces a line AoE on the floor, dealing strike damage to your enemy, as well as dealing fire damage. Of course, since the skill has been modified, it will cost extra energy. There are also further tweaks you can make, such as the Additional Fissures modifier which reduces your overall damage, but allows you to spawn in extra fissures to cover more ground.</p>

<p>There are plans to showcase more gameplay footage in the future, when more dev diaries are released for Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>Will you be getting this game in the Early Access period? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>The Halloween season has come back around, and players will be able to experience the Tower Raid once more, but with a Halloween twist. In Dying Light 2, players will be able to experience the Tower Raid: Halloween Run event, where there are new levels, weapons, rewards, and a very festive final boss fight for those who manage to climb to the top. For those who want to take part in the event, the Dying Light 2 Tower Raid: Halloween Run will last from October 30 to November 20. This event is available for players right after the prologue, meaning those who are new to the game will be able to get stuck in without having to sit through a ton of missions first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light 2: Stay Human — Tower Raid: Halloween Run" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC56Q9bG_yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The event offers plenty of new rewards, new candies, and the return of Baka, who will be waiting at the Bazaar, offering bounties for you to complete. To celebrate the release of Tower Raid: Halloween Run in Dying Light 2, a trailer has been released. This event will also feature new content for each week that it's available.</p>
<p>For the first week of the event in Dying Light 2, players will be able to get to grips with the new progression system that has been designed specifically for this event, as well as getting their hands on some of the rewards up for grabs. By the second week, players will be able to increase the difficulty level as Elite Mode makes a return to the event, as well as exclusive bounties to participate in. For the third week, you'll be able to unlock daily bounties, which will help contribute to getting your hands on rewards.</p>
<p>As this is a separate event version of Tower Raid, there will be eight floors in total to work through, with a themed boss at the top. Some of the floors are entirely new to the game, with all of them being decorated to fit in with the Halloween theme. To celebrate the festive season, there is also a brand new character system where players will be able to select a role from four options that are available. They each have unique loadouts and traits. The characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarecrow - Two-handed scythe wielder and increased HP pool</li>
<li>Plague - Increased melee damage and stamina with a Plague Cane that utilizes the buffs</li>
<li>Van Aiden - Crossbow and increased ranged damage</li>
<li>Cursed Pirate - Cutlass-wielder with parkour damage perks</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Halloween update, there is a new patch released for Dying Light 2, which adds a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life improvements, as well as new weapons for players to obtain. There will also be a new firearm control layout, which can be activated in the control system. It's been confirmed that there will be future updates to work on making this game a smoother, enhanced experience for the players.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who prefer to find out the patch notes and major updates added to a game via a video format, the development team has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA1Uq6aWyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying 2 Know More</a>, which talks about the Halloween event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/">future plans for the game</a>.</p>
