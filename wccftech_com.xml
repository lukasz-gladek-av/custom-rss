			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has released the latest monthly charts for US video game sales for October 2025, and the two games at the top of the charts are the two games you would have expected to be there: Battlefield 6 and Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Those were the top two games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> in first place and Pokémon Legends Z-A in second, though it's worth remembering that Nintendo doesn't share its digital sales data with any of the big analytics firms, Circana included, which means that on physical sales alone, it had a stronger month than 18 other games, some of them new releases, some of them sales-charts-topping regulars like EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26.</p>



<p>It also could mean that, were digital sales properly included, Pokémon Legends Z-A might have been listed as the actual best-selling premium game in the US for October 2025. But we can't know its digital sales, so that crown goes to Battlefield 6.</p>







<p>Number one on the sales charts for the month of October in the US isn't the only crown Battlefield 6 is walking away with, as it also launched right to the top of the list for best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>According to Piscatella, not only did Battlefield 6 become the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, it also "<em>produced the highest single month US physical and digital full game tracked dollar sales total in three years. The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October 2022</em>."</p>







<p>It's all coming up roses for Battlefield 6 on the commercial front, but it's one month away from perhaps the biggest victory it could hope for, which would be maintaining its top spot over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November 2025 sales numbers are in.</p>



<p>Of course, we'll have to wait a while for those numbers, but for now, Battlefield 6 can bask in its top spot for the month, for the year, and in the history of the franchise. Also, it's worth noting that while Battlefield 6 may be the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, when it comes to exclusively physical sales, the best-selling game in the US so far is Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Other notable elements of the list include <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">September 2025's best-selling game in the US</a> dropping all the way to the tenth best-selling game, with Borderlands 4 going from the top spot to halfway down the top-20 list.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was also able to squeeze into the top-10 in seventh place, just ahead of another new release, Little Nightmares III, which made the list in eighth place. Ninja Gaiden 4, another big new release for October 2025, made the top-20 list, but not the top-10, as it fell just outside the top-10 in eleventh place. </p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be the best-selling console, though what's more impressive is how far ahead it is compared to Nintendo Switch sales for the same time period of its launch year. "<em>It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4's previous record velocity</em>," writes Piscatella.</p>



<p>Another notable hardware tidbit is that spending on ASUS PC portable hardware saw a 4.8x spike led by he release of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. You can find out more about both devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">my interview with ASUS executives last month,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">in my review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, October 2025 was a strong month for video game sales in the US. It saw a 3% growth over October 2024, and included a couple of the year's best-selling games so far. However, the real bout of the year for US sales is currently happening right now, between Call of Duty and Battlefield, with both games officially out and available for players to buy. We'll see which game ends up at the top of the charts for November 2025.</p>
