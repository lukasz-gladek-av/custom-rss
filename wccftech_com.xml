			<p>While 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2024-gaming-delivers-another-solid-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a solid year</a> for new games released on the market, it couldn't possibly match the triple-A onslaught seen in 2023. The year that started a few weeks ago, however, has a release schedule packed with many big returning franchises, like Monster Hunter, DOOM, Mafia, Metal Gear Solid, and, of course, Grand Theft Auto. Sure, some of the games we've picked for our overall most anticipated list might be delayed to 2026, but then again, there's always a chance that other rumored titles will launch this year and fill in those holes. Based on what we know, there's a strong likelihood that 2025 will turn out nearly as memorable as 2023, if not more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Monster-Hunter-Wilds.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28)</h2>
<p>The first big game on the calendar is arguably CAPCOM's Monster Hunter Wilds. This one has a massive hype behind it, following the explosive successes of Monster Hunter World and Rise, which now occupy the first two places in CAPCOM's all-time sales charts with 20.9 and 16 million units sold, respectively. Monster Hunter Wilds got a tech upgrade to the RE Engine, while zones are larger and more seamless than in the previous two installments. Each of the weapon types has new moves, as you'd expect from a sequel, and there are some quality-of-life improvements as well. Both the main character and their Palico are now fully voiced. It won't be long until we find out if Monster Hunter Wilds is everything fans are hoping for; until then, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest hands-on preview</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DOOM-TheDarkAges_Standard_1920x1080-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages (May 15)</h2>
<p>id Software has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the third game in the reboot DOOM series, The Dark Ages, during the Xbox Developer Direct 2025. This one is a prequel meant to chronicle the origin story of the Slayer in a sci-fi/fantasy medieval setting. Whereas DOOM Eternal featured fast and acrobatic combat, The Dark Ages bets everything on a heavier, more grounded combat with an emphasis on the shield (which can block, throw, parry, and deflect). There will be other melee weapons like an iron flail and a spiked mace, but that doesn't mean there will be any shortage of guns.</p>
<p>The Texas-based developer is betting everything on the single player campaign, which will be the biggest they have ever made. It will feature large sandbox levels, plenty of secrets to unlock, and even some cool mini-games like taking control of a 30-story Atlan mech and a cybernetic dragon.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MSFT_Titled_Hero_Art_1920x1080-456e7caef43f07c5f569.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Mafia: The Old Country (Q2/Q3)</h2>
<p>Here's another prequel to a beloved saga. Hangar 13 is bringing Mafia fans back to Sicily to show the origins of the organized crime group. In the early 1900s, in the fictional city of Celeste, players will witness first-hand Enzo Favara's journey from a childhood of forced labor in the sulphur mines to joining the Torrisi crime family.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will be a linear, cinematic-driven title, unlike previous Mafia games. Combat will include period-authentic firearms and melee knife fights; similarly, getaways may take place on horseback or on turn-of-the-century automobiles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring: Nightreign (TBA)</h2>
<p>One of the biggest surprises from The Game Awards 2024 was that FromSoftware <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has another Elden Ring game scheduled for 2025</a>. However, this one feels a bit of a gamble for the award-winning Japanese studio. While Nightreign does support single player, it's really intended to be played online with other players. In a procedurally generated version of Limgrave, players must collaborate to survive three in-game days before facing a final boss. Taking a cue from the Battle Royale genre, the playable area shrinks, but players can reset it at the end of an in-game day if they defeat a boss.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Ghost of Yōtei (TBA - PlayStation 5)</h2>
<p>Sucker Punch Productions returns to its most successful franchise with the inevitable sequel to the fantastic open world action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. The Seattle-based studio has, however, made the bold choice to abandon its protagonist, Jin Sakai, in favor of Atsu (played by actress Erika Ishii), a female warrior who takes on the persona of "The Ghost". The story takes place 329 years after the events of the previous installment, on the island of Hokkaido, where the titular mount of Yōtei is located. We don't know a lot about the game, although Sucker Punch already revealed that players will have greater agency in shaping the narrative through Atsu's choices. Moreover, they are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">striving to make the open world feel less repetitive than Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (TBA - Nintendo Switch, Switch 2)</h2>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond might be one of the most problematic games Nintendo has recently produced. As fans will remember, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2017, only a few months after the release of the Nintendo Switch. Back then, the game was rumored to be in development at Bandai Namco Studios. However, after the game was missing in action throughout 2018, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in early 2019 that development had restarted from scratch at Retro Studios, the maker of the previous entries in Metroid Prime.</p>
<p>At last, the first-person action/adventure game is slated to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometime this year</a>. Details are quite scarce, though previous job openings suggest an increased cinematic focus. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also set to launch in 2025</a>, it's not hard to imagine Nintendo might want to leverage it as a launch title (albeit a cross-gen one) like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the first Switch.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GTA-VI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto VI (TBA)</h2>
<p>It's been twelve years since Grand Theft Auto V dropped on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Yes, the most successful gaming franchise (GTA V <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke 200 million units sold</a>, becoming the second best-selling game ever made after Minecraft) has skipped an entire console generation.</p>
<p>As a result, the hype surrounding Grand Theft Auto VI has reached incalculable heights. Rockstar Games is used to each game becoming its own phenomenon, and the perception is that GTA VI will be no different. The debut trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-200-million-views-in-7-months-on-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke YouTube records</a>, showing off the game's protagonist duo, lovers and partners Lucia and Jason. Fans are eagerly waiting to learn more ahead of the scheduled Fall 2025 release window, which could well be moved if need be. Other games slated around that time would certainly welcome a delay, as GTA VI may otherwise obliterate the competition this Fall.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Fable (TBA - PC, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Fable was once synonymous with the Xbox brand. While Peter Molyneux's dreamy vision about choices and consequences never fully materialized, the action role-playing franchise was still highly enjoyable, particularly thanks to its Albion fantasy setting filled to the brim with British humor.</p>
<p>However, the franchise seemed dead after&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-legends-officially-cancelled-lionhead-studios-closing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer Lionhead Studios closed</a>. Thankfully, after several years, whispers of a reboot in development at Forza Horizon studio Playground Games became stronger and stronger until Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed everything</a></span>. Nearly five years after that announcement, Fable is reportedly ready to launch, probably in the latter half of 2025. If that's truly the case, Playground must be preparing a proper unveiling for the gameplay.</p>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NG4-Key-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></h2>
<h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 (Fall 2025)</h2>
<p>The surprise addition to this list is Ninja Gaiden 4, which we knew absolutely nothing about until a few days ago when it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Developer Direct 2025. Team NINJA has partnered with PlatinumGames to create another entry in the revered action game franchise, and it's coming in late 2025.</p>
<p>Narrative-wise, Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place many years after Ninja Gaiden 3. The setting is a near-future Tokyo ruled by the evil Dark Dragon, a creature featured in some of the previous games. The developers have introduced a new protagonist, the young ninja Yakumo, but the beloved Ryu Hayabusa is returning as well as a playable character. While there are some differences between the respective movesets, some of the signature moves, like Izuna Drop and Flying Swallow, can be executed by both Yakumo and Ryu.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Metal-Gear-Solid-Delta-Snake-Eater.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (TBA)</h2>
<p>Last but not least, there's the return of Naked Snake, also known as Big Boss. Metal Gear Solid 3 is a masterpiece that largely remained confined to the PlayStation 2 (Nintendo DS port notwithstanding), and this remake aims to reimagine it with Unreal Engine 5-powered modern visuals and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several gameplay tweaks</a>. Arguably, the biggest change is the updated 'New Style' control scheme, which is based on modern action titles and Metal Gear Solid V. However, nostalgics can always enable the 'Legacy Style' to experience the same control scheme featured in the original. The Silent Hill 2 remake was a success, and KONAMI is hoping this one will be, too.</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake has reached an important sales milestone, publisher Konami confirmed today.</p>
<p>The remake of the second entry in the series developed by Bloober Team released back in October 2024 on PC and PlayStation 5 has now sold over 2 million units worldwide, counting both retail and digital sales. To mark the occasion, Konami shared a celebratory image to thank fans, which can be found below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/unnamed-5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The success the Silent Hill 2 remake is enjoying is completely justified. Bloober Team developed an excellent remake that faithfully reimagines the original without doing away with what makes the original one of the best survival-horror games ever released still to this day, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dino-crisis-1-and-2-are-now-available-on-pc-via-gog-complete-with-several-enhancements.1094646/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first two entries in the Dino Crisis are now available on PC via GOG, and they both come with several enhancements over the original releases.</p>
<p>Among the various enhancements included in the new releases of the two classic survival horror series developed by CAPCOM are full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, all localizations, Original, Arrange and Operation Wipe Out modes for the first game, Easy difficulty, Dino Colosseum and Dino Duel for the second, improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. The two games are available as <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">standalone</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchases</a> for $9.99 each or as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">bundle</a> costing $16.99.</p>
<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while and has only recently seen some attention from CAPCOM with the re-release of the first entry of the series on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-is-coming-to-the-playstation-plus-classics-library-new-banner-suggests/">PlayStation Store</a> for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. While series creator <a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shinji Mikami</a> believes the Japanese publisher won't bring back the series while the Monster Hunter franchise continues to be so successful, CAPCOM not only recently registered a new trademark, but is also showing how it is more than willing to bring back dormant franchises with the announcement of new entries in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a> series. Hopefully, the Japanese publisher will show Mikami-san that Dino Crisis and Monster Hunter can easily coexist in the future.</p>
