			<p>NVIDIA Game Ready version 566.36 driver is now available for download, introducing support for this month's biggest games, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>Besides featuring optimizations for the highly anticipated game developed by MachineGames, which launches in a few hours for owners of either the Premium Edition or the Collector's Edition, the new Game Ready driver brings support for Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-path-of-exile-2-to-the-list-premium-monthly-subscription-is-50-off-until-december-30/">Path of Exile 2</a>, as well as support for the next Forza Motorsport update, which introduces ray-traced global illumination, and for the next Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 update which brings NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS 3, both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Marvel Rivals will release with support for NVIDIA's tech which boosts performance considerably at all resolutions and on all RTX 4000 series GPU. In MachineGames' title, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 3 can double performance on an RTX 4090 at 4K resolution, Supreme preset, and ray tracing. In Marvel Rivals, using NVIDIA DLSS 3 can boost performance by 2.8 times on average at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080.</p>
