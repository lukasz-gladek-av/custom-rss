			<p>The <strong>next-gen Xbox console</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which we know will <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-developing-custom-chips-microsoft-power-next-gen-xbox-consoles-pcs-handhelds/">be powered by a <strong>semi-custom SoC</strong> currently in development from <strong>AMD</strong></a>, is "<em>progressing well to <strong>support a launch in</strong> <strong>2027</strong></em>," said AMD's chief executive officer, <strong>Dr. Lisa Siu</strong>, during the <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1276/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results">company's 2025 fourth quarter earnings call</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle," </em>Dr. Siu said on the call<em>. "From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year. And <strong>development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Dr. Siu's comment about the Steam Machine isn't anything new, as it only corroborates what <strong>Valve</strong> has said regarding the release of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">which have always had an <strong>"<em>early 2026</em>"</strong> release window</a>. It's her comments on the next-gen Xbox that are worth noting, which give credence to rumours we heard last year that also identified a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">2027 release window</a></strong> for the next-generation device. </p>



<p>Of course, her comment doesn't mean you should write 'next-gen Xbox release' in your 2027 calendar, because it will ultimately be Microsoft's call as to when the device launches. What her comments do mean is that if Microsoft is in fact ready to launch this next-gen device in 2027, then AMD is currently on track to support that launch.</p>



<p>Officially, we don't know a lot about this next-generation device. Microsoft and Xbox have hinted at what it will be like, with Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> hinting that the device will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>,"</a> while also adding that we can look to <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">how the <strong>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</strong> operates in a space between console and PC</a> as to what Microsoft is trying to build with this new hardware.</p>



<p>Everything else we know about the device comes from reports and rumours, some of them supported by official comments, like how Bond calling it a "<em>very high-end</em>" device supports the rumour that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">it'll cost somewhere in the range of <strong>$1,000</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Or how allusions from Bond and Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, about the device being a <strong>PC/console hybrid</strong> support rumours that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">Microsoft is testing how it would put <strong>Steam</strong> on this new device</a>, which is further <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-features-xbox-game-dev-kit-point-next-gen-xbox-pc-console-hybrid/">supported by features added to software updates for Xbox development kits</a>.</p>



<p>Other questions about the console, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-controller-with-dualsense-like-haptics-is-reportedly-still-on-the-way-for-next-gen/">features the controller will include</a>, whether it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-digital-next-gen-sony-nintendo/">be a <strong>fully digital device</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">if it'll have <strong>backwards compatibility</strong></a><strong>, </strong>remain bigger questions for now. But at least we know that AMD is ready for it to arrive next year. Hopefully, Microsoft will be ready to launch next year, too, and we can learn more about what the company's plans are for its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">as console sales continue to <strong>decline each quarter significantly</strong></a>. </p>
