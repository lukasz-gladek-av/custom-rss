			<p>The Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign is launching today to further expand the action role-playing game in development by The Farm 51 with new features, including a highly requested one.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, The Farm 51 listened to and analyzed fan feedback regarding the game, noticing how the switch from the first-person combat view of the first entry in the series to the new third-person perspective of the sequel was the most critical issue. As such, the studio decided to fix the issue by introducing a switchable third-person and first-person combat perspective, but to do so, it is asking fans for support. More information on the fundraising campaign can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg/">Kickstarter page.</a></p>
<p>To celebrate the beginning of the Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign, The Farm 51 also released a new gameplay trailer showcasing some of the game's most prominent features. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
