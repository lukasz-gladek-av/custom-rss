			<p>Today, Creative Assembly made the announcement that Total War: WARHAMMER III's newest DLC will be launching on December 12. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This DLC is named Omens of Destruction</a> and will include a ton of new content for players to get stuck into. This includes faction expansions, a new Legendary Lord, and much more. Now, let's dive into the nitty gritty about what you can expect from Total War: WARHAMMER III's DLC, Omens of Destruction.</p>
<p>Omens of Destruction focuses on expanding the factions of Khorne, Greenskins, and Ogre Kingdoms by adding new lords, heroes, and units. In addition, there will be new gameplay mechanics for players to utilize and master in Immortal Empires.</p>
<p>In addition to this content, as part of Patch 6.0 of Total War: WARHAMMER III, the 100th Legendary Lord will be added to the game as free content. This Legendary Lord is Arbaal the Undefeated, the champion of Khorne. As part of the patch, players will also see a faction update arrive in the game for the Ogre Kingdoms, Khorne, and Orcs &amp; Goblins.</p>

<p>Moving on to the paid DLC content, there are three significant updates to the factions being added. First is Skulltaker, the Hero Slayer, Khorne's immortal champion and the best of all Bloodletters. With the addition of Skulltaker comes a Cloak of Skulls, which is a campaign feature. Skulltaker is tasked with seeking out enemy lords and defeating them. They excel in dueling and hunting. Along with Khorne's new champion, there will be new units to experiment with. This includes two legendary heroes named Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Orcs &amp; Goblins, players will get to play as Gorbad Ironclaw, the Brutal Unifier. He is one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses. The campaign feature for Gorbad is named Da' Plan, where you have to experiment and try to utilize unique battle tactics for your armies. Compared to Skulltaker, his playstyle is rather different. He rides into battle on his Warboar named Gnarla. He is able to close the gap between him and his enemies by charging in and using his hefty axe in close combat.&nbsp; There are new units, including the legendary hero Sngla Grobspit, as well as warriors like the Savage Orc Great Shaman and Night Goblin Big Boss.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Golgfag Maneater, the Mercenary. They are one of the most successful Ogre mercenaries of all time. In their campaign feature, you have to take on mercenary contracts where you help out your clients across the expansive Warhammer World to help settle their disputes with enemies. When Golgfag is in battle, he uses a wide variety of barbaric weaponry to secure the kills. Of course, there are also new units for the Ogres, which includes the Legendary Hero Bragg the Gutsman, as well as the Ogre Paymaster and Bruiser.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the expansive iceberg, and there are plenty more units for you to explore and utilize on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the battlefield</a> in Total War: WARHAMMER III's upcoming DLC. You don't have long to wait, as it's set to release on December 12. Make sure to check out the trailer above to see some of the content in action.</p>
