			<p>The next game in the BioShock series, which is currently referred to as BioShock 4, is reportedly having some major problems in development, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA3NDMxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0Njc5MTE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEJXRTJHUTFZV1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Zt4Beo52NA1y9AxmXB4Bd38T64ITJqEG1fTMqnDAfZU">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> reports that it recently failed a check-in review with Take-Two and 2K leadership, which resulted in major changes being ordered to the game's narrative, and two of developer Cloud Chamber's creative leadership being removed from their roles into other areas of the company.</p>



<p>The report also reveals that a remake of the first BioShock game was in the works before it was "<em>shelved</em>" earlier this year, according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>







<p>Kelley Gilmore, studio head at Cloud Chamber, was removed from her role as studio head and moved into a position on the publishing side of things, as a result of BioShock 4 failing its recent review, and Hogarth de la Plante, creative director at Cloud Chamber, suffered the same fate, and is now in a publishing role. </p>



<p>2K reportedly told Cloud Chamber's staff that they need to be "<em>more agile and efficient,"</em> which Schreier adds now has staff concerned that layoffs are around the corner.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to Bloomberg in response to questions sent in regarding this report, 2K Games said, "<em>We are working hard to set </em><em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future. <em>Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path</em>." The same spokesperson also confirmed the role changes for Gilmore and de la Plante.</p>



<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been in development <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">in some form or another since 2015</a>, or should we say at least since then, as Schreier adds that the game has been in development for "<em>more than a decade</em>," referring to his prior reporting that Certain Affinity had been working on the next BioShock game since at least 2015.</p>



<p>We only (<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-new-game-top-secret-2k-studio/">officially</a>) learned that BioShock 4 was coming in 2019, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/">Cloud Chamber announced as the studio helming the project</a>. In 2023, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/">claims that the game had been internally rebooted for a second time</a>, after suffering a reboot in 2018. Last year, we saw Cloud Chamber looking to ramp up development with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/">multiple job listings posted</a>, and that was essentially the most recent sign of life we've seen from the studio on BioShock 4.</p>



<p>The lack of any concrete information on the game for more than a decade is as good a sign as any that it's struggling in development, because surely if it were anywhere near release, 2K and Take-Two would have already been shouting about it from rooftops. But today's report shows that Take-Two aren't convinced that BioShock 4 is where it needs to be yet.</p>



<p>Of course, there's a stark difference between what a great game looks like for bean-counting executives versus the developers actually working on it. There's more than a slight chance that this failure could be the result of Take-Two just not believing that the current path for BioShock 4 won't be the one that sells the most copies. That doesn't mean it isn't a great game in its current state.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's clear we'll have to continue waiting to see what happens with the next BioShock game. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II developers and creators, Tarsier Studios, have showcased more of their next project, REANIMAL, which we now know will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 sometime during Q1 2026.</p>



<p>Announced last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/">Gamescom 2024</a>, this new release window is a bit of a delay from the studio's previous target, as it was initially meant to arrive sometime in 2025. </p>



<p>While Tarsier has moved on from the Little Nightmares brand, a quick look at REANIMAL makes it clear that the studio is still playing in an adjacent sandbox with the look of this new horror adventure centered around two kids. This time however, they're constantly in a boat, having to navigate dark waters and the terrors that could be lurking in below them, as well as in front of them. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REANIMAL | What Happens After The Flood? | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMAxY69lfMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Interestingly, this new trailer also shows some more engaging gameplay than what we had in the first two Little Nightmares games, with a quick shot of some melee combat on top of the regular stealth gameplay that fans of Tarsier Studios have come to expect.</p>



<p>And even though Tarsier isn't straying too far from its Little Nightmares foundations, REANIMAL already looks like the studio is expanding beyond what the Little Nightmares brand could have allowed them to do, and like it has the potential to be their most exciting project yet.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have a more specific release date to look forward to soon.</p>
