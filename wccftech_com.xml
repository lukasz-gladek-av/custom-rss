			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the action role-playing set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe, will launch in late March on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The latest cinematic trailer, shown during today's The Game Awards Show 2024, confirmed that the game will be released on March 27th, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. In addition, a playable demo will be released in a little over a month, on January 16th, to allow players to get a taste of the experience before release.</p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will be an action role-playing game that will be worth the time of those looking for a challenging experience with some similarities with the Souls series. In the past few months, I had the opportunity to try out the game, and I was thoroughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">impressed</a> by it, especially by its combat mechanics, so much so that it has become one of my most anticipated games launching in 2025.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>

			<p>Today, a new entry in the Onimusha series, Onimusha: Way of the Sword, was announced for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first new entry in the series in a very long time was revealed today with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0auCmtj2K6g&amp;t=1s">intense trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards show which showed how the game will retain the unique atmosphere of the first few entries in the series but feature vastly different gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha Way of the sword  Trailer 4K - THE GAME AWARDS 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0auCmtj2K6g?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Onimusha: Warlords, a remaster of the first entry in the series, did not exactly set the world on fire, the announcement of Onimusha: Way of the Sword comes as an almost complete surprise. In case you haven't played the remaster, you can learn more about this remaster in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Warlords is a game from another era and the remaster, despite its many enhancements, sadly highlights how the experience hasn't aged too well. This doesn't mean that the game isn't good, as many of its ideas, such as combat, leveling system and puzzles, only required a few small tweaks to be truly excellent. The fact that it's a game from 2001 is clear when playing the game, but Onimusha: Warlords can still provide a sweet, albeit short, experience.</em></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Saber Interactive announced Turok: Origins, an upcoming co-op game based on the classic IP. In this title, players will become Turok warriors to face off against ferocious dinosaurs and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all humanity. However, they'll be powerful enough to take them on with devastating attacks powered by weapons and abilities. They may also harness fallen enemies' DNA to upgrade their arsenal.</p>
<p>In Turok: Origins, players will join the fight either alone or as a team against a variety of dinosaurs, creatures, and bosses that take to the ground, sky, swamps, and caves to push their skills to the limit. Engage in intense combat, where players must use everything at their disposal to ensure success, including melee attacks, special abilities, and fine-tuned weapons. Throughout the game, they'll unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry to dominate battles and neutralize foes. Plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more are all at disposal.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it will be possible to extract DNA from fallen enemies and the environment to unlock game-changing powers that evolve the Turoks' suit in real-time. Each DNA power not only enhances the character's look but also offers upgradable skills and abilities to give the players an edge in combat.</p>
<p>In the game's missions, players journey across deadly worlds on various planets. From ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles, each location is said to hold pieces of an unforgettable story packed with twists and turns.</p>

Up until this point, there has been a very minimal amount of detail given to Borderlands fans, other than the initial announcement that the game is indeed happening. The game doesn't have a release date yet, and the teaser for the game was only a couple of seconds long. Tonight, those interested in the beloved franchise will get to see a trailer never-before-seen, set to preview at<a href="https://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Game Awards</a>, which you will be able to see below.</p>

<p>This trailer is precisely what the Borderlands fans needed, as it fills in a little bit more of the details, as the eagerly awaiting fans only had access to a couple of pictures of concept art of the environments, which was showcased at PAX West, where the developers set down to talk about the game in the Gearbox Main Theater. The conversation was filmed and<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238145538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> uploaded on Twitch</a>, which is still available for you to watch now.</p>
<p>At the moment, the release date still isn't known, but the game is set to be released in 2025. The trailer was announced by the Founder of Gearbox Software, Randy Pitchford. The game is available to be wishlisted on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This game includes new Vault Hunters for you to play as, with many different weapons to choose from and utilize as you get to explore a brand-new planet that a terrifying leader is ruling. Compared to the other games in the franchise, Borderlands 4 is set to have the most expansive and diverse Vault Hunter skill tree out of all of the released games and gives players the most options for customization with their builds.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 will include new traversal mechanics, which will allow you to get types of loot in every nook and cranny, with the option to summon a vehicle on almost any part of the terrain to be able to travel the planet named Kairos.</p>
<p>Like previous games, Borderlands 4 will allow you to fight solo or in co-op, depending on what your preference is. If you choose to go with co-op, you'll be able to play with up to three other people.</p>
