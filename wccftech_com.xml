			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

			<p>Supermassive Games released a statement in which it confirmed that the studio has laid off 36 people, cuts that it says were made for the studio to "<em>adapt our team structure to better align</em>" with the changes and challenges of the video game industry. The studio also confirmed that Directive 8020, which was due to launch this October, has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>The statement was published to the<a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211"> studio's official X account</a>, where it writes "<em>This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected</em>."</p>



<p>Directive 8020, which was announced last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">Gamescom 2024</a>, and was supposed to be out this coming October 2, 2025, will now release sometime in "<em>the first half of 2026</em>." Supermassive adds "<em>the response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Directive 8020 wasn't the only game Supermassive had launching in October of this year though, with the other being <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a>, which is due out on October 10, 2025, and only gets a short mention at the end of the statement, where Supermassive claims that these layoffs have "<em>no impact on the development of Little Nightmares III</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/">February 2024</a>, Supermassive Games laid off a third of its staff, once again citing challenges in the changing video game industry. </p>

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online a few days back makes the experience more immersive than ever before, introducing some choice improvements to main character V's behavior.</p>



<p>As the name implies, the More Responsive V mod, now available for download for free from Nexus Mod, makes the game's main character react more dynamically to the world. With the mod, V will respond vocally to being bumped, hit by vehicles, and in a lot of other scenarios where a voiced reaction is expected, such as stealing vehicles, MaxTac's arrival, and more. With the mod, which uses unused voice lines that seem to have been created specifically for similar scenarios, V will also respond to Johnny Silverhand's comments while driving in a vehicle. You can check out the mod in action by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyNvkZuaNE">video</a>.</p>



<p>Despite having been released almost five years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 is still receiving plenty of love from CD Projekt Red and modders alike. A new 2.3 patch went live <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">last week</a>, introducing new content and features on all platforms, such as AMD FSR 4, FSR 3.1 Frame Generation support on PC and proper VRR support on consoles. The introduction of VRR support, according to Digital Foundry, is the closest we will get to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vrr-support-closest-to-official-ps5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patch.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-show-gets-the-benefit-of-having-the-same-production-team-the-fallout-tv-show-has.1249725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's Fallout TV show was praised for a number of things, one of them being how well the creative team behind the show was able to recreate the world of Fallout for the small screen. Beyond the performances and the characters, it was a huge boon to see how much everything looked and felt like it was right out of the game, and thanks to some eagle-eyed fans, we know that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/">Mass Effect</a> show could look just as good. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Eurogamer</a>, writer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey,</a> who is penning the scripts for the Mass Effect adaptation and operating as an executive producer on the show, shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">last November in an Instagram post</a>, that the majority of the production team behind Fallout, will be working with him on Mass Effect. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon</em>," Casey wrote. "<em>We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year). We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as Fallout including the fantastic Scott Farris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special</em>."</p>



<p>This doesn't ensure that the Mass Effect TV show will have the entire right look and feel, or that the characters will be stellar, or that the show will be a hit overall, but it does give the show a big leg-up. Mass Effect and Fallout are similar in that they both exist within expansive worlds, where multiply stories can be told without ever treading on the same ground the game's have already walked on. </p>



<p>It's a boon to see that many of the same people who understood the asssignment in adapting Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect. Hopefully, we'll learn more about the series soon.</p>
