			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilitiesâ€”a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>

			<p>Hideo Kojima is disappointed in the current state of the video game industry, as there are too many games that look and play the same.</p>



<p>Speaking with Ssense, the legendary game creator commented on the current state of the video game industry following this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, noting how almost every game shown involved fighting either aliens or medieval monsters. It's not just the premise that seems to be almost identical, as Hideo Kojima finds that even visuals and gameplay systems are pretty much the same. While he understands that many people enjoy these games, he believes that it is important to put something really new for the industry, which is something that the legendary game creator has consistently been doing for years, especially with the release of the two Death Stranding games, and only indies seem to be doing nowadays. Being disappointed in a game industry that is putting out games that look and play almost the same, it's not surprising that Hideo Kojima is not going to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the series, which will not change the original's gameplay significantly.</p>



<p>Although Hideo Kojima's games often manage to set themselves apart from almost every other game out there, the legendary game creator hasn't been exempt from criticism, especially for its extreme involvment in many aspects of game development. However, he believes that it is this singular concentrated vision the reason of his success, as it allows him to work on multiple aspects of a game simultaneously, unlike a movie where the process proceeds step by step, starting with writing the script then moving on to storyboarding and production.</p>



<p>With Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now out, Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions studio are working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">Physint</a>, which will mark his return to Metal Gear Solid's action/stealth formula, and the mysterious&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a>, which will be something totally different that people will either love or hate. Once the game is out, Kojima-san will listen to people's opinions, but reception won't matter, as he is sure the legacy of his games will be defined in the future.</p>
