			<p>The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and other global economic powers are having a significant impact on the production costs of various devices, including gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, which are primarily assembled in China. With the very concrete risk that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/two-of-the-biggest-dram-suppliers-are-skeptical-about-increasing-production/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the current massive price increases for components like RAM</strong></a> may cause console prices to increase further, Microsoft is taking a significant step to mitigate these risks by expanding production in Vietnam.</p>



<p>The evidence for this crucial production shift comes directly from regulatory documents. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-subsidiary-plans-expand-production-vietnam-document-shows-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Reuters</strong></a>, Foxconn subsidiary Fushan Technology is seeking permission to expand production in Vietnam to produce up to<strong> 4.8 million Xbox gaming devices annuall</strong>y. This likely includes not only consoles, but also accessories like controllers and headsets, which all carry the same price increase risk as consoles.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn't the only one, reportedly. In a related document, it's revealed that China's Luxshare-ICT is planning to produce up to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4.5 million game consoles per year</strong> at a factory in Vietnam, starting from 2026. The brands of the devices haven't been confirmed, so it could be any of the three big manufacturers, as all are facing the same global trade challenges that have led to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">an unprecedented price increase of gaming systems, years after their debut.</a></strong></p>



<p>Amidst price increases for all components due to trade tensions that show no signs of easing and the increasing demand for AI data centers, mitigating the risk of price increases for gaming devices in any possible way is the most sensible thing to do for all manufacturers, not just Microsoft for its Xbox devices. </p>



<p>With the<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/"> <strong>next console generation looming ahead</strong></a>, expanding production outside of China may also prevent gaming systems from reaching exorbitant prices, which would take away one of the advantages gaming consoles have over gaming PCs, including those targeting the same audience, such as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>:</strong> affordability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has released the Fallout 76: Burning Springs update across all platforms. The patch updates the game to version 1.7.22.12, with download sizes of roughly 28.8 GB on Steam, 39.3 GB on Microsoft Store, 41.9 GB on Xbox, and 40.8 GB on PlayStation.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously covered</a>, it's a major free expansion for the online survival action game Fallout 76 that opens a new Ohio‑set region west of Point Pleasant, introduces the Ghoul from the award-winning Amazon Prime Video TV show as a recurring character, and adds a full bounty‑hunting system plus new public events and creatures.</p>



<p>According to the developers, Fallout 76: Burning Springs is one of the largest map expansions released since the game's launch in 2018, probably the biggest since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020's Wastelanders</a>. It is accessed by crossing the Point Pleasant bridge into a rust‑scarred, war‑torn area of rural Ohio, which was never previously featured in any Fallout game. The region includes new wildlife and fishing content, including creatures like the Radhog that can be adopted as a C.A.M.P. pet, plus new fish species and at least one “local legend” catch.</p>



<p>The update adds a new questline that begins when level 30+ players tune into the Ohio Distress Signal; this story centers on Highway Town, its Last Resort saloon hub, and the ruthless Rust King, setting up a multi‑update narrative arc that will keep players engaged for some time. The patch also adds two new public events (Gearin’ Up and Sinkhole Solutions); both are located in the Burning Springs region and are built around the new enemy groups and environmental hazards there.</p>



<p>The patch applies a broad pass to weapon balance, legendary mods (including some new ones), and certain enemy behaviors. C.A.M.P. budgets have also been loosened, as several decorative and functional items receive lower budget costs.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Arguably, the highlight of Fallout 76: Burning Springs is the new Bounty Hunting feature, which lets players pick up basic Grunt Hunt and harder Head Hunt contracts in the Last Resort. Grunt Hunts target 1‑star Legendary enemies that can scale up to 2‑ and 3‑star as the player successfully completes more hunts, making them a structured Legendary farming path. Head Hunts, on the other hand, put the player on the trail of named targets tracked through the Challenges tab, with unique cosmetic and item rewards tied to specific bounties. Bounty Hunting is essentially a major new progression pillar, designed to be revisited for long‑term gear chasing.</p>



<p>The hook is that the quest giver is none other than The Ghoul, the popular character played by actor Walton Goggins in the TV series, who did all the voice work for the digital version as well. In the game, The Ghoul is overwhelmed by these bounty contracts and asks the player to step in and help clear them as they appear. Fallout 76: Burning Springs is neatly timed to release just ahead of the highly anticipated second season of the Prime Video show (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due on December 17</a>), where Lucy and The Ghoul pursue Lucy's father into New Vegas.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milepost Zero</a> is closing down in the Skyline Valley region. The rewards that were previously available when protecting Milepost Zero caravans are now spread across the Wasteland. The developers reckon that Bounty Hunting delivers the same promise of on-demand content with legendary enemies and great rewards more succinctly and satisfyingly. They also teased 'exciting plans' for the Skyline Valley region.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fallout 76: Burning Springs lands right alongside the launch of Season 23, Blood x Rust, featuring a new scoreboard themed around raiders, scrapyards, and Deathclaws. The board is packed with Raider themed C.A.M.P. items, workbenches, and décor, such as “raiderized” workstations, metal braziers, junk‑metal fences, and scrap‑themed prefabs, aimed at giving camps a freshly pillaged look. Multiple cosmetics and utility items reference the new Burning Springs content, including bounty‑hunter icons, Rust‑themed player titles, and props tied to the Ohio region’s Dino Golf attraction.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention Lands on December 11, Bringing ‘Evolved Monsters’ and Many More Changes]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GRZOQEKCPXRQ1764270043784-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>
