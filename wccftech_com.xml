			<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">announced</a> that it has reached a tentative deal with video game companies over the Interactive Media contract, potentially bringing the voice actors' strike to an end.</p>
<p>Performers under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">on strike since July 2024</a>, with the main sticking point being protections from companies abusing generative AI technology to use an actor's voice in perpetuity, without having to compensate them after the first contract agreement, or get consent from the actor to use an AI-generated version of their voice for future projects.</p>
<p>Now, a tentative deal has been reached, which SAG-AFTRA's national chief executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, says "<em>puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.</em>"</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added, "<em>Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game.</em>"</p>
<p>Once the details of the deal have been finalized, which is expected to happen "<em>soon</em>," the strike will end<em>. </em>Performers under the IMA are still on strike until such time.</p>

			<p>Funcom's large-scale multiplayer survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/">Dune: Awakening</a> is now out for all players after its strong head-start weekend, with a new gameplay trailer debuted to mark the event.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has already had a great start to its launch, with more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">117K players at once jumping in for the head start weekend,</a> which was only available to those who had pre-ordered the game's deluxe edition. Anyone who just bought the base game is free to head to Arrakis now, but it's a credit to Funcom that the game is already hitting high concurrent numbers like that with just deluxe edition owners.</p>
<p>While Dune: Awakening is out for players on PC today, it isn't out for those looking to head to Arrakis on consoles. We've known for a while now that the game would be coming to PC first, but it looks like players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will have to wait until next year to play Dune: Awakening.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's launch, Funcom confirmed that the game will be out on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S "<em>sometime in 2026</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also debuted a new trailer for the full launch, which is a massive cut of previous trailers smashed together for the game's full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Your Path to Awakening" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOGwZO_i-6o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just yesterday, ahead of today's launch, Funcom's chief executive and technical officer, Rui Casais, delivered a message to players, thanking those who had already jumped in for play, and their patience, as Funcom does its best to respond to any issues that come up in the course of the game's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Believe it or not, we do look at all your feedback across social media, Discord, support tickets, and Steam reviews. And we're working around the clock to mitigate any issues you find and improve the overall experience,</em>" Casais said in his video to players.</p>
<p>He also addressed players who have expressed issues with long queue times, saying that more servers will be added for today's full launch, and that Funcom is working to make sure player distribution between servers is evenly balanced. "<em>Worry not, there is enough capacity for all of you,</em>" Casais said.</p>
<p>And though Casais expressed confidence that Funcom is on top of everything with the launch of its latest big online multiplayer game, that didn't stop him from asking players to have some patience with the studio in these early days.</p>
<p>"<em>Funcom has been making online worlds like this for 25 years, and I have been personally doing it for soon 24, and I can tell you this is my most exciting launch so far. I can't wait to see more of you enjoying the game, and would ask you to please bear with us, if not everything is silky smooth when we open the game tomorrow. This is only the beginning. We have years' worth of plans for Dune: Awakening, and I want to once again thank you all for joining us on this journey.</em>"</p>

<p>Now that the game is out, players can also pick up the Season Pass, which includes the Wildlife of Arrakis DLC, which includes "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">four in-game statues celebrating some of the planet’s most tenacious creatures: the sandworm, chiroptera, kulon, and Muad’Dib.</span></em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">" The three other DLCs included in the Season Pass are expected to launch in Q4 2025, Q1 2026, and Q2 2026, with Funcom also releasing free content updates between the paid DLCs.</span></p>
