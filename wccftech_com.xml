			<p>While many didn't know what was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-new-project-state-of-play/">in store</a> for the State of Play, some had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/">some guesses</a> as to what may be announced, with Lies of P's DLC being at the forefront. Unfortunately, Bloodborne remastered wasn't announced, despite many feeling it was confirmed with the DMCA takedowns of the 60fps mod and the Bloodborne Demake. However, we do have the next best thing, which is new Lies of P content. Showcased during today's State of Play, the Lies of P DLC was announced, with the title Overture. You can check out the trailer for Lies of P Overture down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lies of P fans knew it was coming, as the DLC was announced shortly after the release of the game, which received positive reviews on all platforms. It's been nearly two years since the base game originally launched, and now we get to see Pinocchio come back, looking more fashionable than ever.</p>
<p>The DLC will take players back to the beginning of the Puppet Frenzy, the event that led to the destruction of Krat, which you experience in the base game. Players will then get to go on a journey through time to piece together the story of the past, present, and future of Lies of P, while being introduced to new locations and getting to experience new, thrilling boss fights.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features of Lies of P was the wide variety of costumes and weapons you could experiment with, combining the typical "fashion souls" experience with combat that was suited to your playstyle. With Lies of P Overture, players will get to experiment with more new outfits, and more new weapons. The DLC will allow players to craft new weapons and experiment with a new combat style, as well as try out new Legion Arms.</p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have a set release date just yet, but it has been confirmed by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers</a> that the Lies of P prequel DLC will be making its way onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro this summer. Whether this means it's tied exclusively to those consoles for a certain amount of time or whether the DLC will be released on console and PC remains to be seen. However, considering there was no mention of PC or even Xbox at this point, it does provide a little bit of anxiety that Lies of P fans won't be able to experience it at the same time as PlayStation users.</p>

			<p>One of the most impressive games we saw at Gamescom 2024 was Tides of Annihilation. We haven't been able to talk about it until now, but the long embargo is finally over as the project was just revealed during the latest State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and developed by Chengdu-based studio Eclipse Glow Games, this is a single player narrative-driven action/adventure game originally codenamed Ghosts of Fog. The setting features modern-day London mixed with many fantasy elements, some of which are explicitly borrowed from the Arthurian and Knights of the Round Table myths.</p>

<p>The main character is Gwendolyn, seemingly the only human survivor roaming in a post-apocalyptic London, who embarks on a journey to reclaim her legacy and her homeland. Eventually, she gains the ability to summon two Knights of the Round Table to fight at her side. In the footage, the combat&nbsp;looked fast, frantic, and meaty. The developers promised that the skills would be customizable, too.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation clearly takes some cues from games like Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus, as there are some gigantic bosses that are practically like their own level. Gwendolyn can climb on and explore them. Level design as a whole is inspired by the Metroidvania genre, featuring interconnected levels and shortcuts to unlock between them. London itself is also meant to be a character of sorts in the game. The developers likened it to a tree, with each branch being an iconic landmark, albeit transformed.</p>
<p>The team had around 100 developers during Gamescom 2024, although it planned to increase the size to 130 by the end of 2024 as Tides of Annihilation approached its beta phase. The employees have several years of experience at triple-A studios like Sega, Ubisoft, and Gameloft. For example, the game's producer designed combat in Yakuza 0, while the lead programmer worked on technologies used in Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia games.</p>

<p>The team also clarified that, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Eclipse Glow Games has received an investment from Tencent but is not owned by Tencent. Moreover, they already have plans to expand the IP to other mythologies, such as Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese, if it is as successful as they hope.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation is currently in development for PC and consoles, with no publicly announced release window.

			<p>Housemarque Games, the studio behind some of the best shooter games released in the past few years, announced today their next project called Saros.</p>
<p>The new game, which was announced during today's State of Play with a cinematic trailer and will launch sometime next year, is being built on the features of the studio's latest game, Returnal, to offer the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque trademark gameplay where every death will reshape the world while offering new upgrades to the player. Judging from the game's description and what happens in the trailer, there's little doubt that the game will feature some roguelike mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque's gameplay-first experience.</em></p>
<p>Saros is currently in development for PlayStation 5, and will release sometime next year. You can learn more about Returnal, the game upon which Housemarque is building their next title, in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>
