			<p>In between the other big announcements during today's State of Play presentation, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">release date and gameplay reveal for Saros</a> and our <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">first proper debut of Marvel's Wolverine</a>, PlayStation took some time to announce the PS Plus Essential games for October, headlined by Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2. We also learned that The Last of Us Part II will be joining the PS Plus Extra game catalog this coming Friday, September 26, 2025, to arrive in time for The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 will join the service for PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers on October 7, 2025, and joining alongside it will be the indie puzzle game hit Cocoon, and the physics-based comedy game Goat Simulator 3. Their arrival on October 7 also means that you have until October 6, 2025, to add Psychonauts 2, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder to your library, if you haven't already, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2025-psychonauts-2/">since those are the three games available to subscribers for September 2025</a>.</p>

<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers, The Last of Us Part 2 is just one of the games getting added to the service for October, with the rest of them surely getting announced within the coming weeks. We just got the news about The Last of Us Part 2 now because of today's State of Play presentation and its proximity to The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some of the games joining the Classics Catalog, which is exclusively for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers. Two of the titles are classic fighting games, Tekken 3 and Soulcalibur 3, which were marked as "<em>coming soon</em>" to the service.</p>



<p>The third game announced was the Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary, which was also marked as "<em>coming soon</em>," and could imply that these three titles aren't necessarily what will be added to the Classic's Catalog for subscribers in October. We'll see what the full announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium games for October reveals when it arrives in a few weeks time.</p>
