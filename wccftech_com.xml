			<p>Independent developer VOID Interactive announced the console launch date for its tactical first-person shooter game Ready or Not. The game will debut on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>&nbsp;and Xbox Series S|X on July 15 in three editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game</li>
<li>Day One Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>

</ul>
<p>The Dark Waters DLC and Home Invasion DLC are also available for separate purchase at $9.99 / £7.99 / €9.99 each.</p>
<p>Chris Stone, Studio General Manager at VOID Interactive, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a major milestone for everyone involved in the development of Ready or Not, from our initial development phase, to early access days, through to PC 1.0 and now consoles. Our amazing community has played a pivotal role in helping us shape this next chapter for Ready or Not and we wouldn’t be here without their valued feedback at all stages of development. We can’t wait to welcome our brand new console audience to Los Suenos and to share in their excitement this summer.</em></p>
<p>The console versions come with 18 single player or co-op missions (up to five players) and 2 new missions as part of the Los Sueños Stories free DLC update that will be released for free on PC on the same day. The Dark Waters and Home Invasion DLC bring 6 additional levels, and in Dark Waters DLC, there's also the UH-60 support Helicopter.</p>

<p>The game was in early access on PC for several years. It finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> its full launch in December 2023. As of last month, Ready or Not had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over nine million units to date. Needless to say, VOID Interactive is looking to break that ten million milestone with the help of console gamers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of our series of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviews</a> on the new Nintendo Switch 2 console (which we just reviewed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, by the way), we've got a new developer Q&amp;A with Koei Tecmo about their upcoming game WILD HEARTS S.</p>
<p>This is a new version of Wild Hearts, the monster hunting game that Koei Tecmo's Omega Force studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in February 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. One of the main changes compared to the previous version is that the maximum player count for cooperative gameplay has been increased from three to four players. We interviewed Producer Takuto Edagawa to learn more about this version, including the studio's first thoughts on the Nintendo Switch 2 console, which they believe to be closer to the Xbox Series S than the PlayStation 4 in overall power.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is now available to pre-order both digitally and physically ahead of the planned launch date of July 25. The game will feature voices in Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, with texts in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: 4 Player Co-op Gameplay with Developer Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRpRwb2s-jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for asking, but I am unable to provide specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough! How long has WILD HEARTS S been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose how long it has been in development, I think that since we have built up experience with the Switch development environment, despite this being a brand new hardware launch, I think it was a pretty developer-friendly environment.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>I'd have to go with the chat feature. It's become standard practice for hardcore gamers to use tools such as Discord to communicate while they play, but having this feature incorporated into the console allows more players to enjoy it as well. It might sound exaggerated, but I think this might have an impact on gaming culture as a whole.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is a hunting game where multiplayer is really fun, and now with the increase from three to four players in multiplayer, it's even more important to coordinate with others, so I hope everyone will use the game chat feature to communicate with their friends and enjoy hunting together.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power so it's difficult to generalize, but I think it can be thought as closer to the Series S.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for your game? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We're not using it for this game.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Since it's before the game's launch, right now we're refraining from talking about the resolution and frame rate.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Hearts was originally only available for the new consoles. What were the challenges you faced when porting this game to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware?</strong></p>
<p>We were able to handle the graphics quality and performance adjustments within the scope we had imagined. Especially in portable mode, the high quality LCD makes the graphics look smoother and more precise than the actual specs, which helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, even though this isn't particular to the Switch 2's processing power, we struggled with the processing in increasing multiplayer from 3 to 4 players. For the WILD HEARTS characters, we were very particular with the character creation feature and it is very robust, so adding an additional character was a huge challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are using HD Rumble. It allowed us to implement more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments, so I feel that it is more powerful than the Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>In WILD HEARTS S, players can use gimmicks known as 'karakuri' that can be instantly created on the field for a more innovative hunting experience. I would love to see many players enjoying the game, and I think of it as a step towards our next titles, so please invite your friends and happy hunting!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-gets-30-minute-gameplay-walkthrough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> the release date for Dying Light: The Beast, Techland also shared a large 30-minute gameplay walkthrough for the upcoming game. You can watch it below.</p>
<p>In this mission, protagonist Kyle Crane (who returns from the original Dying Light - check our interview with voice actor Roger Craig Smith <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is investigating an old chemical factory south of the city, operated by a group known as the Baron’s men. This factory is the base for sinister experiments on Chimeras, mutated zombie creatures crucial to the game's plot.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast stresses smart survival: simply put, not every encounter should be met with direct combat. For example, large groups of zombies known as Biters are best handled with distraction tactics like using decoys instead of fighting head-on.</p>
<p>In the mission seen in this Dying Light: The Beast gameplay walkthrough, Kyle, aided by a character named Olivia, follows clues leading to the abandoned factory. Here, he also faces the Virals, a faster type of zombie who is especially dangerous because they still maintain some human-like intelligence and behaviors. As in previous franchise entries, with dusk approaching, the impending night signals a dramatic increase in danger, ramping up the game's tension even further.</p>
<p>Abandoned buildings like the factory serve dual purposes: they are both potential traps and sources of valuable resources such as crafting materials and weapons. Attention to detail and careful exploration are vital for survival, with players encouraged to scour for hidden loot while constantly assessing the environment for threats. On that note, a&nbsp;new mechanic called Survivor Sense helps players identify enemies’ locations and types.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast also introduces a dynamic weather system, which adds realism and variety to the environments of Castor Woods but can pose additional challenges for the player. The game world is varied and includes multiple biomes such as swamps, national parks, and industrial zones, each with distinct visuals and gameplay dynamics. Furthermore, the open world will feel more dynamic thanks to raider activity outside the safe zones, producing emergent gameplay moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Full 30 Minute Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZXdLBVg1Qk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eventually, Kyle steals a pickup truck, showing off how the addition of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast provides enhanced mobility and ways to physically engage hordes. Of course, vehicles can be damaged, and there's the fuel scarcity to deal with.</p>
<p>The walkthrough concludes with Kyle confronting one of the aforementioned Chimeras, a massive mutated monster. It's here that we get to see Kyle's Beast meter, a special ability gauge that, once filled, allows him to unleash his Beast Mode, granting temporary superhuman powers he gained from all the experiments he was subjected to over the last thirteen years.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches on August 22 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
