			<p>Later this week, <strong>Sony</strong> is set to host its first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a> </strong>event of 2026. This hour-long showcase will include several announcements we could guess at, and many we won't be able to, but a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has pretty much cemented one of the announcements that we'll see at Thursday's show (if we don't see it tomorrow): the games entering the <strong>PS Plus Extra Catalog</strong> for February 2026. Which, according to the report, will be headlined by <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</strong></p>



<p>The first of <strong>Insomniac's</strong> Spider-Man titles, <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> (the remastered variant, that is), entered the PS Plus Extra library of games <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">back in <strong>August 2025</strong></a>. With <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong> already included in the catalog, this means that players who sign up for the second tier of <strong>PlayStation's</strong> subscription service will be able to play all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games so far.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game mentioned in the Dealabs report, as it also cites that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/neva-the-gris-follow-up-from-nomada-studio-receives-beautiful-new-gameplay-trailer/">Neva</a>,</strong> the follow-up to the critically acclaimed <strong>Gris</strong> from <strong>Nomada Studio</strong>, will enter the catalog alongside Spider-Man 2, as will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a></strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE 🚨</p><p>A big PS5 Console Exclusive is Coming to PS Plus Extra (Game Catalog)</p><p>Yes, it will be<br>🕷️ Marvel's Spider-Man 2</p><p>We reveal 2 other headliners in our latest report<br>(Other titles may be revealed tomorrow or during next State of Play)<a href="https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR">https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/2021255882273620133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There will undoubtedly be more games than just those three entering the catalog, but those are the only ones mentioned in the report. Normally, it's worth taking any leaks you see ahead of showcases like Thursday's upcoming State of Play with a grain of salt, but in this case, you'll want to add more salt to the pile. Dealabs and Billbil-kun have an extremely strong record of revealing PS Plus news ahead of time.</p>



<p>So, at least in this case, we can bet that we'll see Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Neva, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown as part of the PS Plus Extra games for February 2026.</p>



<p>PS Plus subscribers at every tier can already enjoy <strong>Undisputed, Ultros, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">PS Plus Essential games</a> for February 2026 (which, unsurprisingly, were leaked ahead of time by Dealabs).</p>

			<p>PlayStation is ready to reclaim the spotlight after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/"><strong>Xbox Developer Direct</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>. After a quiet start to the year, Sony has officially pulled back the curtain on a massive February State of Play, which promises to be a beefy broadcast that will set the tone for the PS5’s 2026 lineup.</p>



<p>With rumors of new <strong>first-party reveals</strong> and <strong>long-awaited updates on third-party projects</strong>, here is everything you need to know about the upcoming showcase.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-and-where-to-watch-state-of-play-february-2026">When and Where to Watch State of Play February 2026</h2>



<p>Sony has confirmed that this State of Play will feature a vast selection of games <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">over its 60-minute</strong> runtime, making it one of the <strong>longest State of Play presentations ever.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation will be hosting the stream on its official channels on <strong>February 12 from 2:00 PM PT, 5:00 PM ET, 10:00 PM GMT, and 11:00 PM CET.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>



<p>On the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PlayStation Blog</a></strong>, Sony has explicitly stated that this broadcast will feature a look at "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>." With no game officially confirmed to be shown, however, speculation has begun on what we should expect to see.</p>



<h3 id="h-hardware-news">Hardware News</h3>

<p>With the <strong>PlayStation 6 and rumored PlayStation handheld console still far from release</strong>, no next-gen hardware reveal should be expected. However, there still could be some hardware announcements, as a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-low-key-success-and-a-very-good-idea-the-rumored-updated-playstation-portal-could-be-the-best-answer-to-hardware-price-increases/">PS Portal OLED model is rumored to be in the works</a></strong>.

<p>As the latest news from teams at PlayStation Studios will be shared during this State of Play, it stands to reason we will hear more about multiple first-party games, including <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/"><strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-playstation-5-pro-shows-its-muscles-by-delivering-5k-resolution-rendering-in-marathon/"><strong>Marathon</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/"><strong>Saros</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/"><strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong></a>,</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/"><strong>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</strong></a></em> (whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/"><strong>Steam page</strong></a> was recently updated to confirm the 20-character big launch roster). A new look at Naughty Dog's <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a></strong></em> would be a nice surprise.</p>



<p>New reveals could also be in the cards. Will Cory Barlog's new IP, or the rumored<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"> <strong>2.5D Metroidvania God of War</strong></a> be announced this week?</p>



<h3 id="h-third-party-studios-games">Third-Party Studios Games</h3>

<p>With games like <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-second-features-overview-combat-depth-progression/"><strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a></em> launching in the next few weeks, <strong>new looks</strong> at these highly anticipated games could be possible. <span><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/"><strong>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</strong></a></em>&nbsp;has been absent from the spotlight for some time, so a new look at the game and a </span>release date announcement during the event would not be too surprising. Rumors suggest <em>Devil May Cry 6</em> could also be revealed during the event.</p>



<p>As the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy development team has been speaking at length about <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/we-nailed-it-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-was-really-looking-forward-to-recreating-this-very-emotional-scene/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the third and final entry in the series</strong></a>, a reveal of the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">name and the first footage</strong> wouldn't really be surprising, even though it's been suggested that this game will not launch as a PlayStation 5 exclusive like its predecessor, and will be available from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">day one also on PC, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></a></p>

			<p><strong>Supermassive Games</strong>, the studio you'll recognize as the team behind games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">Until Dawn</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/"><strong>The Quarry</strong>,</a> has announced the release date for their next narrative-driven horror adventure, <strong>Directive 8020</strong>. This new sci-fi entry in Supermassive's <strong>Dark Pictures</strong> anthology will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming <strong>May 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The news was announced with a new release date trailer, which also ushered in the launch of pre-orders going live on both PS5 and Xbox Series. Pre-orders for the game on Steam will go live "<em>soon</em>" according to the video description, so just keep an eye on your Steam notifications if you already have it wishlisted for when those pre-orders are ready.</p>



<p>The trailer dubs Directive 8020 as "<em>a new chapter of horror</em>," while showcasing plenty of gameplay and the difficult decisions you'll be forced to make in Supermassive's latest terrifying adventure. You can check out the new trailer below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Directive 8020 - Comply | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Technically, we first heard about Directive 8020 all the way back in 2022, but that notice came from the public release of a bundle of titles Supermassive had <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/five-new-the-dark-pictures-titles-trademarked-supermassive-games/">trademarked</a></strong>. It wasn't until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">2024</a> that the game was properly announced, with a release date initially set for 2025.</p>



<p>However, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">a round of layoffs</a></strong> at Supermassive pushed the game out of its October 2025 release window and into 2026. Thankfully, today's announcement confirms that we didn't have to wait too much longer after it missed its October release, as it is still arriving in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The last time we saw Directive 8020 was at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>, where Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got to spend half an hour with the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/directive-8020-gamescom-hands-on-previews-a-new-page-in-the-anthology/">In his preview</a>, he highlighted how the addition of real-time threats sets Directive 8020 apart from other games in the Dark Pictures Anthology, and how, alongside its new tier of graphic fidelity and all-star cast, Directive 8020 looks set to "<em>mark a new beginning</em>" for Supermassive's Dark Pictures games. Or, as Supermassive puts it in today's trailer: "<em><strong>a new chapter of horror</strong></em>."</p>
