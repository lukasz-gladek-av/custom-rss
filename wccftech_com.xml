			<p>Valve believes the new Steam Machine can succeed where the first models failed, and according to two senior engineers, the reason is simple: the software finally caught up, leading to a wider game catalogue.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Yazan Aldehayyat stated that one of the reasons the original Steam Machines failed was the lack of software, as very few games were compatible with SteamOS (based on Linux), and only a few games could run well using other compatibility tools like Wine.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier," </em>Aldehayyat said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows.</em>"</p>



<p>Pierre-Loup Griffais echoes the sentiment, saying that the small game catalogue was the reason the older Steam Machines failed, highlighting that many of the features of the new Steam Machine, such as the ease of use that's closer to a console than a PC, were already there. And with the system seeing limited adoption, developers had no incentive to develop Linux ports of their games. The work done on Proton since the launch of the Steam Deck has now ensured the new Steam Machine will have a big game catalogue from launch.</p>



<p>SteamOS has also been improved a lot since the launch of the original Steam Machine, and plenty of performance optimization work has been done on the operating system to improve the Steam Deck performance. For the new system, Valve has done <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff,"</em> and now, it is expected that the same performance advantages introduced on Steam Deck over time after its launch with work on SteamOS will be available on the new Steam Machine as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-with-good-software-optimization-the-new-steam-machine-could-punch-well-above-its-specs">With Good Software Optimization, the new Steam Machine Could Punch Well Above Its Specs</h2>



<p>The new Valve system won't be a powerhouse exactly. Its official technical specifications, revealed earlier this week, which you can find below, position the system between the Xbox Series S and the PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Although the new Steam Machine is expected to run games at 4K@60Hz, early tests suggest some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, may struggle to hit these performance targets. The system, however, is still far from launch, and with further improvements to its software side, the new Steam Machine could deliver better performance than in its current pre-release state, although the 8 GB of VRAM is definitely a limiting factor, and will be even more so in the future.</p>



<p>And if the new Steam Machine becomes as popular as the Steam Deck, it wouldn't be surprising to see either presets dedicated to the machine or even Steam Machine native builds that deliver better performance, as we have seen with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-native-steam-deck-build-performance/">Cronos: The New Dawn native builds.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-price-will-determine-the-steam-machine-s-success">Price Will Determine the Steam Machine's Success</h2>



<p>With the game catalogue issue of the original Steam Machines solved, it will likely be the price that determines the success of the Steam Machine. Valve is well aware of this, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Yazan Aldehayyat confirmed it will be very competitive</a>. How much it will be remains to be seen, as the cost of the system when <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">it launches early next year</a> has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>Just days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">NCSoft and Guerrilla Games revealed the long-anticipated MMO</a> set within Sony's Horizon universe, Horizon Steel Frontiers, and it looked like just about everything you might've expected from a Horizon MMO, which is to say that it looks like it'll be extremely fun and exciting to play. But, surprisingly, the reveal carried one glaring omission: it's not coming to PS5; it'll only launch on PC and mobile.</p>



<p>Why a new game made in collaboration with one of Sony's first-party PlayStation Studios, based on a Sony-owned, first-party IP, is not coming to Sony's flagship console is the million-dollar question surrounding Horizon Steel Frontiers, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">Eurogamer</a>), we get a bit of insight into the answer behind that million-dollar question.</p>



<p>According to NCSoft executive producer Lee Song, the studio has no problem bringing Horizon Steel Frontiers to PS5. In fact, it wants to deliver the game on PS5. So why wasn't PS5 one of the listed platforms when it was revealed? Well, it appears we'll have to ask Sony.</p>



<p>NCSoft has "<em>no reason</em>," Song said, not to bring the game to PS5. "<em>We would like to do it,</em>" he added, "<em>but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions</em>."</p>



<p>So if NCSoft is gun-ho to bring Horizon Steel Frontiers to PlayStation consoles, the remaining conclusion is that Sony is, for reasons unknown, blocking the game from its flagship console. </p>



<p>Perhaps it will eventually come to PS5, but Sony wants it to launch elsewhere as part of its plans to expand its reach outside of the PlayStation ecosystem on other platforms. Perhaps it figures that there's already a fan base of Horizon fans who will play Steel Frontiers on PS5 whenever it arrives on the console, but it would prefer to try and build a base of players on mobile and PC first, before going to the players it knows will buy into Steel Frontiers whenever it arrives on PlayStation.</p>



<p>Or perhaps Sony doesn't want Steel Frontiers on PlayStation at all, to keep a differentiating line between the experiences it delivers to console and the ones it'll bring to PC and mobile. All we can do is speculate, until Sony provides an answer, if it ever does. But at least we know who to ask.</p>
