						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>F1 games are ones I've played quite a lot in the past. Most of them, in reality. Having seen Codemasters grow the series and their acquisition by EA, it would always be interesting to see how they progress the series in the future. It was also going to be interesting because, and let's be completely honest, F1 as a motorsport does not change much, so what have Codemasters and EA done in F1 25 to make it stand apart from the rest?</p>
<p>Brad Pitt, that's what they've done. I didn't even know there was a film based on F1 coming out, but now I do, thanks to the game and the fact that I have spent my time on F1 25 playing as Mr Pitt himself.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So what is the link? Aside from them both being based on motorsport, Sonny Hayes is one of the drivers with the team from the film that you can take behind the wheel, even running a whole career mode as them rather than creating a different fictional team from scratch. This is what I did most of my time with the game: I played the My Team career mode, controlling APxGP and pushing them from the bottom to the top, all while keeping <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/7b/Tylerbetterpicture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170410170911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Durden</a> front and centre.</p>
<p>As you interact more with the drivers and backroom, the My Team mode feels more responsive and interactive than before. You will keep track of your rating by fans and their current sentiment, driven by your performance on the course. Your finances will be driven by the number of staff in each of your departments and their wages, your sponsorships, and, naturally, linked to your performance on the track. Do better, everything gets better. This is particularly true when you happen to enter a rivalry and beat them.</p>
<p>Between these, you will research and develop new parts that can be attached to your drivers and their cars. You will invest in your HQ, improve different facilities to increase staffing, and train your owner to get even more bonuses. It all creates a good sense of progression as you move from a brand-new team with few resources to a masterclass team with the best car on the track.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Of course, all of this is easier if you're good on the track. If there's one thing to say about F1 25, it's that it's the most realistic venture Codemasters has put out. Several tracks have been scanned using LIDAR (Laser imaging detection and ranging), which means every single centimetre is accurate in width and height. Not all tracks have been created using LIDAR, and some have had new features. Silverstone, for example, allows you to race in reverse.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the circuits, the elements surrounding the track add to the atmosphere. Codemasters gave an example in the build-up to release: the cherry blossoms around Suzuka, in the same place as real life. This adds to the exceptional visual quality and the feeling of being part of the race.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit that at this point, I'm pretty terrible at the F1 games when I have zero assistance. I don't have everything on, and I don't like feeling railroaded. Still, I do tend to need the help to stop me spinning out and essentially creating a Final Destination moment as my car goes careening off into the spectators, killing dozens. Maybe the next tie-in Codemasters and EA could consider, though?</p>
<p>I find the handling and general racing to feel excellent, particularly when you find that balance where it's manageable for you, without making it too easy by crippling the AI. Added to this are other options that can make the game as sim or arcade as you like, even getting to the point where you can turn off penalties for turning it into Destruction Derby. This will always be a positive in any game, allowing you to play however you want.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Now, there are some negatives with F1 25. I'm used to unskippable cutscenes and other annoying elements in your bigger story-focused titles, and they can be annoying. For an F1 game, it wasn't something on my bingo list. The build-up to a race feels a little too realistic, in that you're listening to commentators talk about how your special brand of rubber is the exact one used in a mastodon's condom, which is why it's perfect for corner 9, compared to that of the other teams. Those specific words may not be used, but it feels like they're trying too hard to set the scene, rather than letting me get behind the wheel.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm exactly fond of the microtransactions either, specifically because you can buy XP boosts. If they were <em>just</em> for cosmetic items, of which there are loads, I could live with it. XP boosts, though, I'll never support pay-to-win or pay-to-progress in a full-priced title. Ever.</p>
<p>Back to the positives. The four game modes give you something to enjoy, and while it isn't all out yet, due to the film not being out, I am strangely looking forward to following the story of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg/250px-Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg">Louis de Pointe du Lac</a>. This is even though I find the Breaking Point mode too railroaded. It seems the inclusion of <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cdacd630c67926f7fea3f72/1:1/w_1669,h_1669,c_limit/MCDTROY_EC007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Achilles</a> is what makes the story interesting.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The more I play F1 games, the harder it is to talk about them. This is particularly true when the advancements are less noticeable. Codemasters have taken some steps forward, certainly in terms of the accuracy of the tracks and in improving the handling. Still, their most significant step forward for me is expanding My Team. I want to see more, but I'm glad to take what I can for now. All in all, I would recommend F1 25. It's a very good racing game, and it's still the F1 game which will give you the closest F1 experience, warts and all.</p>

				<p>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Strong handling and car mechanics
</li><li>Excellently presented, and looks fantastic

							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Breaking point is boring - far too railroaded
</li><li>Sometimes they can focus too much of presentation - with unskippable scenes, dialogue or tutorial

			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> another important sales milestone today, having surpassed 3.3 million units sold 33 days after launch. The turn-based JRPG created by Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive is one of the biggest surprise hits of 2025 so far. It has received unanimous acclaim from critics (getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.5 score</a> from us) and fans, too.</p>
<p>Today, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Kepler Interactive portfolio director Matthew Handrahan and Sandfall Interactive COO and producer François Meurisse. Among various things, the two credited the game with not dragging on for too long and challenged the view that longer games are better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>Handrahan:</strong> One of the things that's great about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is it really respects the player's time. It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay. It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger.</em></p>
<p><em>Brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming. Something can be better by being shorter – something that's being discussed in film at the moment. Every film seems to be two and a half hours long, and I think most people are like, 'Can they all be a bit shorter, please? Because we have other things to do with our lives'.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>François</strong> <strong>Meurisse:</strong> From the beginning, we wanted to do an intense and short experience. The first length estimates of the game were closer to 20 hours for the main quest. I think we ended up closer to 30, even 40 hours if you take a bit of time. As a player, there are so many great games out there that I want to experience, and what's important to me is the level of excitement and fun I get from a game, rather than how long it is.</em></p>
<p><em>The value that players get from games does not align systematically with the length of the game. For example, one of my favourite games of all time is Inside, which lasts about two hours, but it's one of the most polished and intense experiences – and even life changing for some people.</em></p>
