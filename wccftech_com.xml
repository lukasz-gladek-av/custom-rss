			<p>Bloodborne's emulation on PC is continuing to get improved almost daily, thanks to new updates to the ShadPS4 emulator and mods that improve the game's visuals to provide a truly remastered experience.</p>
<p>The latest work-in-progress build of the ShadPS4 emulator, version 0.4.1, addresses some of the issues that have been causing frequent crashing while playing the PlayStation 4 exclusive on PC, such as RAM usage spikes, and excessive VRAM usage, as reported in a new video shared by tabeneru on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>. The new version of the emulator seems to reduce VRAM usage considerably, so the game should now run better on a variety of system configurations.</p>

<p>Besides general emulation improvements that are also benefiting the game, Bloodborne is getting improved by the hard work of modders. Today, a new version of the Enable Dynamic Shadow mod was released on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/160?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, further improving the dynamic shadows the mod introduces. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements-video/">fromsoftserve's remastering project</a> also does the same, this mod is being manually tuned for the best results. You can check out how much dynamic shadows improve the game's visuals in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Bloodborne is only one of the games that the ShadPS4 emulator can run reasonably well on PC. More information on the emulator that is making it possible to enjoy the popular PS4 exclusive at its best can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks stunning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/">path tracing</a>, but even the most powerful GPUs currently on the market cannot run the game at native 4K resolution and max setting at anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Making some compromises in terms of settings and resolution, however, definitely looks worth it, as path tracing makes the game developed by MachineGames outright stunning, as highlighted in a comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TyrianYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyrian</a> on YouTube. The video also clearly shows how an RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 60 FPS during the introduction sequence at 4K resolution and with NVIDIA DLSS at the Balanced setting.</p>

<p>Much like the other games supporting path tracing like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes it pretty clear that it will be some time until it will be possible to run games with full path tracing at high native resolutions, as even an RTX 4090 cannot push past the 30 FPS mark at native 4K resolution and max settings, as shown in the test shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mostly_Positive_Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mostly Positive Reviews</a>. The most powerful GPU on the market struggles at native 1440p resolution as well, barely hitting the 50 FPS range in the most demanding of the two testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Besides looking incredible, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is also a great game to play.
