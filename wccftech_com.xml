			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard delivers decent image quality and great performance on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, complete with ray tracing in Quality Mode.</p>
<p>In a new tech review posted a few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the console versions of the latest entry in the series by BioWare, confirming details such as resolution, visual features, and more. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game runs at 1080p resolution, upscaled to 4K using a custom version of AMD FSR 2.2 complete with some ray tracing features like ray-traced reflections and ambient occlusion in Quality Mode, and at 720p, upscaled to 1440p using dynamic resolution that can drop as low as 504p. Still, AMD FSR 2.2 seems to be doing a decent job, and image quality isn't massively impacted even with such low resolution, although it is definitely noticeable under scrutiny. Performance, at least, seems to be solid, consistently hitting the 60 FPS target.</p>
<p>Things don't fare as well on Xbox Series S. On the system, Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs at 648p in Quality Mode and 432p in Performance Mode, targeting 30 and 60 FPS, respectively. Despite some issues, such as a lack of motion blur in Quality Mode that prevents the 30 FPS gameplay from being smoother and lower image quality in Performance Mode, Digital Foundry found the experience serviceable on the system.</p>

			<p>THE BROTHERHOOD, an independent game development studio based in Cape Town, South Africa, and known for the games STASIS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/beautiful-desolation-kickstarter-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beautiful Desolation</a>, has recently announced a new game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Use Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous titles, which were point-and-click isometric adventure games, Animal Use Protocol is a full-fledged 3D first-person horror game made in Unreal Engine 5. The trailer already shows excellent visuals and the preliminary PC system requirements are suitably high.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</em><br>

<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon RX 580</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: To Achieve a solid 30FPS at default Settings.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>

<p>As you might have guessed already from the game's title, Animal Usage Control is heavily themed around animals. You'll play as a highly intelligent chimpanzee called Penn who is attempting an escape from a laboratory where animals are being experimented on. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulator, and a scrappy rat sidekick called Trip, you'll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station while being relentlessly pursued by all sorts of monstrous experiments gone wrong.</p>

<p>The developers also promised highly immersive environments, exploration-driven gameplay with interactive objects and environmental storytelling, intense and unscripted encounters with a terrifying enemy, limited resources and inventory management for high-stakes decision-making, and voiced dialogue and audio logs for deep narrative immersion. Development on Animal Use Control started in December 2023 and is scheduled to launch on PC in the latter half of 2026, while a console launch will come later.</p>
