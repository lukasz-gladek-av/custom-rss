			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has just reported its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">third-quarter financial results</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, which covers the last three months of 2025, ending right at the end of the year on December 31, 2025. This is an important distinction to make, only because these results do not include all of the layoffs and restructuring that happened at the start of this year when the company announced its "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>This means that Ubisoft went forward with its plan to reorganize the entire structure of the company and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">layoff hundreds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">workers across</a> multiple of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">its global branches</a> and its own <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">headquarters in Paris</a> while the company was actually doing well on paper. The company reported <strong>double-digit growth</strong> in the quarter, with net bookings coming in at <strong>€338 million,</strong> a <strong>12% increase</strong> from the third quarter of its previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>It was the "<em>overperformance</em>" of the <strong>Assassin's Creed </strong>franchise that drove the increase, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-hands-on/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong> and <strong>The Division</strong> helping push the increase behind it. Its new historical sim, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></strong>, was able to deliver net bookings that outpaced its predecessor, <strong>Anno 1800</strong>. Though its only major live service title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/">Rainbow Six Siege</a></strong>, did not exceed or fall below expectations, it simply landed where Ubisoft thought it would, which Ubisoft partially attributes to a "<em>particularly crowded</em>" first-person shooter market.</p>



<p>"<em>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations</em>," said Ubisoft chief executive officer and the guy who recently installed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">his son in one of the company's highest-ranking positions</a>, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>. "<em>This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players</em>."</p>



<p>Guillemot went on to say that the company is "<em>making progress on the transformation announced in January</em>," with key positions within the new structure still being filled, with some of the roles set to be filled by <em>"external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans</em>." Which sounds exactly like <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">the kinds of people they lost</a> in this restructuring, either through layoffs or <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">individuals looking towards greener pastures</a>.</p>



<p>The one bit of forward-looking news we got was that the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/">The Division Resurgence</a></strong> is set to be revealed "<em>soon</em>," according to the report, with no mention of the long-rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></strong> remake/remaster, or anything else coming up from the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

			<p><span>Earlier today,&nbsp;<strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>&nbsp;published its Q4 2025 earnings report, and in the <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss2025Q4_eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent earnings call</a>, the South Korean company revealed interesting tidbits about what it will focus on after the imminent launch of&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Desert</strong>.</span> The executives revealed that, depending on market demand (that is to say, depending on how well the game sells), Pearl Abyss <strong>already has plans to potentially add downloadable content and even multiplayer</strong>.</p>



<p>As you probably remember, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually supposed to be an MMO at first</a></strong>. Then it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an open world game with multiplayer elements</a>, but in the last few years, Pearl Abyss hasn't referred to multiplayer at all. It seems like <strong>they haven't entirely abandoned the plans to add multiplayer modes</strong>; rather, they focused on completing the single player experience first.</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss also explained why Crimson Desert took much longer than anticipated. The reason is the concurrent development of the BlackSpace Engine, but they are now confident that, with the technology ready, they'll be able to accelerate work on the next games, the open world creature collecting game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dokev-an-open-world-creature-collecting-game-by-pearl-abyss-resurfaces-with-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DokeV</a></strong> and the exosuit shooter game <strong>Plan 8</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Since we have reached the stabilization stage of the BlackSpace Engine, we now have an environment where, from the next title DokeV, we can concentrate our efforts on just developing the game alone. Accordingly, we believe that we will have a great reduction in the development time of different projects. In addition, through the development of Crimson Desert, we have now accumulated significant internal experience and know-how regarding Console. So we believe that by efficiently managing development and other preparatory work, we will have a smaller launch gap between new titles.</em></p>



<p>DokeV in particular already <strong>garnered attention</strong> thanks to the Gamescom 2021 trailer. Pearl Abyss acknowledged that fans have been left without any updates, but clarified that Crimson Desert remains the focus, which is why they couldn't share any news about that game. Now, <strong>they believe it should take about two years after the debut of Crimson Desert to launch it</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Considering the launch preparation experience of Crimson Desert, taking into account that at least one year or so of preparation for launching was needed even after game completion, it seems about 2 years of time will be needed after the launch of Crimson Desert for DokeV. </em></p>



<p>The good news is that some sort of communication about DokeV should start later this year. We'll let you know once that happens. In other Crimson Desert news, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared more information about the game's non-combat activities</a></strong>.</p>

			<p>While <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">1,200 Ubisoft employees</a></strong> are on strike this week in response to the company's recent "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>," yet another piece of evidence regarding the heavily rumoured <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> remaster has appeared online. Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=04knYK8dAZ2TRI8dBP6GJEH">Amazon UK listing</a> for an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered art book is up and available for pre-orders. It also, interestingly, has a <strong>March 24, 2026, release date</strong> attached to it.</p>



<p>What makes the art book seem legit, beyond the fact that Ubisoft is listed as the book's author, is that <strong>Titan</strong>, the publisher behind <a href="https://titanbooks.com/catalog/?q=assassin%27s%20creed&amp;page=1">several Assassin's Creed artbooks</a>, is also listed as the publisher for this upcoming book. The book is listed at <strong>£39.99 RRP</strong>, though if it is real, you can grab it on sale right now for <strong>£29.95</strong>.</p>



<p>Assuming this is a legitimate listing, firstly, the release date listed for the art book <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">does line up with what we've previously heard</a> about when the rumoured remaster is set to release. Secondly, the fact that this listing has even appeared lines up with what we heard earlier this week about the coming remaster, which is that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">are due for a reveal in the near future</a> (though not at tonight's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, reportedly).</p>



<p>One interesting thing to note about this art book, however, is that according to a <strong>PEGI rating</strong> spotted back in December 2025, the remaster is officially titled <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a></strong>. Again, if the art book is real, this could just be a placeholder title for the listing, or even just a mistake on the part of whoever inputted the information for the listing.</p>



<p>We've seen several reports and rumours about this upcoming remaster/remake for years now. It's arguably one of the worst-kept secrets in the video game industry, and yet, we've had nothing official from Ubisoft. The French company had no problem <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">threatening the actor who played Black Flag protagonist <strong>Edward Kenway</strong> with a lawsuit</a> for even slightly suggesting the remaster was coming soon, but as of yet, it won't confirm one way or another if the remaster/remake is even happening.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear something sooner rather than later, so we can put this run of rumours and reports to rest and focus on what's actually coming down the pipeline.</p>
