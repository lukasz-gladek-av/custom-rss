			<p>Although modern video games can sometimes be too easy, some players still manage to find a challenge in them by performing extreme feats of mastery that attract the utmost admiration from each game's community.</p>



<p>Despite being a turn-based role-playing game where such feats often boil down to build-perfecting and long hours of grinding, with its parry mechanics, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong> allows for some masterful play that can enable underleveled characters with an unoptimized build to defeat some of the most powerful bosses in the game... <strong>pulling an 8-hour shift.</strong></p>



<p>On the game's <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official subreddit Expedition 33</a></strong>, user <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Recordbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recordbreaks</a></strong> proved their name is no joke by sharing a screenshot of the result screen after their battle against the <strong>Duolliste Boss</strong>, the most difficult boss fight added to the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/"><strong>Thank You Update released for free last month.</strong></a></p>



<p>The numbers on the screenshot speak for themselves. <strong>Recordbreaks</strong> defeated the powerful boss in <strong>8:02:36 minutes</strong>, successfully <strong>parrying 10,545 times</strong> over the boss's two phases, a feat that is made even more impressive not only by the boss's moveset featuring some <strong>unnatural parry timings</strong> meant to throw players off but also by the <strong>huge pressure</strong> this player will have felt during the gruelling 8 hours spent fighting this boss.</p>

			<p>We're officially in 2026 at the time of this writing, and everyone across the world is simultaneously looking back at the year that was and ahead at what's to come. For Dispatch developer <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, that reflection took the form of a highlight reel showing off several in-game statistics about how active players have been in their debut game, and capping the video by announcing the game had sold <strong>over 3 million copies</strong> since launch.</p>



<p><strong><em>Warning! Spoilers for Dispatch to follow.</em></strong></p>



<p>The video was shared <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/2006757644250337294">across the studio's official social media accounts</a>, thanking players who dove in and dispatched <strong>over 1 billion heroes</strong> over the course of <strong>52.5 million completed shifts</strong> and <strong>727 million distress calls</strong> answered. It also included a few stats based on the choices players made, including 2.8 million players choosing to cut Coupe from Z-Team, and 1.6 million choosing Sonar.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 2.3 million players added Waterboy to the team, and 2 million added Phenomaman. Perhaps the more significant stat regarding the game's story was the fact that 2.4 million players chose to keep Invisigal on the team, while 1.1 million of them cut her. Invisigal was also the character that more Dispatch players romanced over Blonde Blazer by a margin of 0.9 million, while 164K players stayed single and didn't romance anyone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ahead of the final stat (the over 3 million players), another key figure that popped up was the fact that people watched over 23 million hours of Dispatch-related content on YouTube and Twitch. Copies sold are one thing, but it's also incredibly significant in today's day and age to have a game with that much virality to it.</p>



<p>All together, it's clear that Dispatch has been an incredibly successful return <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-telltale-devs-the-wolf-among-us-2-adhoc-dispatch/">for the former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio</a>. The game is currently not available on subscription services like PS Plus or Xbox Game Pass (it's not even out on Xbox yet), so those 'over 3 million dispatchers' the video lists each represent a copy of Dispatch sold. A huge achivement for any game, let alone one with an entirely narrative-over-gameplay focus.</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/">Wccftech's Best Adventure games of 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our Best Games overall</a>. Hopefully, this level of quality not only continues, but improves as AdHoc Studio moves towards its next project, whether that's more episodes of Dispatch or something else entirely. In any case, the game is due to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">another injection of players when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on January 29, 2026</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“The People in Charge are Psychopaths” Says Adam Jensen Voice Actor on Why There’s No New Deus Ex Game Coming in 2026]]></title>

			<p><strong>Elias Toufexis</strong>, a voice actor who you may recognize as the voice of Remi Letam from 2025's Hell is Us, but who you're more likely to recognize as the voice of <strong>Adam Jensen</strong> from <strong>Eidos Montreal's Deus Ex</strong> games, has a few strong words for those in charge of the immersive-sim franchise.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Toufexis shared four images to tell fans what he's working on in 2026. One of the photos was Marathon, while the other three were simple 'NDA' watermarks, indicating he's got at least four projects on the go and only one he can talk about.</p>



<p>Though if you were hoping one of those NDA'd projects would be a new Deus Ex game, that is unfortunately not the case. Toufexis followed up his initial post with a single-line shot directly at <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and its decision makers.</p>



<p>"<em>...No Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths</em>," Toufexis wrote.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">....no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths.</p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The last two Deus Ex games, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, are both excellent immersive-sim, third-person stealth games that were unfortunately never as commercially successful as they were critically. That said, the franchise has a long and important place in gaming history, and it's hard to imagine there's no desire for a new game in the series.</p>



<p>But that doesn't seem to be enough for the people actually making the call on whether to greenlight production on a new Deus Ex game. Embracer Group reportedly<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/"> shut down the revival project at Eidos Montreal in January 2024</a>. Another <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/">report from April 2025 claims that Eidos tried pitching a new Deus Ex game to multiple publishers</a> but got no traction on the idea because they were told the series is too much of a niche. </p>



<p>It seems clear that Eidos Montreal would be more than willing to return to the world of Deus Ex. Besides the fact that the studio was pitching a new entry in the series just last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-may-return-embracer-outdo-cyberpunk-rumor/">it sees the series as an opportunity to "<em>do what Cyberpunk 2077 couldn't</em>."</a></p>



<p>But since Eidos voiced that goal, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/">has suffered multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/">layoffs and project cancellations</a>, and the latest on what the team is actually working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-open-world-action-adventure-game-tomb-raider-team-out-next-year/">is a return to Tomb Raider and Lara Croft.</a></p>



<p>There technically is a Deus Ex game on the way, but it's a remaster of the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-remastered-delayed-indefinitely-pre-orders-refunded-aspyr-media/">that was just delayed indefinitely due to backlash and feedback from its reveal</a>. Still, fans of the franchise can only hope Eidos Montreal finds a path forward for a new adventure in the Deus Ex world.</p>
