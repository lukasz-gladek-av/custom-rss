			<p>Over the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> has done an excellent job keeping the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em></strong> series in the spotlight by releasing remakes of the first four entries in the series alongside new entries in the series, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a></em></strong>. This approach not only provided fans of the series with multiple entries to enjoy, but also revitalized it, which had looked like it was losing what made it so special with the widely criticized sixth entry.</p>



<p>2026 looks set to be an excellent year for fans of the series. In a little over a month, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong> will launch on <strong>PC</strong> and consoles, marking the return of <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> to a mainline entry in the series and a dual gameplay style that looks incredibly compelling.</p>



<p>The launch of the ninth main entry in the series, however, isn't everything fans reportedly have to look forward to despite the disappointing lack of news of this month's <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></em></strong>, as another <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> remake will be announced in the coming months, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>Addressing community speculation fueled by a social media post made by <strong>Eva La Dare</strong>, the voice actress of <strong>Sheva</strong>, protagonist of the fifth entry in the series together with <strong>Chris Redfield</strong>, who teased something for the series' <strong>30th anniversary</strong> this <strong>March</strong>, known series <strong><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider Dusk Golem reported</a></strong> that <em>"there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year."</em></p>



<p><em>"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you,"</em> the insider continued. While a remake of the survival horror game, which made its debut on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">SEGA Dreamcast</strong> in early <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2000</strong> has been<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/"> rumored to be in the works for a while</a></strong>, this is the first time we heard that it could be revealed ahead of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Zero</em></strong> remake, which has also been rumored to be in the works for a while.</p>



<p>While we have to take what Dusk Golem revealed with a grain of salt, the insider has proven quite reliable with both older and more recent Resident Evil series rumors. Last year, the insider revealed that Leon would be the second Resident Evil Requiem protagonist, ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"><strong>confirmation during this year's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</em> show.</strong></a></p>



<p>Following the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 4</em></strong> remake, which improved the original without revolutionizing the original formula which aged quite well, it will be exciting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> will modernize <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Code Veronica</em></strong> in its remake.</p>



<p>The original's formula is based into the series' roots, and has quite a few divisive narrative and gameplay choices, including the infamous <strong>Fire Extinguisher trap</strong> which may prevent players from obtaining a powerful weapon, sudden character swaps between <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Claire</strong>, excessive backtracing and some harsh difficulty spikes which would definitely need to be addressed to keep the series momentum going strong as it has in the past few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in October 2025, shortly after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> unveiled its subsidiary, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong>, a new branch formed in partnership with <strong>Tencent</strong> to house the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six</strong>, and <strong>Far Cry </strong>franchises, head of the Assassin's Creed series, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté, </strong>was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">confirmed to be leaving the company by Ubisoft</a>. While Ubisoft initially framed Côté's departure as his choice, saying that he declined a role within Vantage Studios and that he had "<em></em><em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," three days later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Côté published his own statement</a>, saying he didn't choose to leave, but that instead "<em></em><em><strong>Ubisoft asked me to step aside</strong></em>."</p>



<p>While Côté claimed that he held "<em>no resentment</em>" at the time, that statement appears to be in question after <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio-Canada</a> reported that Côté is now <strong>suing Ubisoft for $1.3 million,</strong> accusing Ubisoft of "<em>constructive dismissal</em>" to avoid paying him severance.</p>



<p>Côté had been with Ubisoft for two decades, with the majority of that time spent working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and the final three years of his tenure as the head of the entire series. The suit alleges that in the summer of 2025, a meeting was held to discuss a new "<em>head of franchise</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which Côté noticed would swallow up most of the responsibilities he had in his current position.</p>



<p>Côté was instead offered a "<em>head of production</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which would fall under the newly created "<em>head of franchise</em>" role, and see Côté lose most of his influence over the Assassin's Creed series and the responsibility to lead partnerships with external studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/"><strong>Netflix</strong>, which is currently working on a new Assassin's Creed TV show.</a> According to the report, in Côté's current position, he directly reported to no one save for Ubisoft's long-time boss and chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>.</p>



<p>After declining the head of production role, Côté was then reportedly offered a "<em>creative house</em>" lead, which would allow him to oversee "<em>second-tier</em>" Ubisoft series. With Côté seeing himself as the "<em>guardian of the Assassin's Creed</em>" series after having been with it for so long and having spent three years at its helm, he considered the positions offered a demotion, the kind he could not accept. As he was "<em>disoriented, confused and affected by the anxiety-provoking situation</em>," according to the suit, Côté took two weeks off to reflect on how to move forward.</p>



<p>He was reportedly told that he would have to make a decision at the end of his two weeks as to whether he would accept the role offered. At the end of the two weeks, Côté determined the role was an "<em>unacceptable demotion</em>," and asked to be paid severance. Ubisoft reportedly responded by telling Côté not to come to work on October 13, and the next day, on October 14, an internal email was sent to staff outlining that Côté had "<em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," the same email that broke to the press that day. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleges that Ubisoft has listed Côté's departure as a "<em>voluntary</em> <em>departure</em>" in order to avoid paying him severance. Côté is suing for two years' salary and <strong>$75,000</strong> in moral damages, which the suit is calling "<em>an abuse of power and harm to his reputation</em>." The salary, along with the additional $75K is what brings the total to <strong>$1.3 million<em>.</em></strong> Additionally, Côté is asking that the court lift his non-compete clause, so he can find a new role elsewhere in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on the situation, and we'll update this report if/when we hear back. Côté and his lawyer, Catherine Asselin Jobin, from Poudrier Bradet Avocats, have reportedly declined to make a statement on the matter, save for his lawyer saying, "<em>Mr. Côté</em> <em>hopes for a negotiated, swift, and satisfactory resolution to the situation</em>."</p>



<p>Though we currently only have Côté's side of the story in this matter, and we've yet to see how Ubisoft will claim the situation shook out, this is the second instance of the year already where dismissals at Ubisoft are under suspicion. At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>Ubisoft shuttered its Halifax studio, laying off</strong> <strong>71 people</strong></a> a little less than three weeks after the majority of the branch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">voted to unionize under the CWA Canada</a></strong>.</p>



<p>While Ubisoft claims the studio shutdown had nothing to do with the team unionizing, and claims the decision was made well before organizational efforts at the studio began, CWA Canada has pushed back on that narrative and has filed a complaint with Nova Scotia's labour board, seeking clear evidence from Ubisoft to prove its claims. When the two sides last met, CWA Canada claimed Ubisoft had brought none of the requested evidence.</p>



<p>Public and legal pressure from the CWA Canada has already caused Ubisoft to consider raising the severance it plans to give the 71 fired workers, and CWA Canada continues to apply pressure to the company after it discovered that Ubisoft had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">given <strong>nearly $1 billion</strong> in tax subsidies over the last five years for operating in Halifax</a>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that Marc-Alexis Côté is the second lead of a franchise at Ubisoft to leave the company since the reveal and establishment of Vantage Studios, with The Division lead<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">, <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, announcing his departure just last week</a>. Rumours circulated in October 2025 of his departure, which <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> denied at the time, though with Gerighty set to join <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, his departure doesn't appear to have the same issues that Côté alleges he had.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fire Crews Rushed to Rockstar North Offices Due to Reported “Explosion in a Boiler Room”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-north-fire-explosion-grand-theft-auto-vi/</link>
            <guid>1409971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Edinburgh fire crews rushed to the <strong>Rockstar North</strong> offices on Monday at 5 am BT after a reported "<em>explosion in a boiler room</em>," according to <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> and <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a>. Fire crews stayed on the scene at the <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> developer's office for three hours, working to secure "<em>structural damage</em>" to the building. No casualties have been reported as a result of the incident.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the <strong>Scottish Fire and Rescue Service</strong> <strong>(SFRS)</strong> said, "<em>We were alerted at 5.02 am on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh</em>," in a statement to The Herald. "<em>Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building</em>. <em>There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21 am</em>."</p>



<p>It's unclear what caused the reported explosion at the Rockstar North offices, as the situation continues to be investigated by Police Scotland, and the area reportedly remains cordoned off. Beyond the lack of reported casualties, no injuries have been reported either, a thankful result likely due to the fact that the incident happened so early in the morning.</p>



<p>While thankfully, no one was hurt from the incident, it's unclear how far the reported "<em>structural damage</em>" goes, and what other damage the fire caused to the building and the interior offices. Neither Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive have published a statement regarding the incident, though with Rockstar North being the lead studio for Grand Theft Auto VI, it's likely we'll hear something from Rockstar or Take-Two soon, even if it is just a statement directed towards the company's shareholders and not players, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">to say whether or not the incident will result in yet another delay fro GTA VI.</a></p>



<p>It's also perhaps the most unlikely way anyone thought we'd see the Rockstar North offices back in the news, as the Edinburgh office has been the center of a different story for the last few months. Back at the end of October 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">Rockstar fired 34 workers</a></strong>, several from the Rockstar North offices, with others scattered across the UK and an additional three in Toronto, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">alleging the workers had been leaking confidential information</a>. </p>



<p>The workers and their union, the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), deny the allegations and instead accuse Rockstar of union-busting. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has filed legal claims against Rockstar</a>, and most recently had <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">its bid for interim relief for the fired workers <strong>denied</strong> by a UK judge</a>. </p>



<p>The firings have led to several protests outside of the Rockstar North offices, and Rockstar and Take-Two offices across the globe, including in Paris, New York, and at the Rockstar Toronto offices in Canada, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech spoke with one of the workers fired from Rockstar Toronto and the CWA Canada media union that organized the demonstration</a>.</p>
