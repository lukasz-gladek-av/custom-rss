			<p>Newzoo has released<a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025?utm_campaign=5745787-2025-Newzoo-Press&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-__Dq-HWVzJK08jsx_6t5jYPEY6DxXW-ixoHYynq9c2ftlODIAJQBurdpm-hpCBe74HoSVI9UKPBo2ONoLUJYJ5h29KoQ&amp;_hsmi=350466789&amp;utm_content=350466789&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest report</a> and has also announced that it has implemented new changes that will make the reports more accurate than ever. The company is dedicated to refining its data products so that all information provided about the gaming industry is trustworthy and helps provide a true insight into the industry. This has been achieved by improved data integration with Newzoo's Game Performance Monitor, as well as new acquisitions where they acquired the Steam Data Suite, which is now known as Newzoo's Business Store Intelligence.</p>

<p>As a result of these new changes, Newzoo has created a new report that dives into the industry's global forecast and what comes next in terms of revenue and growth compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Comparing the industry to the last three years, it's set to recover as a whole, to a more mature "new normal." All three platforms (Console, Mobile, PC) are expected to return to growth. However, it won't be a massive amount of growth and will stay in the low single digits. Thus far, it's forecasted to be 3.7%.</p>

<p>The PC market is forecast to grow similarly to the mobile market in the sense that microtransactions, such as in-game cosmetics, loot boxes, and battle passes, will drive the revenue on that platform. Among the PC market, Fortnite and Roblox will continue to remain popular and get consistent engagement, with new content streams being released regularly. Growth in China specifically is expected to slow down, while Japan's popularity will continue to rise over this period.</p>
<p>While some may feel that consoles are dying out, Newzoo predicts that it will instead actually get a major boost, thanks to some upcoming major releases. This includes the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto VI that is set to release this year, which is triggering increased hardware upgrades. While the publishers aren't mentioned, those that are developing titles for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S expect that they will profit from the peak install base.</p>
<p>Thus far, console users are set to have a good amount of games releasing that will bring in a lot of revenue, including Grand Theft Auto VI. Most recently is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which has already proven to be incredibly popular. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also set to release this year, which means there will be some highly-anticipated games from audiences of all ages, including Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The mobile market has reached market maturity, where player growth has lowered significantly to below 3% annually outside of the typical growth regions. Eastern Asia has particularly low player growth compared to other regions.</p>
