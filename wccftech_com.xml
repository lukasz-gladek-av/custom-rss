			<p>German independent developer Shin'en Games announced that The Touryst Deluxe will be released digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on September 25. Pre-orders are already open via the Nintendo eShop at $19.99, and owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Touryst</a> for the original Switch can upgrade for $4.99.</p>



<p>Compared to the original title (which launched in late 2019 for the Switch before making it to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), The Touryst Deluxe will add a new arcade game, new items, new quest, and improved visuals. On the 'docked' or TV mode, it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while handheld mode runs at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. Now, it should be noted that this is by no means a heavy game to run. In fact, it already ran at 4K resolution on the Xbox Series S back in 2020.</p>



<p>Finally, the studio confirmed that users will have the option to import existing save data from The Touryst.</p>

<p>Here's a brief overview of The Touryst, courtesy of the developer:</p>



<p><em>You are just arriving at the Monument Islands. Want to go swimming? Or rather take a dive into the deep sea? Or do you want to visit the amusement arcade, do some shopping, dance at the beach party? Fancy some surfing? Or will you talk with the strange old tourist and listen what he has to say about these ancient mysterious monuments..</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Discover exotic islands and explore ancient monuments</em></li>



<li><em>Climb into deep mines and uncover secret passages</em></li>



<li><em>Make the trip you always wanted and enjoy the tourist life</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Touryst Deluxe will be the second game released by Shin'en for the Nintendo Switch 2 after the launch title <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-nintendo-switch-2-q-new-hd-rumble-is-very-impressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAST FUSION</a>, which also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with HDR support.</p>
