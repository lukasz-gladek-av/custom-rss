			<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for its open-world MMO racing game, The Crew, on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855">March 31, 2024</a>. It was unfortunate news, but not particularly surprising in today's modern age of online games having an expiration date of 'whenever the developer decides it can't/won't pay for the servers anymore.' But while the occurrence of online games being shuttered is now commonplace, The Crew's shutdown sparked something more.</p>



<p>It not only sparked a lawsuit that made players more aware than ever that they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">always been buying a license to play a game</a>, instead of a copy of a game. It sparked enough backlash that Ubisoft committed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. It caused enough uproar that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">Valve added a warning to Steam purchases</a>, making it clear to players they're buying a license to play a game, instead of a copy of the game. And, perhaps most significantly, it was the match that lit the flame under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">Stop Killing Games Initiative</a>.</p>



<p>While the Stop Killing Games and the Stop Destroying Videogames initiatives and petitions continue, and the lawsuit two Californian The Crew fans began is still underway, a group called <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">The Crew Unlimited (TCU)</a> has been working hard to bring The Crew back the old-fashioned way, by creating an emulator to run the servers on.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-tcu-release">TCU realized its goal</a>, and players with a copy of the game can jump back into The Crew thanks to their hard work.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you own a copy of The Crew on PC, then you should be able to set TCU up for yourself to continue playing a game that's shutdown seems to have had more of an impact on the videogame industry than it did when it was still being distributed by Ubisoft.</p>

			<p>SEGA's latest trailer for the next Sonic game calls out Nintendo, and no, we've not time-travelled back to the 80s/90s. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is due out next week at the time of this writing on September 25, 2025, and ahead of that launch, and the release of a demo this coming Wednesday, September 17, SEGA put out a new trailer showcasing CrossWorlds that included a coy call out to Nintendo's Mario Kart franchise.</p>



<p>The trailer is titled, "<em>Come Race on Our Level</em>," and begins with a blurred image of Mario Kart on one screen with a narrator saying, "<em>We all know that kart racing game. It's great. We don't need to show it to you.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But what if you can blast through and race on a whole other level?</em>,<em>"</em> the narrator continues, before diving into a showcase of gameplay from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer goes on to list a few gameplay features in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and before it ends, takes one more shot at Mario Kart, though the second seems more specifically targeted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, by listing a slew of features in CrossWorlds and then saying, "<em>Or, what if you want to roam around on the open road?</em>"</p>



<p>It's all just a bit of fun, of course, but there's a certain tinge of nostalgia the comes from seeing SEGA pull stunts like this.</p>



<p>In any case, players will be able to make up their own minds if Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be worth picking up for their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles or other devices, as a demo will be available on all platforms tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-open-beta-october/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer GFA Games has announced today that its upcoming MMOFPS game Pioner will host an Open Beta test at some point in October. The game is still scheduled to launch later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later time.</p>



<p>Pioner was actually already available <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-demo-confirmed-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a limited time as part of June's Steam Next Fest</a>. Following that test, GFA Games shared some adjustments planned for Pioner's PvP mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Current Capture Point Method:</strong> We’re working on making the “Capture the Flag” mode feel more classic. Players will no longer be forced to spend excessive time capturing a flag.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Point Names: </strong>We'll assign point names — A, B, and C — to make it easier for players to navigate the map and communicate with each other.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Enemy visualization in TDM:</strong> We're addressing visibility issues by adding a special type of visualization for enemies (NPCs and players) that makes them stand out against the environment. We're also adjusting lighting components that interfere with visibility.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Player movement:</strong> We’ll work on fixing player movement desynchronization, which can cause noticeable "jitter" in the movement of enemies and allies.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit registration:</strong> The netcode is still being fine-tuned. It’s not fully polished yet, which may cause hits not to register or kills/deaths to happen much faster than intended.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit collision:</strong> We’ll improve hitbox accuracy on certain environmental objects. We tried to identify as many of these issues as possible before the test, but some may still remain in certain areas of the map.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Balance: </strong>We’ve gathered all the current feedback on PvP weapon balance and will make additional adjustments in the near future.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, though, the game generally felt rough during the Steam Next Fest demo. As someone who has been looking forward to Pioner for a while (you might have guessed it from the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a> I previously conducted with GFA Games), I think it could use some additional time in the oven to improve its polish. Still, maybe there was a big improvement in the last four months, so let's check this new build first. Meanwhile, check out the new gameplay trailer embedded above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher is set to begin its fourth and second-last season this coming October 30, 2025, the streaming company has announced, with Liam Hemsworth in Geralt's boots after Henry Cavill left the show. Alongside the <a href="https://x.com/witchernetflix/status/1967075836911030453">premiere date announcement</a>, Netflix also debuted the first proper clip of Hemsworth in the role.</p>



<p>While Cavill got the show going, and Netflix's adaptation is certainly part of what helped get the momentum going in what can now be called a renaissance for videogame to TV and film adaptations, it'll be up to Hemsworth to close out the show as he helms its final two seasons, which were shot all together so once filming ended, Netflix just had to put it together.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As a </em><em>Witcher</em> fan, I’m over the moon about the opportunity to play Geralt of Rivia," Hemsworth said, per a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth">a blog post from Netflix's Tudum website</a>.</p>



<p>Like other streamers, Netflix has added other videogame adaptations since it helped kick things off with The Witcher. It currently has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed</a> show in the works, and on the animated front, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-confirmed/">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is coming back with a second season.</p>



<p>Henry Cavill also isn't done with videogame adaptations, as he's ecstatically working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer adaptation</a>.</p>
