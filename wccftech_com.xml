			<p>Santa Ragione, the Italian indie studio co-founded by Pietro Righi Riva and responsible for beloved indies like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916350/Saturnalia/">Saturnalia</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/?curator_clanid=6876205">Mediterranea Inferno</a>, is about to launch its latest title, Horses, on the Epic Games Store, GOG, the Humble Store, and Itch.io. It's not, however, coming to Steam, and for that reason, Horses might be Santa Ragione's last game.</p>



<p>That's not because Santa Ragione doesn't want to release it on Steam. It very much so does, and submitted the game well within the appropriate time frame. The problem is, as Pietro Righi Riva explains in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, that Horses has been banned from Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>After review, we will not be able to ship your game Horses on Steam</em>," an automated message received by Santa Ragione reads, which was shared in the interview and <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">on the game's website</a>. "<em></em><em>While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won’t distribute. Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation—even in a subtle way that could be defined as a ‘grey area’—it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted</em>."</p>

<p>Valve has fallen entirely silent to Riva, and has not explained what scenes in the game it has an issue with. Riva also explained that when he first submitted Horses to Valve for approval, Valve requested that Riva send them a full build of the game so they could play through it in its entirety. Not only is this a rare occurrence, but at the time, the game was only half finished, meaning Riva had to rush to submit an unfinished version of the game that could, at the very least, allow Valve to play through an incomplete version of the final game.</p>



<p>Which is where Santa Ragione believes the ban came from. "<em>We think that the ban may have been triggered during the initial Steam submission by an incomplete scene on day six, in which a man and his young daughter visit the farm...What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag</em>."</p>



<p>Santa Ragione clarifies that the scene was changed since the initial submission, which was, again, an unfinished version of the game. It now depicts an adult woman in her twenties rather than a young girl, both "<em>to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character.</em>"</p>



<p>With the ban being permanent, and Santa Ragione likely unable to recoup the development costs of Horses without the game being available on Steam, it's likely that the studio will close after Horses is released, barring Horses becoming the best-selling game on other digital storefronts.</p>



<p>"<em>I don't want to make a final decision before seeing how the game does on launch. But if things go the way that I expect them to go, then I think [studio's closure] is inevitable</em>," said Riva in the interview. "<em>All the money we'll earn is gonna go to the author and to the people who have offered money to finish the project. So there will likely be no money left to make a new [game]… Unless a miracle happens and Horses does very well</em>."</p>



<p>Riva continued, "<em>It's always been meaningful seeing that our games resonated with people. We've always known that we never made a game that had mass appeal. So everyone who connected with our games, I feel personally connected to in a profound way. And if this is the last game that we get to make, I would tell them not to be sad, because it [is a game that] can stand on its own</em>."</p>



<p>Horses will release on PC on GOG, the Humble Store, the Epic Games Store, and Itch.io on December 2, 2025.</p>

			<p>A recent Windows Update, identified by the code KB5066835, has indeed caused substantial performance drops in PC games.</p>



<p>A few days ago, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-hotfix-driver-resolves-lower-performance-bug-windows-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new GeForce hotfix driver, version 581.94, following reports from several gamers of lower performance in some titles. Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/proof-that-recent-windows-update-harms-gaming-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has looked into the issue</a> and verified that, without the hotfix and with the aforementioned Windows Update, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows takes a major frame rate hit. In Digital Foundry's test, the game ran between 33% and 50% worse on a PC equipped with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU after installing that Windows Update. The GeForce hotfix resolves the situation, so you should definitely install it if you are currently playing the game. Another option would be to remove the Windows Update, but the existence of the hotfix makes this redundant.</p>



<p>Anyway, we have sent an inquiry to Microsoft to understand what happened here. It's not the first time a Windows Update creates issues in games, but to this extent, it is perhaps unheard of.</p>

<p>In other news, Assassin's Creed Shadows just received its 1.1.6 Title Update. It introduces a special collaboration with the Attack on Titan franchise, featuring a new time-limited quest that will only be available through December 22. Alongside the story quest, an Attack on Titan Dual Pack is also available for purchase from the in-game store. Drawing inspiration from the Attack on Titan universe, this pack will include outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A new regular side quest called A Puzzlement is also available. In this mission, protagonists Naoe and Yasuke will each learn a move from the other. Naoe will learn how to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke's war kick ability, while Yasuke will learn how to dispatch enemies in a non-lethal, stealthy way.</p>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows, which Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently confirmed</a> has performed well so far, will launch next week on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>KO_OP, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/goodbye-volcano-high/">2023's Goodbye Volcano High</a>, has just revealed and released its latest game, Young Suns. The new title is an early access release that's been shadow-dropped on Xbox Game Pass as a Game Preview title, though it'll arrive on other platforms at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Like Goodbye Volcano High before it, Young Suns is a narrative-driven game, though this time it is a 1-4 player narrative sim that takes place in space, in a distant future where you step into the space boots of Sundog, one of the last remaining ship owners following a revolt that drove back a predatory corporation.</p>



<p>Now, with the people of Jupiter recently freed, you have to step up to try and build the better world they all just got done fighting for, and meet the 30 "<em>full realized</em>" characters to learn what problems they're dealing with and how you can help them.</p>

<p>On the game's <a href="https://www.youngsuns.com/roadmap">official website</a>, on its roadmap, KO_OP says it'll focus on new features like character and friendship tracking, an overhaul of the workbench, new cosmetic items like clothing and furniture, and, of course, bug and balance fixes. </p>



<p>Releases on new platforms like Steam, which is currently the only other platform we know it'll be coming to, as there's no word on a PlayStation or Nintendo release, are left for the "<em>In the future"</em> section of the roadmap.</p>



<p>Ahead of that, even more features, like introducing wildlife on the planets you explore, mini games, new story quests, and a photo mode, are currently planned to arrive shortly after the initial friendship tracking and workbench updates.</p>
