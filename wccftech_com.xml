<p>While it remains to be seen if any game launching this year, such as the highly anticipated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marvel's Wolverine</em></strong>, will take full advantage of the system's power, by March<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">,</strong> the system is reportedly getting a much-welcome upgrade that promises to deliver significant image quality and performance improvements, and a few surprises.</p>

The user revealed when the new version of the upscaler will launch, how it will improve the performance of certain games, and more, as summarized below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Update will be available between <strong>January and March</strong>.</li>



<li>Features similar to <strong><em>FSR 4</em></strong> will be implemented on <strong><em>PS5 Pro</em></strong>.</li>



<li>Improved image quality and performance.</li>



<li>Increased frame rates for games that previously sat at <strong>70-80 FPS</strong>.</li>



<li>Higher resolution for classic low-resolution games.</li>



<li>New debugging tools will also be available for developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Particularly interesting is also the fact that classic low-resolution games will run at higher resolutions, which could make classic games on the&nbsp;PlayStation Store&nbsp;and&nbsp;more expensive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Plus</em></strong> subscriptions more enticing.</p>

			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> laid off <strong>9,000+</strong> people across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The layoffs saw studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>The Initiative</strong> entirely shut down</a>, while others like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a></strong> were hit by major cuts and project cancellations. At the time of the layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">former and current ZeniMax workers aptly called the cuts "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>,"</a> so it's uplifting to see yet another studio rise up out of these cuts, as former ZeniMax developers have come together to form a new studio, <strong><a href="https://ironrootgames.com/">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ironroot Games is the second studio to specifically come from former ZeniMax Online workers, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/"><strong>Sackbird Studios</strong> was formed in October 2025</a>. The news of the new team comes from an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-zenimax-online-devs-form-ironroot-games-following-traumatising-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where Ironroot Games' chief executive officer and creative director, <strong>Quentin Cobb</strong>, says he is still trying to work through what happened at ZeniMax Online, where he was the studio's principal gameplay designer. Cobb also goes as far as to add the word "<em>traumatic</em>"  to the list of ways to describe the cuts at ZeniMax and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I thought it was going well, personally, and it was shaping up,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>A thing that I struggle with is you wrap your identity up into your work. It's tough for that to get flushed down the toilet. I was there for almost five years. It's gone. All gone. It was a shock, and, to be honest, extremely traumatic</em>. <em>There are a lot of people still struggling with the ramifications of what happened that day. Blindsided is an understatement, that's for sure. It was a tough day, something that I'll never forget.</em>"</p>



<p>It's then no surprise that, after an experience like that, Cobb and fellow founding member, <strong>Elaine Gómez</strong>, who also acts as Ironroot Games' principal gameplay designer and studio culture leader, wanted to create their own space to try and avoid going through something like that again. Gómez is one of the few members of Ironroot who doesn't come from ZeniMax layoffs, but instead has their own self-described "<em>traumatizing</em>" triple-A layoff story from their time at <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/">former NetEase-backed studio, <strong>Worlds Untold</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We didn't see it coming,</em>" Gómez begins. "<em>We were told we were fully funded for the entirety of the number of years that this project was going to be on.</em> <em>We were doing great. We passed our prototype flags with flying colours. Everybody was happy with our work. And then all of a sudden it was like, right before Thanksgiving, 2024, 'Hey, everybody, we're just gonna rip the band-aid off</em>."</p>



<p>Moving forward, part of how Cobb and Gómez are trying to build a better future for themselves and their coworkers starts with Ironroot's foundation as a <strong>developer-owned</strong>, "<em><strong>people-first</strong>"</em> studio. "<em>You're not just a cog in a machine</em>," Gómez says. </p>



<p>"<em>The CEO or the top few people in the team taking a gigantic portion of the revenue, and the team getting scraps, is common practice in corporate America and it's disheartening</em>," Cobb said when discussing how he intends to be incredibly transparent when it comes to how the team is paid and the studio's revenue-sharing structure. "<em>I really feel very strongly that the people who make the game should earn the money that the game makes, period</em>."</p>



<p>As for what the studio is working on, Cobb and Gómez are keeping that under wraps for now. "<em>I'm dying to talk about it,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>But it's just so early now that I don't want to put too many details out there and then have to backtrack or change things.</em>" What they would say is that it is a "<em>personal</em>" game with a small budget.</p>



<p>While work on that first project may be a bit slower due to the studio being a small team and starting with some of its members, like Gómez, only working part-time to begin, it is heartening to see another team come up out of the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry over the last few years. Hopefully, studios like Ironroot Games and Sackbird Studios can help create a better future for the industry.</p>
