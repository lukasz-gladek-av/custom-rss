			<p>The successful release of Monster Hunter Wilds and the strong sales of other titles, including previous entries in the series, have driven another record year for CAPCOM.</p>
<p>In new <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/result/2024/full/4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents</a> shared today presenting the financial results of the fiscal year ending March 31st, the Japanese publisher reported 169,604 million net sales and 65,777 million yen operating income, an increase of 11.3% and 15.2% respectively, over the previous fiscal year. The Digital Contents Business, the publisher's video game business, recorded 51.87 million units sold, over 5 million units more than the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The excellent results of CAPCOM's Digital Content Business were mostly driven by Monster Hunter Wilds, which managed to ship 10 million units in just one month of availability. Other games by the publisher have contributed to the strong sales in the fiscal year, including solid sales of past entries in the series, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which have brought the total units shipped worldwide to over 100 million units.</p>
<p>Though no major release in the vein of Monster Hunter Wilds has been announced to date, CAPCOM is expecting FY2026 to be another record year with net sales expected to exceed 190,000 million yen and operating income 73,000 million yen, a 12% and 11% increase over the previous fiscal year. As this year's lineup at the time of writing only consists of remasters and ports, with only <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-will-last-20-hours-and-wont-be-open-world-says-capcom/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> being the only new game scheduled for 2026, there's a very good chance there will be some surprises launching before March 31st, 2026.</p>
<p>Though low difficulty and performance issues impact the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds' success is completely deserved, thanks to its open-world approach that makes the typical gameplay loop even more engaging. You can learn more about the game now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

<p>Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, teased 'big things' for the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em></p>
<p>Less than two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Sergiy Oganesyan on The Sinking City 2. The sequel was funded through Kickstarter with $627K in pledges, which was 450% of the minimum target set by Frogwares. As a reminder, The Sinking City 2 will be a full-fledged survival horror game with greater emphasis on combat. However, Frogwares plans to maintain the investigation mechanics as an optional bonus feature that will make life in the game easier for those who choose to engage with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silver Studio and Elementa have unveiled a new free-to-play open world gacha game called Silver Palace. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game features a rather refreshing Victorian era-inspired setting, albeit still with the anime-like art style we've previously seen in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-will-soon-require-age-verification-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a>. The game is being developed for PC, console, and mobile devices, and the combination of the reveal trailer and 10-plus-minute-long gameplay showcase has already shown quite a bit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Trailer | The Golden Age of Detectives" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELC4r7fbKEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, Silver Studio also shared a detailed overview of the features and content:</p>
<p><em>Silver Palace is a brand-new ARPG set in a prosperous metropolis with a Victorian aesthetic. It features an engaging story, a delicate art style, distinctive characters, and a dynamic, action-oriented combat system. Players will play the role of a “Detective” and embark on an adventure with a diverse group of partners to defeat the unknown enemies and unravel the mysteries in Silvernia, an industrialized metropolis built on the power of Silverium.</em></p>
<p><em>The discovery of Silverium was the key to Silvernia’s industrialization. This revolutionary element transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation. The city became a hub of miracles, driven by the massive industrialization and monetization of Silverlum under the city’s administration.</em></p>
<p><em>In Silver Palace, players assume the role of a “Detective” tasked with investigating crimes and uncovering hidden truths. As various factions—from corporate monopolies and underground syndicates to royal affiliates and cults – vie for control of Silverium, tensions rise across the city.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can switch between characters in real time to unleash powerful skills and chain QTE combos. As they explore the city’s sprawling environments, they’ll dive into the scenes of crime, hunt for clues in the shadow, battle their enemies and in the process reveal more of the stories of Silvernia.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIUa74hDJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-registration for PC and mobile devices (which will likely launch before consoles, as usual with these games) can be submitted <a href="https://silverpalace.elementagames.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official game website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5-6-seasons-says-lead-cast-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that lead cast actor Aaron Moten expects the Amazon Prime Video Fallout TV series to last five or six seasons, based on conversations with the showrunners. A few hours later, Amazon officially renewed the show for a third season, while also announcing that the second season will air on Prime Video this December.</p>
<p>Vernon Sanders, global head of television at Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout. Jonah Nolan, Lisa Joy, Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Graham Wagner have done an exceptional job bringing this beloved video game franchise to vivid life on Prime Video. Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and Bethesda Softworks, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of Season Two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy stated:</p>
<p><em>The holidays came a little early this year – we are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season of Fallout. On behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners Geneva and Graham, and our partners at Bethesda, we’re grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.</em></p>
<p>Showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner added:</p>
<p><em>We’re so grateful to have survived the apocalypse for another season! Thanks to the incredible team — our whole cast and crew, Kilter, and Amazon.</em></p>
<p>The news came at Amazon Prime Video's Upfront presentation, which was held yesterday at New York’s Beacon Theater. As befitting such an announcement, we also got a season two teaser that you can see below, providing us with the first look at New Vegas in the Fallout TV series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu5EN8V35JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Fallout TV series takes place around fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, and the showrunners have already clarified that fans of the game will see a much-changed location. Still, there's little doubt that the debut of season two will once again see the fan-favorite game skyrocket up the most-played charts.</p>
