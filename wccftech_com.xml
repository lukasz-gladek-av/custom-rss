			<p>The next title developed by Hazelight Studios has leaked online from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, who has said that the next game is called Split Fiction and is due out on March 6, 2025, on PC and console. Of course, this is just a leak for now, so we don't know whether it is true or not, and you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. It's said that a reveal trailer for the game is supposed to be released this month and that the game will be announced at The Game Awards, which will be taking place next week.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios has Josef Fares at the helm, the designer of A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and It Takes Two. All of these games are published under EA's Originals banner. Split Fiction has the potential to be great, as all three of those games have won awards, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-it-takes-two-2022-bafta-games-awards-nominations/">It Takes Two</a> winning the most out of the three and being nominated for many more. With that in mind, it's a fair assumption to feel that Split Fiction will equally be full of promise.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is apparently another co-op adventure game being made by Hazelight, which, considering the games that both Hazelight and Josef Fares have worked on, it makes total sense that this is the direction they would go with, especially with the wide success of It Takes Two.</p>
<p>It is known that Hazelight Studios has been working on a new game, as both the Hazelight Studios and Josef Fares social media accounts posted about the upcoming title, confirming that a game was in development. Josef Fares even goes on to post, "Here is a tease. It is a BRAND NEW IP called S**** ******N. Can't wait to show it soon." Considering the number of letters censored and what it begins and starts with, it seems that billbil-kun is right on the money about the title of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have more details than that, and you'll have to wait and see if the upcoming title Split Fiction is announced by Hazelight Studios at The Game Awards, which is only a week away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that the Guillemot family and Tencent were planning a buyout of Ubisoft, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the company's shareholders are still discussing buyout terms. One of the key issues is that the Guillemot family wants to maintain control over Ubisoft following the buyout.</p>
<p>Chinese giant Tencent is already the second-largest shareholder. However, despite earlier rumors, Reuters says they haven't decided yet whether to increase their stake and, therefore, join the buyout proposal. Tencent would like to exert greater control on board decisions (such as the distribution of cash flow) if it has to finance the deal, but the Guillemots haven't agreed to that yet. At the same time, Tencent also seeks to prevent any takeover of the company from third parties. As such, their strategy is reportedly to wait and see if the Guillemot family will sign on the proposal.</p>
<p>An Ubisoft spokesperson has released the following statement to accompany Reuters' article:</p>
<p><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like the Guillemots will have to give up on their long-standing goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-confirms-avatar-mario-rabbids-and-skull-bones-for-fy-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping Ubisoft independent</a>. As you may recall, it's not the first time they had trouble with that, as Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover a few years ago. They were ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-and-vivendi-the-cutain-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsuccessful</a>, and Ubisoft enjoyed a brief reprieve.</p>
<p>However, it would not last. First came the accusations of sexual misconduct, which brought their own issues for the company to face. More recently, even game launches were not as successful as planned due to commercially underwhelming games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, XDefiant (which will shut down in a few months, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> yesterday), and Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft was even forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows, losing millions of dollars to try and prevent the same fate from befalling its premiere franchise.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1562831&amp;action=edit" aria-label="“Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Marvel Rivals, Path of Exile 2 NVIDIA Game Ready Driver Now Available For Download” (Edit)">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is an impressive ray tracing showcase on Xbox Series X and even Xbox Series S, according to a new in-depth analysis shared online today.</p>
<p>In their tech review of the action-adventure title developed by MachineGames, which is now available in early access for those who purchase one of the game's special editions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the game is an impressive ray tracing showcase on both Microsoft's current-generation consoles, thanks to its main visual feature, ray-traced diffuse global illumination. This is used to calculate indirect lighting from light sources like the sun, making the lighting in pretty much every scene feel incredibly natural. In a couple of scenes shown in the video below, RTGI makes scenes with light pouring from outside look incredible, with no light bleed or gaps in the lighting. Even more impressive is how clean it looks, although there are some light image quality stability issues when moving the camera around quickly, and the fact that, on Xbox Series X, the game averages 1800p resolution and successfully targets 60 FPS gameplay. Building the lighting system of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using ray tracing was also an excellent choice for the game's setting, as Indy explores a lot of locations that have natural lighting, enhancing the experience considerably while making the whole game a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>MachineGames also managed to get the game running decently on Xbox Series S with RTGI. Unsurprisingly, some compromises had to be made, such as lowering the resolution to 1080p and below, but generally, experiencing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the system is perfectly viable, even with some image quality issues caused by a disappointing implementation of Variable Rate Shading, lower texture quality and more.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an impressive game not only for its gorgeous visuals but also for its gameplay and story, which is one of the best Indiana Jones stories ever made.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas launched as PlayStation 2 exclusives back in the day, and the deal to bring these games exclusively to the console was signed partially because Sony was worried about Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking during an EGX London special session hosted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/christopher-dring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring</a>, Chris Deering, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president up until the release of the PlayStation 3, commented on the many deals that made several third-party games PlayStation exclusives, saying that some of them, such as the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, were signed partially as a reaction to Xbox. The company was worried when they saw the console coming, and they knew exclusivity was a big deal in other fields, so, as the first Xbox launch was approaching, they spoke with some of their favorite third-party developers and publishers, asking them if they would have liked to sign a special deal to keep their next-generation games PlayStation exclusives for two years. Take-Two was among the publishers that accepted the offer, which paid off in a very big way against expectations, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grand Theft Auto</a> wasn't as big as it is nowadays, with its first top-down entries not having exactly set the world on fire.</p>
<p>Besides commenting on the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, other former Sony executives commented on other interesting facts about PlayStation's 30-year history, such as trade media skepticism of the PlayStation 2, the well-known PlayStation 3 development issues, London Studio complaining about the lack of a built-in camera for the PlayStation 4, and more. You can find more about these facts and other anecdotes <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation">here.</a></p>
