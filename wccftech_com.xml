			<p>Rob Yescombe, the writer behind films like Outside the Wire and Jackpot!, and games like <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a> and The Invisible Hours, has secured the rights for The Invisible Hours after developer Tequila Works was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">shuttered and auctioned off the rights to their IP</a>.</p>
<p>Yescombe secured the rights to The Invisible Hours in the auction, and now plans to remaster the VR game, presumably for modern headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and PS VR2, and develop a screen adaptation of it, though it's unclear if he intends to make a film or TV show of the game.</p>
<p>"<em>I adored making The Invisible Hours</em>," Yescombe said in a press release. "<em>Truly, the best creative experience of my life. Fans still reach out to me, even after all this time - they love it as much as I do. The VR hardware market has grown massively since 2017 - multiple millions of units - making The Invisible Hours a prime candidate to remaster for a new generation</em>."</p>
<p>Yescombe is currently trying to find partners to help him bring The Invisible Hours back, which, if he's successful in doing so, would be a happier ending compared to the one Tequila Works and all of the studios' titles currently have, which is the one where they were all sold at auction.</p>
<p>While he's right that the player base of VR owners is bigger than it was in 2017 when the game was first shown and in 2018 when it launched, it's still not the booming market that many developers have believed it could be. In 2025, VR has been a year away from being the next big thing for more than a decade at this point.</p>
<p>We'll see if Yescombe can find a partner and/or studio to remaster The Invisible Hours. Or at the very least, a studio willing to work on the screen adaptation, which could potentially be the more lucrative option for the murder mystery.</p>
