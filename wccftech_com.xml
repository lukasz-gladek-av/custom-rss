			<p>With the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft movie</a>, Microsoft's head of gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-would-rather-revisit-owned-ips-than-rely-on-more-licensed-games/">Phil Spencer</a>, took an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> to discuss how Microsoft and Xbox feel about navigating the future of its adaptations.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Spencer also commented quickly on what Xbox has lined up for the rest of 2025. He avoided accidentally leaking anything, but he does confirm that there are more unannounced titles beyond what Xbox has already officially announced. Along with what we do know, Spencer feels "<em>great</em>" about Xbox's 2025 lineup.</p>
<p>"<em>For us and the rest of this calendar year, I really feel great about the slate of games. We just had “Avowed” come out, and I have to go backwards and just say Obsidian continues to do a great job. We’ve obviously talked about “The Outer Worlds 2,” “South of Midnight,” “Doom.” There’s more stuff, some stuff that’s unannounced and I’m walking in my head to make sure I don’t leak anything.</em>"</p>
<p>One of the games that Spencer is trying to avoid talking about is likely the one that has already leaked: the remaster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, which could be officially confirmed in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Other potential titles could be the long-rumored Gears of War and Halo Collections coming to PlayStation and possibly even Nintendo. There's been less buzz around those of late, but if Xbox continues to be as good at keeping secrets the way it's kept the Oblivion remaster a secret, we won't have to wait very long to hear more about either collection.</p>
<p>Spencer was also asked about the Nintendo Switch 2, and he said that he wants to support it and that "<em>Nintendo has been a great partner."</em></p>
<p>"<em>We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren’t PC players, who aren’t players on Xbox...I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.</em>"</p>
<p>Speaking of Xbox's future, the platform's next big date will be its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">upcoming June showcase</a>. After that, we'll have a better idea of what 2025 looks like for Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mario Kart World Direct Airs Tomorrow, Will Be A 15-Minute In-Depth Look At The New Open-World Kart Racer]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-will-be-a-15-minute-in-depth-look-at-the-new-open-world-kart-racer.1165728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo will live stream its Mario Kart World Direct tomorrow morning, <strong>April 17, 2025</strong>, at <strong>6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The direct was announced when Nintendo first showcased Mario Kart World during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> at the beginning of the month as the next chance we'd get to learn more about it. With the live stream placeholder now up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, we know that it will only be a 15-minute presentation in which Nintendo says we'll get an "<em>in-depth</em>" look at the new kart racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo shows in this direct, but, of course, we've seen a lot about Mario Kart World since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this month. A big part of the conversation has been around the fact that Mario Kart World is one of the few Nintendo Switch 2 games that will cost $80.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World is worth the increased price.</a> Bowser even highlighted tomorrow's direct, telling players with doubts to tune in and see what Nintendo shows off.</p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to</em> <em>discover</em>." Bowser told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fmario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fswitch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=a8794423f20c06ce869d8877c3daa0d3&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">IGN</a>. "<em>And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.</em>"</p>
<p>Wccftech's own Nathan Birch had the chance to play Mario Kart World during a recent Nintendo event, and while he admits to having fun with the game, it also didn't blow him away. That said, there's still a lot of potential that can't be seen in a short 20-minute demo. We'll see how much tomorrow's 15-minute direct adds to that.</p>
<p>"<em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times."</em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Birch wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em>"</p>
