			<p>In February 2024, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games to create a persistent universe within Fortnite based on its own franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and more.</p>



<p>We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> a bit about that project from Epic Games Executive Vice President Saxs Persson:</p>



<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>



<p>Now, though, the Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.tovima.com/wsj/is-it-still-disney-magic-if-its-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> that cites anonymous sources within Epic who allegedly are disgruntled with the speed of the collaboration. According to the report, the project is codenamed Bulldog, but it is being slowed down by Disney's requirement for signoffs 'from so many divisions' before proceeding. </p>



<p>However, Epic founder and president Tim Sweeney has countered this claim. Posting on X, he set the record straight on the matter:</p>



<p><em>The anonymous quote is BS. The speed of Disney and Epic collaborations like Darth Vader has been awesome and is around 10x the ordinary speed of media company dealings in this business. We even provided a statement to the writer of this article saying so, but they chose not to print it.</em></p>



<p>Sweeney did not, however, appear to counter the report's claim that the Fortnite x Disney project is targeting a Fall 2026 release window 'at the earliest'. </p>
