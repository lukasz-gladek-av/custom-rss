			<p>When the announcement was made that a<a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/"> Death Stranding film</a> adaptation was in the works, fans immediately assumed that Hideo Kojima would direct the film and potentially even pen the script. Kojima's well-known love for movies and cinema had everyone assuming he'd be in the driver's seat for the adaptation.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though, as Kojima explicitly said at <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">2024's Tokyo Game Show</a> that he absolutely does not have time to direct the movie himself. He also explained that because he had originally viewed the story of Death Stranding as a game, it wasn't in his interest to "<em>look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective.</em>"</p>
<p>That is why the search for a director would go beyond Kojima, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a> reported on Monday, the search is over. Michael Sarnoski, the director of A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig, has been chosen to write and direct the Death Stranding film adaptation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the adaptation will "<em>delve into the mysteries surrounding the 'Death Stranding' - a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.</em>"</p>
<p>It's been more than two years since the film adaptation of Death Stranding was announced, and now that the project has a writer and director confirmed, it'll likely be another two years at least, before we can expect to see any news regarding a release date.</p>
<p>Sarnoski also won't be jumping on the project until he's wrapped up post-production work on his next upcoming film, Death of Robin Hood, which is also being produced by A24. At least now we know that real work on the project can move forward with Sarnoski officially at the helm. The next big question is whether the star-studded cast from the game will return for the film.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima Productions is currently finishing its work on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 26</a> for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-missing-a-few-big-features-fans-were-hoping-for/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is definitely a feature-rich console, with improvements over the original that will make hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of players want to buy the console on day one.</p>
<p>That's not to say the Nintendo Switch 2 will have everything players hoped for. Namely, there are three big features that we now know the Nintendo Switch 2 will be missing that players were hoping for. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/category/news/">VGC</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 will not feature Hall-Effect sticks in the new Joy-Con 2 controllers. There will also be no console-wide achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2. Lastly, the Nintendo eShop will seemingly remain without life and personality, as Nintendo confirms the iconic eShop music from the Wii days is not coming back.</p>
<p><span>Going from least to most impactful, regarding the eShop's lack of music, the producer on the Nintendo Switch 2, Kouichi Kawamoto, explained to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> that the reason comes down to games on the eShop now having videos to go along with the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games. We didn't want to intrude on that, so we don't have music there."</em></p>
<p>Next, regarding the lack of achievements, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen offered no explanation as to why they aren't there, and instead just confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements">Polygon</a>, when asked if there would be achievements, "<em>Nope</em>."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the lack of Hall-Effect sticks,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a> confirmed that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not feature them. Senior Vice President of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff gave the final word.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They're not Hall-Effect sticks, but they feel really good."</em></p>
<p>So the threat of stick drift remains for the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which are, like everything else about this new console, more expensive than the original Switch controllers. This also confirms that the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">rumor</a> that the Joy-Con 2 controllers would feature Hall-Effect sticks was false.</p>

			<p>Exciting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct was last week, even as it ended on a high note with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay-shows-how-its-more-than-just-a-dk-version-of-super-mario-odyssey/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, fans remained cautiously enthusiastic. We all recognized that Nintendo had left out the price of everything from the direct.</p>
<p>There was no price for the Nintendo Switch 2 or the games, which made even more sense when we found out, shortly after the direct was over, how expensive the Switch 2 was and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like Mario Kart World would be jumping up to $80 USD</a>.</p>
<p>But before we even get into how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">tariffs</a> could further change the pricing of the hardware and the games, Nintendo feels that Mario Kart World and every other Nintendo Switch 2 game that will cost $80 are worth that price point.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">IGN</a>, Nintendo of America vice president of product and player experience Bill Trinen discussed how Nintendo arrived at its new pricing structure and was adamant that Mario Kart World, the Nintendo Switch 2, and everything else that Nintendo reveals that now costs more are justified in that price.</p>
<p>"<em>I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, [...] I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out."</em></p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had."</em></p>
<p>Trinen's answer about the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom being $80, or the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Party Jamboree also being $80, followed the same line of thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?'"</em></p>
<p>"<em>[...] I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that."</em></p>
<p>As a senior executive at Nintendo, Trinen is expected to defend the price hikes. Ultimately, everyone buying or not buying a Nintendo Switch 2 and any of the exclusive games for it will make that judgment for themselves.</p>
<p>And who knows, Trinen could end up being right in many players' eyes. We'll have to see how the upcoming Mario Kart World Direct fares with fans and if what's revealed there really showcases why it is worth the $80 price tag.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rumors Of A Fornite Movie In The Works Are “False,” According To Epic Games Boss]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-%E2%80%9Cfalse-%E2%80%9D-according-to-epic-games-boss.1157367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chief executive officer and head of Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-says-apple-and-google-run-gangster-style-businesses/">Tim Sweeney</a> has taken to X to shut down rumors about an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2-goes-live-bringing-back-tilted-towers/">Fortnite</a> movie.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/epic-games-boss-shuts-down-fortnite-movie-rumours-1525313/">GameReactor</a>, film insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK">DanielRPK</a> claimed that the idea of a Fortnite film had been floating around Hollywood but was unable to find a studio willing to take it on to start actually developing it. Which isn't all that surprising to hear if that was the case.</p>
<p>Fortnite is incredibly popular, but not for any narrative through-line. Epic has been able to keep going since its inception. Also, the inclusion of pretty much every character from the majority of the current popular intellectual properties across genres would make the film a logistical nightmare, should any proposed Fortnite film try to capture that aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the recent box office success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> had DanielRPK speculating that studios would change their tune. Minecraft has about the same amount of narrative to it that Fortnite does, and even though it's been critically panned, the power kids have over their parents' spending money remains undefeated.</p>
<p><span>Families continue to flock to the theater to see it, though a now-viral&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'chicken jockey'</a> moment suggests that those same parents ought to bring earplugs with them to the theater if they want to keep the use of their ears after they walk out. </span>Regardless, it doesn't seem like that's a rabbit hole worth jumping down, as Sweeney simply replied to DanielRPK's claims with the word <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632">"<em>false</em>."</a> DanielRPK later deleted his post.</p>
<p>Sweeney's dismissal of DanielRPK's claims does seem to end the conversation right there, but his one-word reply also leaves a bit of ambiguity as to what he's dismissing. Is he dismissing that a Fortnite movie was ever being shopped around? Is he dismissing that the movie was being reconsidered after the success of the Minecraft film? Is he dismissing all of DanielRPK's claims because a Fortnite movie is already in development and is entirely separate from DanielRPK's speculation?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the simplest answer, he's just dismissing all of the above, and there is no Fortnite movie. Which, again, is not an unreasonable thing to suspect, because of how difficult it would be to navigate making that movie. Even in today's renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations (with a new box office record <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just broken</a> by A Minecraft Movie), there remain plenty of games that would simply not translate to the silver or small screen in a way that anyone would want. Including some of gaming's biggest franchises, like Fortnite.</p>
