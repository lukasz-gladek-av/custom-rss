			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled)</a>, Ubisoft cancelled an Assassin's Creed game in 2024 that would have been set in the 19th century, specifically in a post-American Civil War era setting. Players would have taken on the role of a Black man who had been enslaved in the American South before the war, now living in the western regions of the country, looking to start a new life.</p>



<p>That is, until you would have been recruited by the Order of Assassins and sent back to the American South to face a growing Templar threat, which would have, according to Totilo's report, seen your character "<em>confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo's report comes from a mix of five current and former Ubisoft employees who all spoke under anonymity, who claim that the game was cancelled for two main reasons.</p>



<p>The first was Ubisoft deciding it didn't want to go through the same online turmoil it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">over the inclusion of Yasuke</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows. The second reason was that Ubisoft management ultimately seemed to believe that releasing an Assassin's Creed game with this setting would have been like stepping on the third rail in the United States with regards to the game's political setting.</p>



<p>"<em>Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short</em>," a source reportedly told Game File. Another source added, "<em>I was terribly disappointed by not surprised by leadership. They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political 'status quo' and take no stand, no risk, even creative</em>."</p>



<p>This wouldn't have been the first time Ubisoft has broached atrocities like slavery in its historical settings. Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry was a spin-off to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where you play as Adéwalé, a Black man from Trinidad who was a slave before his time on Edward Kenway's ship in the Black Flag campaign. Beyond your regular Assassin's Creed stealth and action gameplay, a core element of the story was freeing other Black people who had been enslaved by the Templars.</p>



<p>In fact, you could argue that making the kind of game described by the report here would be the next logical step if you wanted to continue exploring the idea of a character fighting back against those who enslaved him and those like him.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that for all the 'backlash' Ubisoft received online for having Yasuke as one of two protagonists, Assassin's Creed Shadows had a stellar launch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-shadows/">from a critical</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/"> commercial perspective</a>, and even now <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">is still one of the best-selling games of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Ubisoft would have been able to execute on this story is another matter, but the fact that Ubisoft management allegedly deemed a story that would have, among other things, pointed out the very obvious fact that slavery is an awful, terrible, and disgusting stain on human history, "<em>too political</em>," is telling in its own way.</p>

			<p>One of the founders of the Xbox platform, Laura Fryer, published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA">a new video on her personal YouTube channel</a> to share her thoughts on the current state of Xbox, specifically Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">following the service's price hike</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">the rising costs of the consoles</a>, and she did not mince words.</p>



<p>She calls out Xbox leadership for being in a "<em>bubble</em>" and for not listening to player feedback. She called the video Microsoft published that went over the price changes to Xbox Game Pass "<em>tone-deaf</em>" and said that it is "<em>further confirmation that the bubble at Xbox is real. Leadership doesn't understand what made them great. That 'yes man' culture that took over in 2008 has only gotten worse, and this is the result. A crazy price increase for their fans, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">after announcing that Game Pass had made $5 billion</a>.</em>"</p>



<p>"...<em>With these price hikes, it feels like a betrayal. Like greed over gaming.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fryer directly calls out what the platform has lost in recent years, elements like a dedicated console that was the anchor of the ecosystem, exclusive first-party titles "<em>that drove identity</em>," and what she called "<em>a true partnership</em>" that used to exist between Xbox and game developers.</p>



<p>"<em>Xbox wasn't created to sell hardware. It was about creating a closed loop where Xbox owned the customer relationship and the developer relationship. It was bigger than just one product.</em>"</p>



<p>She continues to say there is "<em>no reason to stay</em>" within the Xbox ecosystem, saying, "'<em>This is an Xbox' is destroying all of the brand value built over the years. It was meant to be an inclusive message where everyone is welcome, but it ended up hollowing out the brand, because if everything is an Xbox, then nothing really is</em>."</p>



<p>Before the video's conclusion, Fryer admits that she can understand the business reasons pushing the platform away from consoles and hardware and towards services like Game Pass, but stands firm that current leadership doesn't understand players or game developers. She does caveat that while she was part of building the brand, she and other founding members of the team often felt like they didn't know what they were doing. </p>



<p>It's from that perspective that she calls the current leadership "<em>incompetent</em>" and says that all of these poor decisions could come down to Xbox's leaders just "<em>trying things</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I can't say for sure where this is headed. It appears that Xbox is moving towards Cloud Gaming and away from hardware. But it also could be that they're just incompetent, that they just don't understand what they're doing, and they're trying things</em>."</p>



<p>It should be said that Fryer is no longer with Xbox or Microsoft, and hasn't been for some time. She also clearly seems nostalgic for a period of Xbox and the videogame industry that simply isn't coming back. But that doesn't make her points about what current Xbox leadership is doing to the brand, and what the results of these price hikes outright wrong.</p>
