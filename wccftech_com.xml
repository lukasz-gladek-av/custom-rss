			<p><span>FromSoftware has just&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its new game, Elden Ring Nightreign, has already registered over two million players on its launch day. On Steam, it has peaked at 313K concurrent players, and it could certainly get higher during the weekend.</span></p>
<p>On one hand, this is entirely unsurprising since it's the spin-off of a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 30 million copies to date (and is now getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a>, too). On the other hand, Nightreign is inevitably an experiment to some degree, and its formula wasn't exactly guaranteed to be equally attractive. Indeed, critic scores were a bit lower than usual for the Japanese studio. However, our Francesco De Meo still enjoyed his time with the game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his 9/10 review</a> published earlier this week:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

			<p>We've heard next to nothing about the Splinter Cell Remake since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">confirmed the remake was coming</a> after years of waiting for Ubisoft to even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-were-working-on-splinter-cell-comeback/">say that they are bringing the series back</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">a sly comment</a> from the managing director at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio that's leading development on the Splinter Cell Remake, amounted to Ubisoft saying they had nothing to say at the time. That was the last time we heard anything directly from Ubisoft about the coming remake.</p>
<p>Today, however, Splinter Cell was brought up again, through the company's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990">account on X</a>. The post is just a photo of Sam Fisher, not from the original 2002 game, but from 2005's Chaos Theory, captioned with emoticons making a face and a Splinter Cell hashtag.</p>
<p>The image's alt-text reads "<em><span>Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and interestingly, Ubisoft is not included in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">image showcasing the partners for this year's show</a>. Keighley also claimed that this year's show has 60+ partners, but the image and the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">website</a> only list 57. This was likely purposeful, for Ubisoft to announce its involvement in Summer Game Fest separately with a yet-to-be-announced Ubisoft Forward event sometime during the SGF weekend.</p>
<p>That's all just speculation, but with how vocal Splinter Cell fans have been about asking for a return of the series, the company has to be acutely aware of the impact even mentioning Splinter Cell has. It's not likely that Sam Fisher would show up a week ahead of SGF if Ubisoft didn't have something to show regarding the Splinter Cell Remake.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get an announcement soon that Ubisoft does have something Splinter Cell Remake-related to show.</p>
