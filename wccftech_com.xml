			<p>Blizzard invited various content creators and press members, Wccftech included, to get a brief taste of the World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha before it goes live tomorrow. In this short period of time, we were able to capture some footage of Silvermoon City and the new Housing feature, arguably two of the standout features of the upcoming expansion.</p>



<p>We also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw&amp;pp=ygURd29ybGQgb2Ygd2FyY3JhZnQ%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Dive presentation</a> in advance. This 30-minute video reveals many new details about World of Warcraft: Midnight; here's a summary of what the developers explained about the second chapter in the Worldsoul Saga.</p>



<p>The arrival of the Voidstorm—a swirling vortex of shadow—heralds the return of Xal’atath, the big bad enemy introduced in The War Within, now wielding the Dark Heart. Her goal is simple and rather scary: to devour the heavens and extinguish all light in the universe. The expansion centers on a desperate defense of the Sunwell, led by Lady Liadrin and Lor’themar Theron (and, of course, the players), as the forces of Light and Void clash in a battle that is more reckoning than war.</p>



<p>The Blood Elf capital of Silvermoon City has been reimagined as a shared hub for Horde and Alliance. It's also, at last, a city fully renewed by the Sunwell's light. Landmarks that Horde players have are familiar with now shine renewed, but there are also brand new areas like the Sanctum of Light and Garden of Remembrance, which offer fresh lore and exploration. The shared space includes trainers, vendors, and more. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As we were told in our Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, a third of Silvermoon City remains exclusive to the Horde, and Alliance players must remember not to get too close or they may be attacked.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Because of the Sunwell's healing outburst, the Eversong Woods, once scarred by the Scourge campaign led by Arthas Menethil on his way to become the Lich King, are now teeming with life. Eversong Woods has also been merged with the Ghostlands into a seamless, expanded zone connected to the Eastern Kingdoms. The healing energy might have revitalized the land, but it also inadvertently caused a mysterious and dangerous overgrowth known as lightbloom, which, if left unchecked, could cover the whole zone in a jungle-like environment. Quests include solving noble feuds, investigating suspicious apothecaries, and unraveling a murder mystery with Magister Umbric.</p>



<p>After they're done with this first region, players will be able to progress in World of Warcraft: Midnight in any order of their choosing. There are three main options: Zul’Aman, Harandar, or a continent-spanning storytelling experience with Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner. Once those main stories are completed, the paths converge as heroes make their way into the Voidstorm itself to face Xal’atath’s fiercest allies.</p>



<p>The fallen Amani empire seeks redemption in Zul’Aman (once a 10-man PvE raid). Players join Zul’jarra, granddaughter of Zul’jin, to reclaim sacred temples and fight deranged Void cultists. This region features fog-shrouded ruins, stormy wilds, and sky-scraping peaks. Helping the Trolls means they will, in return, aid the Sunwell's defense.<br>Harandar, a primordial jungle deep within Azeroth, is where the roots of the World Tree converge. This region is home to the Haranir, already seen in the previous expansion. They are a reclusive race now forced to join the surface war against Xal’atath. Harandar features fungal towers, moss bridges, and the Cradle—a sacred site once ruled by a nascent goddess, now vanished. The Haranir are also the next playable allied race; their racial abilities include the ability to fast-travel via the World Tree roots. Haranir characters can be Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Priests, Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Monks, and Druids (with unique forms reflecting their jungle origins).</p>



<p>As for Arator’s journey, it follows the son of High Exarch Turalyon and Void Elf Ranger Alleria Windrunner on a continent-spanning quest to search for sacred relics and strengthen the Light. Featured encounters include defending Light's Hope Chapel, cleansing Scarlet Monastery, and ultimately confronting his legacy with the Sons of Lothar at Blackrock Mountain, all of which are iconic places vanilla World of Warcraft players will recognize.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, there is the Voidstorm, a chaotic, gravity-defying zone filled with ancient Void creatures called Domanaar. Here, three huge Nexus Points fuel Xal’atath's power. Players must uncover the storm's secrets alongside the Void Elves and other champions from Azeroth.</p>



<p>When it comes to launch content, World of Warcraft: Midnight offers over ten Delves, including Parhelion Plaza (located in the Isle of Quel'Danas), Collegiate Calamity, and Shadowguard Point, and one seasonal Nemesis Delve. Each Delve has its own unique mechanics, like commanding Light artillery or navigating pocket dimensions. The War Within's Brann Bronzebeard will take a break this time so that players will be joined by a new Delve companion: Valeera Sanguinar. Like Brann, her abilities differ depending on her player-selected role of tank, DPS, or healer. When set to DPS, her Killing Spree skill damages multiple enemies at once as Valeera phases in and out of the shadows. As a healer, her Vampiric Reaping extracts the enemies' life force in the form of orbs that the players can collect to get healed. As a tank, she has an ability called 'Your First Mistake' that taunts and deals damage over time to ensure an enemy is focused on her rather than the players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The expansion also includes eight new group dungeons, such as Windrunner Spire, Magister’s Terrace, Murder Row, The Den of Nalorakk, Maisara Caverns, Blinding Vale, Voidscar Arena, and Nexus-Point Xenas. Windrunner Spire, located on the Western shore of Eversoong Woods, explores the haunted legacy of the Windrunner family. Players will have to help Lirath, the only brother to the more famous Winderunner sisters; he's a spirit who just wants his home to be free of the many restless spirits that now call it home. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight's endgame includes three raids at launch: Voidspire, the heart of Xal’atath's power, guarded by six fearsome bosses; the Dreamrift, where players will hunt an undreamt god that never should have been, and the March on Quel’danas, where players will face Belo’ren, a Void-corrupted phoenix, in this two-boss raid. </p>



<p>The expansion also adds the Prey System, an opt-in bounty hunting system led by Astalor Bloodsworn in Silvermoon City's Murder Row. Players will hunt targets like Magister Sunbreaker, High Vindicator Vureem, and Executor Kaenius, picking between three difficulty tiers: Normal, Hard, Nightmare. Higher difficulties incorporate torments to add personal afflictions like time-limited kills or lethal spirits.</p>



<p>One of the brand new things revealed today is the Arcantina, a cozy, cross-faction tavern serving as a quest hub and social space. It offers respite from the war against the Void and even access to new adventures. Blizzard said familiar characters would show up, giving quests that will send players worldwide to search for relics from the long-forgotten past.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The long-awaited Housing system will allow players full customization with interiors and exteriors. Architectural styles available at launch include Orc, Human, Blood Elf, and Night Elf. An Advanced editing mode allows rotation, scaling, and floating of décor, and many housing items can be dyed to achieve the desired look. More Housing rewards are tied to many facets of core gameplay, including achievements (even from past content exploits), crafting, vendors, and events. What's particularly interesting is that players can choose to either join a public Neighborhood or a private Neighborhood. The latter are also further split into Guild Neighborhoods, which scale to fit the Guild roster, and Charter Neighboorhods, which cap at 50 homes. The developers have even prepared Neighborhood-wide monthly Endeavors that can unlock themed decorations and community rewards. Early access to the Housing system will start on December 2 for those users who pre-ordered the expansion.</p>



<p>Demon Hunters will be able to select a new spec, Devourer, a Void-powered mid-range DPS with a summonable Void Scythe. Their abilities include Voidblade, Hungering Slash, Void Ray, and Collapsing Star. Metamorphosis and Reap mechanics allow for high burst damage. In addition, Void Elves can now be Demon Hunters, too.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight will also update the MMORPG with several quality of life, Player versus Player and user interface enhancements, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li>Transmog overhauled with slot-based looks and auto outfit swapping.</li>



<li>Apex Talents: powerful multi-point capstones in the talent trees.</li>



<li>PvP additions: Slayer’s Rise (an instanced epic battleground inspired by others like Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest) and an open world PVP area) and Training Grounds (formerly known as the brawl “Comp Stomp,” now a permanent fixture to PVP battlegrounds with Silvershard Mines and Battle for Gilneas available).</li>



<li>New player experience enhancements: fast-track to Dragonflight and lorewalking.</li>



<li>Combat assistant, cooldown manager, profession streamlining, and more.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Blizzard revealed that a physical Collector's Edition of World of Warcraft: Midnight can now be pre-ordered <a href="https://midnight.blizzard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. It features an art book, a collectible pin, a replica of the Dark Heart, and the Epic edition of the game and all its digital bonuses.</p>



<p>Renowned leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that the expansion will go live on February 26, 2026, although Blizzard did not comment on the leak and remains on a generic 2026 release window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom, the studio behind the hit survival MMO Dune: Awakening, has just announced it will layoff an undisclosed number of its staff in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while also declaring Dune: Awakening to be "<em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>."</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening launched to PC players this past June 10, 2025, and within its first month had surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">1 million copies sold</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">also being one of the most-played games in June</a>, and immediately shooting up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the highest-earning games by revenue for 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It's clear, though, that a stunning launch, even the biggest and fastest-selling release in the studio's history, could not thwart layoffs. Or at least, it was clear to Funcom's bean counters and executives that it would have to reward the developers who worked hard to make Dune: Awakening the studio's biggest release ever with layoffs.</p>



<p>"<em>The game has already shown incredible potential and the right way forward is to focus our internal resources on releasing new content, features, and enhancements,</em>" the statement read per GI.Biz.</p>



<p>"<em>The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues. This difficult process is starting now, and we cannot yet determine the exact impact. We are working to find new opportunities for those affected.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Our focus now is to provide these team members with the support and guidance they need, and we as for your understanding at this time as we will not make further comments during this process</em>."</p>



<p>This news comes just off the back of Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-2-dlc-free-weekend/">releasing the first major DLC and content update</a> for Dune: Awakening, which also included a free weekend for players who had yet to jump into Arrakis to check the game out themselves.</p>



<p>The console launch mentioned above is set to come about a year after the game's PC launch, according <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/">to what Funcom told Wccftech at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>
