			<p>Tales of series remasters will be released fairly consistently in the future, according to the series producer Yusuke Tomizawa.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs4h2yfF8D4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of Series 30th Anniversary Project event</a>, the JRPG series producer talked about what's next for the series in terms of remasters, saying that Bandai Namco is planning to release remastered entries in the series fairly consistently in the future. He also added that a development line for the Remastered Project has been created to support this consistent release plan, so we should expect older entries in the series besides Tales of Graces f to become available on modern platforms in the future relatively quickly, which is great news considering how most entries in the series are stuck on previous generation consoles.</p>

<p>The next month or so is going to be a great time for fans of the Tales of series. Before the aforementioned Tales of Graces f Remastered launches on PC and consoles next month, a dedicated team called Life Bottle Production will launch its English translation patch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch/">Tales of Rebirth</a>, one of the 2D entries in the series originally launched on PlayStation 2 which will unlikely ever be remastered. This translation patch will launch later today.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Tales of Arise, which launched back in 2021 on PC and consoles. The game is a solid addition to the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of a new patch for Alan Wake 2. Version 1.27 is mainly aimed at improving the PlayStation 5 Pro support for the survival horror game.</p>
<p>When the new console launched in November, Digital Foundry <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, which performs admirably in most games, wasn't a great fit for this one due to the low internal rendering resolution. A few days later, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would take a few weeks to improve the quality of the PS5 Pro version.</p>
<p>About a month later, this new patch adds several options and improvements to Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<ul>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch is also available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, which are getting the following minor fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched on October 27, 2023 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a> and overall reception from fans. However, sales weren't equally amazing. To this day, after the release of the two planned story DLCs (Night Springs and The Lake House), the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> only 1.8 million units and still <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn't managed</a> to recoup all of the development and marketing costs.</p>
