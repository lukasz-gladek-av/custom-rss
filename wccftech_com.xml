			<p>The prices for the two ROG Xbox Ally models have leaked online, and they are surprisingly reasonable, considering what they offer.</p>



<p>As spotted by Spanish publication 3D Juegos, ASUS itself leaked the price of the two systems for Europe. The cheaper model will cost €599, around $650, while the premium, more powerful X model will cost €899, around $975. While these prices may look steep for the average user, they are in line with the other handheld PCs on the market and are in the ballpark of the price most expected. </p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally systems were rumored to be in the works for some time, and have been officially announced last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, delivering higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither of the two models will come with an<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/">&nbsp;OLED display</a>, which was ruled out by the necessity of having VRR support and balancing power draw and costs.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know when the two ROG Xbox Ally models will launch worldwide. Earlier rumors suggested the handheld systems will launch sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">October,</a> and with the prices leaking online, there's a good chance ASUS and Microsoft are gearing up for an official price and release date announcement.</p>
