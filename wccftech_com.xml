			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-gets-esrb-rating-suggesting-launch-might-be-near/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 had been rated by the ESRB. In that article, I predicted it would be released within six months, as most games rated by regulators do. Today, Paradox Interactive has unveiled that's exactly the timeframe they have in mind, as the long-awaited roleplaying game sequel is now scheduled to launch in October.</p>
<p>The message was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzc1Ow18qhY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> by Marco Behrmann, Executive Vice President of the World of Darkness IP (and Executive Producer on Bloodlines 2), who explained that the game is essentially done with only polishing left to do. Here's the full statement:</p>
<p><em>Since our last update, we have added more content to the game more narrative depth character development and we have also evolved Fabien's role in the storyline. Over the past couple of months we have invited you all to see the development of Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in the form of <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diaries</a> focusing on various areas from the game including the Camarilla, the Anarchs, the Hunters, and many many other things. I implore you to check it out, and learn more about the game. The status of the game right now is that the game is done.</em></p>
<p><em>We are currently focusing on bug fixing,&nbsp; stability and performance so that we can deliver the best experience to you guys once it releases. Bloodlines 2 will release in October this year.</em></p>
<p>It also looks like PC Gamer was the first publication to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-first-hands-on-a-gory-undead-power-fantasy-that-im-desperate-to-play-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get hands-on with a preview build of the game</a>, and their report is quite enthusiastic, minus some concerns, such as dialogue animations that need to be polished. They also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-have-typical-rpg-romantic-relationships-but-it-will-feature-romantic-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers, revealing that the game would feature 'romantic feeding' rather than relationships, as confirmed by Creative Director Alex Skidmore:</p>
<p><em>So there are some romantic options. But vampire romance isn't the same as human romance. So we have—this is probably awful and I don't want to give this soundbite—a kind of romantic feeding. So there are points with named vampires where if you have played your card rights, you can do a romantic feed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A vampire's bite in VTM is called 'the kiss', so the humans don't scream, and they're left afterwards sort of dazed, and probably when they snap out of it they'll go, 'That was awesome. Where did that person go?' So that's the romanticism, whereas we didn't have that for the combat feeds. We want the combat feeds to be lethal, horrible.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch this June, and the new system will be accompanied primarily by first-party titles, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Earlier today,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> reported that during this year's GDC, there was much talk centered on the next-generation Nintendo console, which is expected to launch this June, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">rumored</a> for a while. The most interesting reveal, however, is regarding a three-phase games launch strategy, which will begin with a first phase featuring primarily first-party titles, followed by a second phase which should begin in October and November featuring games from third-party studios that should receive a development kit in June and a third phase that will coincide with the Holiday period.</p>
<p>Up until now, we have only heard rumblings and rumors regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, so it's nice to finally hear something about games, although today's report didn't provide any information regarding which games are expected to launch together with the highly-anticipated system. Thankfully, it won't be long until we will finally see something other than a new entry in the Mario Kart series running on the system, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the new system will air next week, on April 2nd. Hopefully, the presentation will also provide some information on what is expected to launch on the system beyond its release window.</p>
