<h2>Revenge of the Savage Planet - May (PlayStation, Xbox, PC)</h2>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was well-received, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/raccoon-logic-showcases-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-featuring-co-op-modes-new-pois-several-additions/">sequel to that title</a>, bringing you back into the fun, satirical sci-fi world. You'll get to traverse alien worlds while getting gear upgrades and uncovering secrets of the worlds that you traverse. Even the trailer itself is dripping in satire and comedy. You're bound to be in for a good time with this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3 - June (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>When it comes to horror franchises, Little Nightmares is beloved by many. While it isn't particularly full of jumpscares, there are small details that make the game intense and horrifying. The third installment in the franchise is set to release in June, and this will be the first time that the franchise will have the option for full co-op throughout the game. Previously, the games were single-player, despite often telling a tale of two characters throughout the game. Make sure to put this one on your wishlist.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MainFrames - March 6 (Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>If you've been wanting to get that hit of nostalgia that comes from old PCs from the 90s, then this is a game you'll want to check out. It's an adorable little platformer set to release on March 6, where you play as a Floppy Disk and explore the ins and outs of a PC, taking you on a variety of journeys through mini-games and puzzles. It's set to be a cozy platformer, so stay tuned for the release of this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>A Webbing Journey - TBA</h2>
<p>Be warned, as this one isn't for the arachnophobes out there. However, if you've found yourself wanting to become a spider and swing around the house while building webbed structures, this is the game for you. It combines platforming, physics, and wholesome sandbox goodness. While it doesn't have a release date just yet, the game is already out on iOS and Android.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee - TBA</h2>
<p>While you could just play the original version of Yooka-Laylee as that still stands up as a fantastic game, Yooka-Replaylee will be an enhanced version of the loved platformer, adding in new challenges and content to play with, as well as new secrets to uncover. If you are a fan of Spyro the Dragon or Crash Bandicoot, you'll definitely want to check out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - February 14 (PlayStation, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox)</h2>
<p>What's a platformer without Lara Croft? For those who didn't get to experience the greatness of Tomb Raider 4 through 6, the remasters are just days away. It's set to release on Valentine's Day, so why not make it the gift to yourself, getting to see Lara in HD again? Angel of Darkness will be getting a huge revamp, and a lot of people will be playing it for the first time ever.</p>

			<p>Fallout New Vegas remains the most beloved out of all the games in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. While buggy, it featured excellent storytelling by Obsidian Entertainment, and many RPG fans believe this was their best work to date.</p>
<p>Over the years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-in-development-rumor-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors about a potential sequel</a> have only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten stronger</a>, particularly after Obsidian joined Bethesda in the Xbox family, and even more following the explosive success of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime Video. Besides, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart didn't exactly hide his fondness for the franchise. In October 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it. There's not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it's just 'Will the opportunity arise? I hung around at Interplay for probably an extra year because I wanted to work on Fallout more. I love Fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, we'll start looking into what those next games are going to be, and I would be surprised if Fallout is not on that list. If we were to do Fallout, it has to tie in with what Bethesda is doing with Fallout and a lot of other things, but I would always personally say my hope is that before I ride off into the sunset, I'd love to make another Fallout game.</em></p>
<p>Fans' hopes suddenly spiked yesterday when acclaimed game writer John Gonzalez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he had returned to Obsidian. Gonzalez is credited for his work on Tom Clancy's EndWar, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Horizon: Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. He was briefly the Narrative Director at Smilegate Barcelona and then at Fantastic Pixel Castle on their upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost MMORPG</a>. And yes, we said that he returned to Obsidian because, as you probably have guessed by now, Gonzalez was also the Lead Creative Designer and Lead Writer on Fallout New Vegas (for which he publicly thanks God on his LinkedIn page).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any hopes for a sequel were quickly dashed when he added the following under his new role as Creative Director at the studio:</p>
<p><em>Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)</em></p>
<p>So, the time hasn't come yet, despite Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly wanting to push harder on the Fallout franchise</a>. Still, given the studio and the writer, we're definitely eager to learn more about this new project in due time. For now, Obsidian is certainly focused on the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> in a couple of weeks, followed by The Outer Worlds 2, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debut this year</a>.</p>
