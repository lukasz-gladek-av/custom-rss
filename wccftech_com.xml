			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of a new patch for Alan Wake 2. Version 1.27 is mainly aimed at improving the PlayStation 5 Pro support for the survival horror game.</p>
<p>When the new console launched in November, Digital Foundry <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, which performs admirably in most games, wasn't a great fit for this one due to the low internal rendering resolution. A few days later, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would take a few weeks to improve the quality of the PS5 Pro version.</p>
<p>About a month later, this new patch adds several options and improvements to Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<ul>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch is also available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, which are getting the following minor fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched on October 27, 2023 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a> and overall reception from fans. However, sales weren't equally amazing. To this day, after the release of the two planned story DLCs (Night Springs and The Lake House), the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> only 1.8 million units and still <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn't managed</a> to recoup all of the development and marketing costs.</p>

			<p>New leaks that emerged online over the weekend have provided another look at the Nintendo Switch 2 supposed design, the system's ports, and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1heyizw/more_photos_of_the_switch_2/?share_id=9la12PrZ5fFQxo6Zaow3S&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, another Chinese manufacturer shared images of their upcoming accessories, providing a look not only at the supposed design of the system but also at details like the back stand, Joy-Con controller buttons, the top of the system, and more. While we have seen the system's design multiple times already, these images help us get a better idea of how the Nintendo Switch 2 will look, although we still do not know if this will indeed be the console's final design.</p>
<p>Another detailed look at the Nintendo Switch 2 ports also arrived during the weekend, thanks to the Chinese leaker who previously created <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">CAD models</a> of the system based on a prototype used by an accessories manufacturer, providing the first supposed look at the console. Reddit user Fidler_2k also shared the images again with details on what each port showed on the system's top and bottom could be for, and you can find them on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1heg76q/xiaohongshu_the_one_who_originally_leaked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">The number of leaks</a> that have been circulating online in the past few days is a very good indication of how players are excited about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like they aren't the only ones. According to Paul Gate, many of those who attended this year's The Game Awards after-party were very positive about the system, and some instances of confirmed dedicated support were also promising to hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My take away from The Game Awards after party regarding the successor to Nintendo Switch was VERY positive.</p>
<p>Many people that I spoke to were excited to see the system, hyped over what Nintendo’s games were going to look like next generation, or ready to play more modern…</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is doing quite well on the market, so much so that it is reportedly one of Bandai Namco's best-selling games ever.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-games-in-bandai-namco-history-a-nice-surprise-in-a-year-thats-been-kind-of-rough-overall-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Circana's executive director and games analyst Matt Piscatella revealed his surprise at how well the game is selling, highlighting how it has become not only the best-selling Dragon Ball game to date but also one of the best-selling Bandai Namco games ever. <em>"One heck of a nice surprise in a year that's been kind of rough overall,"</em> according to the analyst.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success on the market is wholly deserved, in my opinion. The game is not only a massive love letter to the franchise and an incredible tribute to the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly passed away this year, but also a very fun game to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
