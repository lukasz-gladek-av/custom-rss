			<p>A first in-engine look at the highly anticipated The Witcher IV could be coming during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation.</p>
<p>Today, CD Projekt Red confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that the studio will showcase some of the innovative technology and features that will power the next entry in the series and beyond during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation. As images, or footage, in this case, speak louder than words, there's a very good chance we will get a first in-engine look at the game to showcase some of these features better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll be coming together with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealEngine</a> to present during the State of Unreal.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to showcasing some of the innovative technology &amp; features that will power The Witcher 4, and beyond.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnrealFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnrealFest</a> — 9:30 AM ET | 3:30 PM CEST on June 3:… <a href="https://t.co/IfrdVM539I">pic.twitter.com/IfrdVM539I</a></p>
<p>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1929538495355494826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As most PC players are painfully aware, the vast majority of games powered by Unreal Engine 5 are plagued by stuttering issues, which newer versions of the engine are attempting to mitigate but seem far from completely solving. CD Projekt Red is well aware of these issues as well, as detailed in a presentation from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, so there's the possibility that some of the innovative technology to be showcased tomorrow could have something to do with addressing what has become the biggest issue in PC gaming in the past few years.</p>
<p>Though the first in-engine look at The Witcher IV may not be too far off, it will be a while until we will be able to play the game. Earlier this year, CD Projekt Red confirmed it won't launch until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">at least 2027</a>, so it will take a few years to see how the developer will manage to convince players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/">Ciri is as important as Geralt</a> in the series' universe, something that those who read the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski already know well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144">officially announced</a> that its James Bond-based game, Project 007, is officially titled 007 First Light and that a full game reveal will be coming later this week.</p>
<p>Project 007 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/">first announced back in 2020</a>, and since then, we've all been eagerly waiting to hear more about the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-bond-and-io-interactive-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-says-mgm-itll-be-special/">everyone seems to agree will be something special,</a> considering that IO Interactive is the perfect studio to make a James Bond game.</p>
<p>IO Interactive is one of the studios listed as a partner for <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, so it's easy to guess that the reveal due to come this week will be during SGF's big kick-off event this coming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hr6Q2hln_M">Friday, June 6, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">new page on IO Interactive's website</a> for 007 First Light describes the game as "<em>a wholly original Bond origin story,</em>" and that&nbsp;<em>"players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status</em>."</p>
<p>Summer Game Fest will have plenty of big announcements and reveals during its big kick-off event this Friday, but it's fair to say that the reveal of 007 First Light will likely be one of the biggest announcements across the whole week.</p>
<p>Having IO Interactive make a James Bond game is like the video game equivalent of putting peanut butter and chocolate together in the eyes of many players, and has remained one of the industry's most anticipated projects since it was revealed almost five years ago now. It'll be interesting to see what IO Interactive has been cooking with this project.</p>

			<p>The upcoming PC release of Stellar Blade is going to be accompanied by all sorts of mods, and the game's developer seems to have already embraced them fully, offering praise for a mod now available for the recently released playable demo.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1929193800133742858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1929193800133742858%7Ctwgr%5Ebf7019ef9ac22b6b565cee10c60ca44810a6777a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespark.jp%2Farticle%2F2025%2F06%2F02%2F153330.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the game's official profile recently shared a short clip showcasing a modded VR mode now available for the demo via <a href="https://github.com/praydog/UEVR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEVR</a>, praising it without reservations, leading some users to ask about the future addition of a PSVR 2 mode on PlayStation 5. Sadly, the developer has not clarified if this could be a possibility, so for the time being, the only way to play the game with a VR headset will be with the PC version launching next week. In case you do not own a VR headset, but still want to check out how Stellar Blade plays in VR mode, you can check out the video below by Paradise Decay.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Stellar Blade playable demo launched on Steam<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/"> last week</a>. The demo allows players to try out the first hour of the game as well as fight against a boss found later in the story to let players try out some of Eve's advanced abilities. Save data from the demo can also be imported into the full release, which will launch on June 12th. You can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
