			<p>Today, Marvel and NetEase revealed the launch date and details for Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens. The new season is going live on July 11, with the cosmic-powered Phoenix joining the roster as a new playable hero and the Klyntar: Celestial Husk map being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">popular</a> hero shooter game. Season 3 will also introduce new features, special events, and Team-Ups between characters. Going forward, the developers have announced that Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p>



<p>On this Mosaic (Space) Timeline, the Phoenix and Jean Grey have fully accepted each other, traveling through the universe while helping residents across the galaxy. However, when the Timestream Entanglement took place, the Phoenix sensed a terrible darkness awakening at the edge of the known universe. The Phoenix could feel that this darkness had already corrupted many gods, and even she, who was so far away, felt a sharp pain in her mind. To annihilate it in its slumber, the Phoenix and Jean decided to venture into the abyss where this darkness resided, using their flames to completely burn down the root of this universe's problem. The Phoenix will be a Duelist-type character in Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>As for the new map, lore-wise, Knull has slaughtered multiple Celestials. The severed head of the first Celestial he decapitated drifted away from the planet Klyntar over the eons, morphing into Knowhere. Meanwhile, the body has remained in orbit above Klyntar, slowly corroded by Knull's power within and the forces of the cosmos outside. The Celestial Remains fall from the sky, becoming a part of the Klyntar landscape.</p>



<p>For Season 3, the Marvel Rivals team is adding new features, battle pass and system updates and four new Team-Ups. The game's mission system will see a complete overhaul and a new layer of customization to the accessories system will be introduced. A brand-new competitive mode will be released in the latter half of Season 3, and Blade will join the roster. Also, beginning in Season 3, verified university students will enjoy costume trials. University students can access 10 costumes and MVPs upon completing verification. These costumes will rotate each season. The Marvel Rivals team is rolling out email verification for students in the US, UK, and more, with more regions to come.</p>
