			<p>THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has already sold more than 300K units in less than three days since its early access debut on PC, where the game is available via Steam or the Epic Games Store. So far, user reviews submitted on Steam are positive, with 84% of the nearly 6K reviews entered so far giving the game a thumbs up. </p>



<p>According to Grimlore Games, this version of Titan Quest II includes around 15 hours of content. The full version is expected to be available in around a year; however, once the game gets to version 1.0, the price will be raised to $49.99 / €49.99. Those who wish to join the early access can do so at a discounted price of $29.99 / €29.99, and from now through August 8, there is another 20% discount to bring the price down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>



<p>Grimlore plans to add new masteries, new content, and new world segments, stories, and quests, as well as new features to enhance the game’s longevity, such as crafting. These new features and content will be released through early access as soon as they are ready. Smaller updates, such as bug fixes, balancing, and minor polish updates, are expected to go live monthly, though they can be skipped if nothing major is needed. Major updates, adding significant new features, mechanics, and/or content, will be released roughly every three months. The studio will also introduce translations to the game during the early access period, as currently, there's only English.</p>

<p>As usual with early access games, Titan Quest II will only launch on consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X once that phase is over and version 1.0 is ready to deploy on PC.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is being added this Thursday to the game The First Descendant. Nexon's free-to-play third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing</a>, but with the official launch of Season 3 on August 7, GeForce RTX 50 Series will get even better performance thanks to Multi Frame Generation. On average, DLSS 4 runs the game 4.9x faster than native rendering. The flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 226 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (with the transformer model). The RTX 5080 registers 192 FPS under the same conditions.</p>



<p>Season 3 'Breakthrough' also sees the addition of Nell, a new playable character who wields arc-like telekinetic abilities, launching energy spheres that inflict debuffs and pull nearby enemies into her attacks. She is ideal for fast-paced, aggressive, run-and-gun players because she can convert all gunfire into weak point hits. Breakthrough will also expand the game world by adding a big new field area called "Axion" and a formidable Colossus boss battle. Lastly, Players can also look forward to a mountable vehicle, which will allow them to travel faster across the regions of The First Descendant.</p>

<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is also available (alongside DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex) in the single player survival horror puzzle Death Relives. Developed by small and independent Turkish developer Nyctophile Studios, Death Relives takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and real historical events from the 16th century. Players find themselves in a nightmarish world where they must survive against long-forgotten gods, such as Xipe Totec—the Aztec god of death, life, rebirth, agriculture, vegetation, and deadly warfare. </p>



<p>Throughout the game, they will visit historical locations, such as the ship Hernán Cortés traveled on to reach the land of the Aztecs. The dark and eerie atmosphere of Death Relives hides other entities lurking in the shadows that are revealed through the storyline as the protagonist, Adrian, progresses through the game. Death Relives launched around ten days ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1987400/Death_Relives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> and so far, most user reviews (83%) are positive.</p>
