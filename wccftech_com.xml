			<p>The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1</a> will introduce some PC-specific improvements, including a reduction of VRAM usage that should lead to better stability.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Director Yuya Tokuda shared a new message on the game's <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> providing additional information on Title Update 1 launching later this week, as well as on future additions, which include the introduction in late May of Tempered Monsters (â˜…8) Gore Magala and the apex predators Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad as well as some balance tweaks that will make them more resilient, like increased health and resistance to wounding, balance adjustments to weapons and mantles, more quality of life improvements and more.</p>
<p>The biggest news for PC players, however, is the confirmation that this week's update will introduce improvements such as a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to DirectStorage's latest version, which should result in an overall improvement in stability. In addition, the team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, so the PC version should see more improvements in the future.</p>
<p>At the end of today's message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also teased some more changes coming in the future, such as changes to the gameplay flow and the introduction of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/">Layered Weapons</a>. This will be quite welcome, as the powerful Artian weapons don't look all that good&nbsp;compared to the vast majority of other regular weapons.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game and why it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">10 million copies</a> already by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>
