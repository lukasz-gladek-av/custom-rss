			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 2020 launch, to the point where players can't wait for what CD Projekt RED has coming next in the sequel currently codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-evolve-much-like-the-witcher-games-in-cdprs-plans/">Project Orion</a>.</p>
<p>According to the creator behind the Cyberpunk series the games are based on, Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt RED will have a whole new city for players to explore, on top of the infamous Night City that players have already spent hours digging into.</p>
<p>Pondsmith revealed the second city during Digital Dragons 2025, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/">VGC</a>) saying, "<em>I'm not as involved directly, but I see the scripts. Last week I was wandering around talking to different department and seeing what they had, like 'this is new Cyberware, what do you think?' I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place...because there's another city that we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that, but there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work, it doesn't feel like Blade Runner</em>," he continued. "<em>It feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'yeah, I can see this working</em>."</p>
<p>It's exciting to consider that we'll have all of Night City, and then a whole new city, potentially even around the same size, to explore in Project Orion/whatever the final official title of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will be. But it'll be a long time before we see it, since CD Projekt RED still has to get through<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-new-saga-pre-production-witcher-remake-cyberpunk-sequel-concept/"> The Witcher 4</a> before it heads back to Cyberpunk.</p>

			<p>Developer Raccoon Logic's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> has surpassed 1 million players, the studio has announced. Nearly two weeks since the game launched, the studio celebrated the milestone, though creative director Alex Hutchinson still lamented the fact that, due to Revenge of the Savage Planet being available on subscription services, 1 million players doesn't mean 1 million sales.</p>
<p>"<em>We are super grateful to all the 1M players who have taken up revenge against Alta</em>," a statement from Raccoon Logic on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2787320/view/537728173036537047">Steam page</a> began.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for the support. On the team side, we are continuing to make fixes very regularly to ensure that everyone has the best experience possible. We're also working on a roadmap for new features/updates/etc that we want to share with you very soon! In the meantime, keep kicking brainards, raccoons, and decking out your habitat STV Cribs Style. The team loves seeing all your creations, gifs, memes, etc. Keep em' coming!</em>"</p>

<p>On X, creative director Alex Hutchinson still celebrated the milestone, but seemingly with an upset tone that the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass means it doesn't exactly reflect the financial success that 1 million players would have meant in the days before subscription services like Game Pass.</p>
<p>"<em>In the modern world it sadly doesn't mean sales with the subscription services but still an awesome milestone</em>," Hutchinson<a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1924124703427371070"> wrote on X</a> while sharing a photo celebrating 1 million players.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">review of Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, we praised the game's style and its humor, but still found it a tedious journey that cut any momentum it was starting to build at various points in the game.</p>
<p>"<em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down</em>."</p>
