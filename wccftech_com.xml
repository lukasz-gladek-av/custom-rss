			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will be among the Nintendo Switch 2 games releasing in the system's launch window that will hit the maximum resolution offered by the system's screen, according to new information.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Japanese company <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/feature/magazine_2025special/sp/index.html?page=2&amp;device=sp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the digital version of its Nintendo Magazine 2025 Special Issue focused on the new system. While most of the information included in the magazine is not new, we did get on page 12 the confirmation that Donkey Kong Bananza will run at up to 1080p resolution, 60 FPS with HDR in handheld mode. Considering launch titles usually don't take full advantage of a new system, this is definitely impressive, although a more thorough analysis will be needed to see how often the game will indeed run at 1080p and how stable the 60 FPS target will be.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza feels like a new beginning for the character and its franchise, although the game is not a reboot, given Cranky Kong's presence. Besides featuring a new design for the iconic character, the game plays a lot differently from its predecessors, as Donkey Kong can now use his fists to destroy the environment. You can learn more about how these new mechanics shape the experience in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/"> preview.</a></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-8-0-two-more-exclusives/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a variety of enhancements that should improve emulation of different games.</p>
<p>The 0.8.0 version, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.8.0">here</a>, doesn't come with any major new feature like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-7-0-amd-fsr-hdr-download/"> 0.7.0 version</a>, which introduced AMD FSR and HDR support, but it still packs a lot of technical core, libraries, GPU, shader recompiler, and GUI enhancements that should provide some welcome improvements to emulation in different games.</p>
<p>Even before the ShadPS4 0.8.0 version was released, some emulation improvements were already added to the PlayStation 4 emulator in work-in-progress versions. These improvements allow the emulator to run two additional PS4 exclusives, the racing game Driveclub and the open-world game InFAMOUS Second Son, although both games are not exactly in a playable state with visual issues and bad performance, as highlighted in the videos below shared by BrutalSam. Still, considering how Bloodborne went from barely launching on the emulator to being playable from beginning to end in just a few months, it shouldn't take too much time for the emulation of both games to improve, and allow PC players to experience two more games that are unlikely ever to get officially ported.</p>

<p>By making Bloodborne playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator opened the doors for modding projects that improved what is still one of the best games released by FromSoftware. Among these is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/"> Remaster Project by fromsoftserve</a>, which introduces visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was definitely among the success stories of the first half of 2025<span>.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It sold two million units in the first two weeks</a> and received</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread acclaim from critics</a> and users alike. However, the game took a long time to make: there was almost a seven-year gap from the first installment's release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1kpjbR1Cg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with The Game Business</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Game Director Daniel VÃ¡vra has now openly revealed that he suffered health issues from the lengthy and stressful development. He also wishes that the 'AI revolution' could accelerate game development speed, especially since he has at least a couple of ideas that he believes might find as much success as KCD.</p>
<p><em>I want to rest a little bit. It was really tough. I had some serious health issues last year from all the stress and stuff like that, so I really need to slow down a little bit. I have a lot of ideas on what to do. Time is short. It really annoys me that the games take so much time to do, because I have more ideas than I have time.</em></p>
<p><em>There are a couple of projects that I would love to do, and I would love to prepare them properly so it's not as chaotic. I hope that maybe the AI revolution will help with this, that in the future we will not be replaced by AI, but we will be helped by AI a lot, so a lot of things could get easier and faster. I hope that it will happen, and it would be great if this happened.</em></p>
<p><em>Generally, I have a couple of big ideas that I would like to make that will require a lot of time and preparation, so maybe I will focus on those. Of course, there are some DLCs for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and stuff like that, but that was already announced. In the far future, there are</em><br>
<em>still a couple of projects that I would like to do, and in my opinion, they have as much potential as KCD.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Director also praised <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parent company Embracer</a> for giving Warhorse Studios a lot of creative leeway.</p>
<p><em>Actually, Embracer had - I believe it still has - the idea that Lars Wingefors, who is the CEO, is giving the studios a lot of freedom. So, generally, we had a lot of trust and we could do basically whatever we wanted. There was almost zero outside influence on the creative decisions on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is great if it works and when you are not insane. I understand that the corporation wants to have some control over the final product when it invests a lot of money, but generally we had a lot of freedom and it worked.</em></p>
<p>The game has three premium DLCs scheduled to launch within the next few months: Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesiae.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, after largely praising the visuals and gameplay changes made by Virtuos, reviewer Francesco De Meo also noted that the performance was highly problematic:</p>
<p><em>The game runs pretty well in closed-off environments, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired in the open world. In two different benchmarking sessions, held in the sewers during The Path of Dawn quest to meet with the Sponsor to obtain the Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4 book, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode, Frame Generation Hardware Lumen and every setting at high, the game ran at an average of 141 FPS, 24 1% low, with minimal stuttering that did not impact the experience a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>In the open world, however, things are quite different, as the game ran at an average of 107 FPS, 15 1% low with frequent stuttering. My system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) should be more than capable of handling Oblivion Remastered well, at least based on the system requirements, so it's clear that more work is needed on the optimization front.</em></p>
<p>I experienced the same even on my more powerful rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5090). While the game runs smoothly in closed off areas, open areas and especially the open world are close to a stutter-fest.</p>
<p>The folks at Digital Foundry agree, too. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0rCA1vpgSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC video report</a>, published over the weekend, praised the remaster's visuals but cited 'dire performance problems'.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oblivion Remastered PC: Impressive Remastering, Dire Performance Problems" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0rCA1vpgSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia noted that history repeats itself, as constant hitches in the open world also plagued the original Oblivion. Even a lower frame rate cap to 60 FPS cannot really fix the issue. While hitches are very bad on the most powerful CPU available on the market, they're much worse on lower end CPUs. For example, the Ryzen 5 3600 exhibits 2 to 2 and a half longer hitches compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in DF's testing.</p>
<p>The only real way to slightly improve the stuttering/hitching issue is to disable hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination. Unfortunately, this also brings a noticeable reduction in visual quality, especially when it comes to water reflections, ambient shadowing and lighting. Needless to say, the only real fixes can come with an official patch from Virtuos. We'll keep you updated on any such enhancements, of course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed four million players</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-to-parry-consistently/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-%E2%80%93-how-to-parry-consistently.1175151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-to-parry-consistently/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features a lot of familiar role-playing game turn-based combat mechanics, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive twists them in some interesting ways to give players something else to do other than picking commands and watching characters carry them out. During both the offense and defensive phases, you will have to complete some straightforward quick-time events that increase the power of your attacks and completely negate damage from enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Completing these QTEs for attacks, however, is considerably easier than doing the same when defending against enemy attacks in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And significantly less important as well. While losing some damage is, ultimately, no big deal, missing a parry or a dodge often means the targeted character will eat a lot of damage, making combat feel more frustrating and considerably less fun than it actually is.</p>
<p><strong>Learning to parry and dodge consistently in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 requires you to do away with any preconception you may have regarding timing</strong>. If you're a big action game fan who has completed challenging parry-based games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you will learn straight from the first training duel against Maelle that the timing for parries in the game is very different from that of action games. Instinctively, the first few times, you will press the parry button right as the attack is about to connect with your character, but that will not work.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250427172317_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before you even attempt learning to parry in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, you should focus on <strong>dodging</strong> first. The timing for dodges is considerably less strict than for parries, thus you will be able to pull them off more easily. At the same time, dodging will give you a better feel for the correct timing, and when you start pulling off perfect dodges, you will be ready for parries, as the timing for perfect dodges is the same as parries.</p>
<p>The secret to learning how to parry consistently in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is understanding how they work. Think of parries as putting up a barrier or a shield for a few seconds. It takes some time to bring them up. As such, parries are not active from the first frame of animation and require a moment before they become active.<strong> For parries to be successful, the enemy attack has to connect with the "shield" the character puts up after pressing the parry button, so you need to take the time it takes to put it up into account.</strong></p>
<p>Judging from how parries work in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and how enemies often delay their attacks sometimes in an unnatural way, it's clear that the developer didn't intend for <strong>parries to be a defensive option that can be thrown out carelessly</strong>. Once you've got the general idea of the timing, you will need to practice a lot with each new enemy and learn which visual or sound cue can help you time the parry. Throughout the adventure, doing all this will eventually become natural, making fighting enemies in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 considerably more enjoyable.</p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive proudly <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> an important sales milestone for its debut game, the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over half a million units in the first day alone, and after three days, it has become a million-seller.&nbsp;This is particularly relevant because it's in addition to the game being available on Game Pass, which undoubtedly reduces full-game sales on PC and Xbox.&nbsp;Given that this is not a triple-A budget game, it's possible that the game could be close to breaking even.</p>
<p>Critic and user reviews so far are also excellent, with many already pitching Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Indeed, from the very announcement, the game immediately looked exciting. The blend of a fantasy setting inspired by Belle Ãpoque France with the plot twist of a seemingly all-powerful being condemning an entire year class to death was powerful. Similarly, on the gameplay side, the game mixes classic turn-based JRPG action with real-time elements powered by Quick-Time events for dodges and parries, for example. There are also renowned actors and voice actors such as Andy Serkis, Charlie Cox, Ben Starr, and Jennifer English leading their performances to the cast of main characters.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game has relatively low system requirements, but those who don't meet them can play it anyway via NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud platform. NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution is natively supported, while Frame Generation is only available via a PureDark mod <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/clair-obscur-33-127531080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released exclusively to the modder's Patreon subscribers</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech only got access to the game on launch day, so our review is still being worked on and will come later this week. Meanwhile, if you've been playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, what are your impressions so far? Let us know in the comments section.</p>
