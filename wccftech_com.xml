			<p>La Quimera is a new first-person, linear, story-focused shooter from <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">Reburn</a>, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which previously worked on the Metro series with the rest of 4A Games based in Malta.</p>
<p>It was initially set to release today, April 25, 2025. The release date was set at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">beginning of April</a>, and review codes were sent out to Wccftech and other members of the press ahead of today's launch. Shortly after reviews went live, Reburn announced within its Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/la-quimera-has-been-quietly-delayed-no-new-release-date/">DSOGaming</a>) that La Quimera was delayed, with no new release date set.</p>
<p>In a statement, chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar apologized for the last-minute delay and attributed the issues Reburn had to unexpected problems it faced with this being its first project as an independent studio and "<em>the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We'd like to apologise for the unexpected delay in getting La Quimera out to you, our fans and supporters. Our team here at Reburn has been working hard on the game, and it being our first title as an independent game developer has led to some unforeseen challenges. We are trying our best to address the matters as quickly as possible, while also navigating the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine. We thank you for your patience, your continued support, and your understanding.</em>"</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">review of La Quimera</a>, we noted plenty of bugs, which, on their own, made it abundantly clear that it needed more time in development. But the bugs weren't the only issues the game had. Core issues with the story and characters, with gameplay that only features a few cool moments, are all problems that take more than a few rounds of bug fixes to fix.</p>
<p>"<em>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image,</em>" our reviewer wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-now-set-for-may-23-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish independent developer Questline has announced the full release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a>.</p>
<p>Questline previously launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: Conquest</a>, a hybrid game mixing deck-building roguelike elements with RPG, in 2021 to positive reviews.&nbsp;This one is much more ambitious, though. It's a first-person open world roleplaying game available on Steam Early Access for two years, now set to debut version 1.0 for PC and consoles (<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-demo/9nql6tbgt1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>) on May 23.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a meaty experience that can take between 50 and 70 hours to be completed. Players will find the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three massive zones to explore:</strong>&nbsp;Horns of the South, Cuanacht, and Forlorn Swords.</li>
<li><strong>250 unique NPCs</strong>, fully voice-acted, adding depth and a personal touch to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 200 side quests</strong>, ensuring countless hours of engaging gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>More than 60 unique enemies</strong>, each presenting distinct challenges.</li>
<li><strong>70+ dungeons</strong>&nbsp;filled with secrets and dangers.</li>
<li><strong>A branching main quest</strong>&nbsp;with dozens of possible endings, offering deep replayability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting-wise, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a dark fantasy reimagining of Arthurian legends. Players will journey into the heart of Avalon, a land shaped by 600 years of Camelot’s rule, to witness the epic conclusion of this era. With their choices, they will decide the legacy of King Arthur's reign.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 will introduce the community-requested third-person view. Questline has prefaced that it won't be perfect yet, but they're adding it in anyway since many users have problems with the first-person view (such as motion sickness). At this stage, it's more of an accessibility fix. Of course, there will also be brand new Achievements to mark the players' journey throughout Avalon.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, as the developers of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon hinted that version 1.0 includes so much content that it's 'crazy' and they would have 'laughed hard' if they were told the game would end up this big. However, the full patch notes aren't available yet.</p>
<p>As a side note, the team also shared a 'golden horse armor DLC' joke as a joke reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion Remastered</a>, then added in a Steam post:</p>
<p><em>On a serious note, it is so good to see Oblivion coming back with such a style! It is one of the games that shaped us when we were kids/teens, and continues to be a huge source of inspiration. BIG congratulations to the team responsible for the remaster! We can’t wait to get back to Cyrodiil ourselves, but for now… well, we have a game to finish first! And we are honestly doing our best to deliver something unique that we hope you will remember for quite a long time.</em></p>

			<p>Sydney Sweeney is appearing in the news for video game to film adaptations for the second time this week. After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">report from Deadline</a> that Sweeney would be teaming up with Michael Bay to adapt SEGA's Out Run into a movie, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a> reports that Sweeney is now teaming up with Wicked director Jon M. Chu to adapt Hazelight's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split-Fiction</a> into a film.</p>
<p>Sweeney is slated to be an executive producer and will also star in the movie. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the same writers behind Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, will write the script.</p>
<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">previously</a> reported that a Split-Fiction movie was happening, but now we know some of the key creatives behind the project. While Sweeney will play one of the lead roles between Zoe and Mio, characters named after Hazelight Studio head Josef Fares' daughters, it's not yet decided which role Sweeney will play.</p>
<p>In the case of a game like Out Run, it isn't easy to see what shape a film adaptation of that game will take. The opposite is true for Split-Fiction, which, despite having a predictable story, is ripe for a film adaptation with plenty of opportunities for big blockbuster movie moments in its fantasy and sci-fi settings.</p>
<p>The next big questions now are who will star alongside Sweeney, how Chu will bring some of the magic he brought to Wicked to Split Fiction, and whether the story can't be punched up in a new medium with its film version.</p>
<p>So far, in the renaissance of video game adaptations to movie or TV show adaptations, we've not seen an adaptation surpass the game in terms of storytelling. Some changes have been praised, but there hasn't yet been an adaptation where we could definitively say the story is improved in the adapted version. Split-Fiction feels like the perfect candidate to break that ceiling.</p>
