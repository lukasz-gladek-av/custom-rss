			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the popular stealth series, is launching in late August on PC and consoles, according to a new finding.</p>
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/concept/10007293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Store listing</a> was updated today with an August 28th release date which is also confirmed by a<a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new trailer</a> that is currently only available on the PlayStation Store.

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is setting out to be an extremely faithful remake that will allow players to experience the epic Operation Snake Eater. Despite aiming to be a faithful recreation of the original, the remake will still come with some new features over the original, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">a new control scheme</a>, a modernization improvement that was somewhat required by the improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5. At the same time, the game features very few changes, as series producer Noriaki Okamura still wants long-time fans to feel nostalgic while playing the game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 28th worldwide.</p>
