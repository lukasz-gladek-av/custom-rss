			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>
