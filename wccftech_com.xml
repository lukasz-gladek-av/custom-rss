			<p><strong>Update 16/02/2026 6:00pm ET:</strong> Following the publication of this story, a representative from <strong>Hasbro</strong> sent this statement to Wccftech:</p>



<p>"<em>The Snake Eyes game is <strong>not cancelled</strong>. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven't been finalized, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Original Story 16/02/2026 4:43pm ET:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Atomic Arcade</strong>, the <strong>Hasbro</strong> and <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>-owned studio that was making a game based on the iconic <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> character <strong>Snake Eyes</strong>, has reportedly been <strong>shut down</strong>. The news broke from one of the former team members, gameplay programmer <strong>Dominic Braun</strong>, shared on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-activity-7429184370877345793-37wz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> that he had been laid off following "<em>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast's decision to close Atomic Arcade</em>."</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no official word from Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or Atomic Arcade confirming the closure or the fate of the Snake Eyes game. We've reached out to Hasbro for comment and will update this article if/when we hear back or if an official statement is delivered through other verified channels.</p>



<p>We first heard about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-has-a-big-budget-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-in-the-works/1100-6506502/">back in 2022,</a> with Atomic Arcade seemingly being formed for the purpose of making this Snake Eyes game. While the studio was active in sharing notices that it was looking to grow its team between 2022 and 2025, with the last major update being a sneak peek at the Snake Eyes model from Atomic Arcade back in <a href="https://x.com/AtomicArcadeStu/status/1922305837042991257">May 2025.</a></p>



<p>It's the latest studio shutdown and mass layoff of the year, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> kicked off 2026 by embarking on a "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that included multiple studio shutdowns. We've also seen layoffs from <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Meta</strong> that ended <strong>Camouflaj's</strong> award-winning run of developing VR games</a>, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/">cutting nearly half of the <strong>2XKO</strong> development team shortly</a> after the game's 1.0 release, and most notably, <strong>Highguard</strong> developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">cutting "<em>most</em>" of its team</a>, barely two weeks after Highguard launched.</p>



<p>But at least in all of those cases, the studios impacted had gotten a game across the finish line. Atomic Arcade, seemingly, did not get the same chance, and now it seems like G.I. Joe and Snake Eyes fans who have been waiting for a major release based on the iconic ninja will have to wait a while longer.</p>



<p>It's also one less game coming from Hasbro's IPs, as we know that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">currently several games from Hasbro-owned IPs on their way</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> has been one of the most controversial topics in the video game industry in recent years, and will likely continue to hold that spot for the foreseeable future. Whether you think GenAI <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">has a place</a> in game development <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">or not</a>, what's clear from game engine makers like <strong>Unity</strong> is that users who want to use it in the process of making their games will have that option.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-">GameDeveloper</a>, in Unity's <a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx">recent earnings call</a> for its fourth quarter financial report, not only does Unity claim that <strong>"<em>AI-driven authoring</em></strong>" is a "<em>major area of focus</em>" for the company, but it sees the potential of the technology being its ability to "<em>enable developers to <strong>prompt full casual games into existence</strong> with natural language only</em>."</p>



<p>The statement comes from Unity's chief executive officer, <strong>Matt Bromberg</strong>, who has been at the head of the company since taking over for the interim chief executive officer <strong>James M. Whitehurst</strong>, who took over from <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/"><strong>John Riccitiello</strong> after the company's abysmal runtime fee fiasco in 2023.</a></p>



<p>"<em>AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026,</em>" says Bromberg. "<em>At the Game Developer Conference in March, we'll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform - so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product</em>."</p>



<p>Bromberg continues, "<em>This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.</em>" </p>



<p>Bromberg would add that he believes the technology will go further in efforts to "<em>democratize</em>" game development, and "<em>remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience</em>."</p>



<p>Unity isn't the only company claiming it has GenAI technology that can make games through prompts. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/"><strong>Google's Project Genie</strong></a> (despite being a self-admitted experiment) was enough to send the share prices of major game companies plummeting. While that may have more to do with investors not understanding how video games are made and <a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">what technology like Project Genie lacks</a>, the idea of games being prompted into existence is already out there.</p>



<p>For it to now come from the company behind one of the most popular game-making engines carries far more weight than it did coming from Google, and it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how markets react when the new beta branch is revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, regardless of the stock market's reaction, it's unlikely consumers will react positively to a game that a developer admits was made entirely through prompts. Even executives pushing for GenAI technology can <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">admit that no one wants "<em>GenAI slop</em>."</a> It's difficult to believe that the ability to prompt games into being would lead to anything but more AI-slop on gaming platforms.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, while some executives in the industry might see GenAI as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">next-best thing that'll forever change the industry</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gen-ai-had-zero-part-building-grand-theft-auto-6/">biggest video games in the industry are differentiated from the rest of the pack</a> because they are handcrafted experiences. And that's without getting into recent reports that show just how much <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">disdain developers who are being forced to use GenAI have for the technology</a>. </p>
