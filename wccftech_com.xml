			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will not be a massive problem for ports and multiplatform games, as additional optimization work will get these games running decently on the system.</p>
<p>Famiiboards user MattAgain, who is a known developer who has worked in the video game industry for a long time and provided some valuable insights in the past, recently <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the newly revealed system, highlighting how the Switch 2 CPU, while being the part that deviates the most from the standard set by the system overall, is not going to be cause of concern for developers, as no one making a Switch 2 game from the ground up is complaining about it. The only small complaints have come from developers working on ports, which will apparently require a bit more CPU optimization work, compared to how relatively easily graphical resources can scale to the GPU. This additional CPU optimization work, however, isn't anything that shouldn't be expected, going from a power-hungry x86 to a mobile ARM CPU. So, for the time being, the system's CPU shouldn't be an impediment, and, as a whole, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting</a> a PlayStation 5 game to the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be much easier than porting a PlayStation 4 game to the original Switch, which is great news.</p>
<p>The fact that porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easier than porting games to its predecessor is definitely great news, as this should allow third-party developers to support the system with ease. Very few games have been confirmed for the new Nintendo consoles, but according to rumors, plenty of big publishers are looking into supporting the console heavily, such as Microsoft, who is reportedly working on ports of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">Diablo IV, Fallout 4 and even Starfield</a>. According to a recent report, basically, every third-party developer is considering supporting the system with their most ambitious AAA titles.</p>
