			<p>Following a successful final beta event, Embark's ARC Raiders launched to excellent initial figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily surpassing the concurrent user peak reached by the studio's previous game</a>, The Finals, which is even more impressive given that the latter is a free-to-play game, whereas the former is not.</p>



<p>This past weekend, the third-person PvPvE extraction shooter even surpassed that peak, settling around 354K concurrent players two days ago, an absolutely respectable figure that currently places the game at the 38th spot in Steam's all-time chart.</p>



<p>What really matters to game developers is sales, though, and there's good news on that front, too. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, ARC Raiders might have already sold between 1.6 million units (as estimated by <a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamalytic</a>) and 1.9 million units (as tracked by <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VG Insights</a> and <a href="https://playtracker.net/insight/game/119059?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayTracker</a>). Considering that the game is also available on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, it's not inconceivable that it might have sold close to three million units by now in total. Sure, the $40 budget price helps, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many shooter fans had already spent $70 on Battlefield 6 a couple of weeks ago</a>, and yet they deemed it worth spending more money on this one as well.</p>



<p>While we wait for official sales figures from Embark, the studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the post-launch roadmap for ARC Raiders. Later this month, players can look forward to a new map called Stella Montis, new Quests and gameplay items, new Arc machines (Matriarch and Shredder), and a community unlock event. In December, the developers will introduce more Quests, a new Raider deck, the Snowfall map condition, an event titled 'Flickering Flames', and the Expedition departure window. Other ongoing improvements without a specific timeframe include new feats and trials, more map conditions, cosmetics, and quality of life updates.</p>

			<p>Obsidian announced that the cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a> will receive the fan-requested turn-based mode tomorrow. It will be a public beta going live on Steam and the Xbox PC app.</p>



<p>As you already know if you played the game, Pillars of Eternity is currently available only as a real-time with pause (RTwP) game, whereas its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadfire</a>, eventually introduced an optional turn-based mode. Fans had long requested this option in the first installment, and now Obsidian is delivering.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll have a number of settings to tweak in the new turn-based mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Josh Sawyer, the project director (also known for Fallout: New Vegas and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a>), who said:</p>



<p><em>There were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how the turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno are trying to address those as well as they can. One of the major changes is that the action economy is a lot more accurate to the real time with pause game. It's not a 1:1 translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real time of pause mode. A lot of people commented that free actions felt abusable, which is true. That is now restricted and limited. That will feel like a significant change.</em></p>

<p>Another criticism levied against the turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire was that it simply felt too slow. A fix for that was increased lethality, which Deadfire got through a mod and the first installment is now receiving by default straight from Obsidian. Lastly, it will be possible to switch from combat to combat between real-time with pause and turn-based modes. Of course, being a beta, issues are expected. Obsidian encouraged players to check out the beta and deliver their feedback ahead of the final release of the mode.</p>



<p>Even though Pillars of Eternity is now a pretty old game (it was released ten years ago), the addition of the turn-based mode, now preferred by most users to RTwP, could be enough to make some people go back and check it out, especially after the positive launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, which is set in the same world.</p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Josh Sawyer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> he'd love to make Pillars of Eternity 3 with a Baldur's Gate 3-type budget. If that opportunity came along, he'd make it turn-based, so more experimentation feels like an interesting step toward that idea.</p>



<p>In other Obsidian news, the seemingly tireless studio has just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another great RPG: The Outer Worlds 2</a>.</p>
