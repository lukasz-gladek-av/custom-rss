			<p>A lot seems to be riding on Grand Theft Auto 6, as the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is considered to be among the growth engines for the entire game industry this year.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, the new entry in the Rockstar Games series is among the potential growth engines for the industry this year together with the Nintendo Switch 2, other handhelds, non-core markets and more, which could help pull the industry from the cycle it has been in for a while. Specifically speaking about Grand Theft Auto 6, it is highlighted in the presentation how the game's release this year will have a mixed impact on the industry due to how the game will only be released on consoles and will severely cannibalize hours and spend in other titles, but some publishers hope the game's pricing will break the $70 barrier, and re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about the potential impact Grand Theft Auto 6 will likely have on the entire video game industry. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">Last month</a>, we learned that some publishers have yet to commit to Fall 2025 release dates for their games to be sure to launch their games as far away as possible from Rockstar Games' open-world game. Unfortunately, all of this planning could be for naught, as there's still the concrete possibility the game will be delayed to 2026, which wouldn't be very surprising, considering we have seen nothing of the game since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">first trailer</a> released in late 2023.</p>

			<p>Season 2 will begin next week for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone 2 with some <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big tweaks and new features</a>. For example, console users will get the long-requested option to disable cross-play functionality in Ranked Play. To clarify, this will only disable matchmaking against PC users, who may have unfair advantages due to their hardware configuration; players will still be matchmade against players from another console.</p>
<p>Ranked Play mode will also see the addition of a 'Vote to Forfeit' feature, allowing players to vote for their team to forfeit a match if they're about to be eliminated or have lost a teammate. Forfeited matches will count as a standard loss and won't result in SR penalties or suspensions. Later in Season 2, players will also be able to rejoin a Ranked Play match if they suffered from a temporary connection issue. The developers believe this should help maintain fuller matches.</p>
<p>For Season 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Zombies is getting a new map called Into The Tomb. Further quality-of-life updates coming later to this mode include the ability for the host to pause the game (only if everyone is in the same party) and restoring a player's loadout, Essence, and Salvage when they rejoin a match they were kicked from due to going AFK.</p>
<p>There will be a slew of gameplay improvements coming to all modes, like reduced collisions with teammates for improved maneuverability, bullet penetration updates, a weapon balance pass, reduced weapon movement when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity perk equipped, and improved player visibility in Kill Confirmed by reducing the height of dog tags. Later in Season 2, players with the War Cry perk active will be tagged with an icon over their heads so others know they are receiving faster health regeneration.</p>
<p>When it comes to Call of Duty Warzone 2, the new Season is set to bring several gameplay tweaks, such as faster reload speeds, reduced penalty when sprint-to-fire jumping, increased weapon swap speed, increased jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump. Parachuting will also get quicker thanks to a faster parachute cut animation and increased player velocity when landing from a cut parachute.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Treyarch continues the fight against cheaters with improved client and server-side detections and systems, a major kernel-level driver update, driver security enhancement, an enhanced encryption process, and a brand-new tamper detection system.</p>

			<p>It's been a long time since we last covered Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Chinese developer Lenzee Games&nbsp;has been largely quiet since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 announcement</a> of the Soulslike action RPG, but the release date is finally approaching, and Chinese media and streamers have just published some new promising gameplay footage captured at 4K@60FPS.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is set in the land of Shu during the late Ming Dynasty, during a time of war that is only worsened by a mysterious disease that spawns monstrous creatures. Players will become the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior stricken with amnesia who must explore this perilous land while suffering from the terrifying Feathering Disease.</p>
<p>During the game, players will upgrade Wuchang's arsenal and master new skills gathered from fallen enemies. The fighting style can be enhanced by sacrificing the elusive Red Mercury and developing new techniques picked up during the journey. Powerful enchantments to the weapons in Wuchang's arsenal can be added as well to tailor the player's favored combat style.</p>
<p>She'll go through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins and the like to face against grotesque abominations that draw on ancient Chinese lore. As the player and Wuchang piece together her lost memories, the choices will reportedly lead you to one of several endings, in a major change from usual Asian titles. The endings will be based on the decisions made, the secrets uncovered, and the allies chosen.</p>

<p>Leenzee Games, whose only prior project is the relatively unknown cyberpunk sci-fi VR interactive movie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1523370/AD_2047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.D. 2047</a>, is promising a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and stunning visuals, making for an unforgettable adventure.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Wuchang: Fallen Feathers should launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 later this year, published by 505 Games. It will also be available through Game Pass from day one.</p>
