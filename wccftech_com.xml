			<p>You may or may not remember, back when Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King were trying to get the acquisition across the finish line, Microsoft signed deals with the two other major console platform makers to continue (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-players/">or in one case, to start</a>) releasing Call of Duty games on that platform. Microsoft and Nintendo's deal was a 10-year commitment, and while no one really expected a Call of Duty game to come to the Nintendo Switch, it seemed like we could expect the shooter franchise to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Well, we're two years into that 10-year commitment, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is no longer a poorly kept secret but the latest console on the market. So, where is Call of Duty on the Nintendo Switch 2? According to Jez Corden at Windows Central, it's just around the corner and into the new year.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">X (formerly Twitter)</a> regarding the series' arrival on Switch, Corden replied, "<em>The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Another user quoted the above reply from Corden, asking for further clarification, and if the arrival of Call of Duty on Switch could be counted as "<em>close</em>," to which Corden said, "<em>I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Now, Corden has been right in the past when it comes to rumours regarding Microsoft properties, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be cautious of his claim. We do at least know that Microsoft has to make good on its promise; the question of when and how is what is left in the balance.</p>



<p>For example, we don't know if Activision would aim to put Call of Duty on the first-generation Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, which, if that is the case, would almost definitely limit the scope of the version Activision is trying to create for the hybrid handhelds. Perhaps in that scenario, it's Call of Duty: Warzone, not a mainline release, that arrives on the platform.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps Warzone hits both the Switch and Switch 2, while the latest mainline entry, Black Ops 7, arrives on the Switch 2 to take advantage of the extra hardware capabilities on the new device. Or, while Warzone makes it on to the Switch and Switch 2, the next mainline Call of Duty game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2027-introduce-new-sub-series-says-leaker/">not the new sub-series said to be coming in 2027</a>, but whatever 2026's Call of Duty will be), is the one to arrive on Switch 2.</p>



<p>Or none of that, with Nintendo and Activision taking what is arguably the weirdest route, but one that would harken back to the days when games for handheld consoles were made as somewhat changed, or sometimes entirely changed, experiences compared to their home-console contemporaries: a completely brand-new Call of Duty game that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 and isn't just a port of the other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, according to Corden, we won't have to speculate much longer.</p>

			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the co-founders of Infinity Ward and Respawn Entertainment, and arguably one of the most renowned creators in the video game industry in terms of first-person shooters, as a co-creator of Call of Duty, and as a lead for Apex Legends, and most recently Battlefield, died in a car crash over the weekend in Southern California. </p>



<p>The tragic news comes from <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">an NBCLA report</a>, which outlines that it was a single-car crash that was reported to the authorities at 12:45 pm on Sunday, December 21, 2025, with the vehicle hitting a concrete barrier, trapping the driver in the car as it caught on fire and ejecting the passenger. </p>



<p>Zampella was only 55 years old at the time of his death, and his loss is one that the video game industry will be feeling for years to come. He'd <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/">taken over direction of the Battlefield franchise</a> and had also taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">a major role within EA as one of the company's leads under its EA Entertainment branch</a>, in recent years, though he's mostly known for his time at Infinity Ward, where he was one of the key leads behind the original Modern Warfare series within the Call of Duty franchise.</p>



<p>The news has prompted several developers and industry figures to share some words about Zampella and  the impact he had on the industry and on their lives, and to offer condolences to his family, who are the ones, more than anyone, who will feel his loss the most.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, EA has yet to put out an official statement regarding Zampella's death. We will update this article when that occurs. Our condolences go out to Vince Zampella's family and friends. </p>



<p><strong>Update- 1 12/22/2025:</strong> EA shared a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">Kotaku</a> on the loss of Vince Zampella. It reads, "<em>This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Update - 2 12/22/2025:</strong> NBCLA has updated its original report as more information about the incident has become available to identify Vince Zampella as the driver of the vehicle. The car was reported to be a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS, and a video of the crash was provided to authorities. There is a graphic video circulating on X (formerly Twitter) that has been confirmed to be Zampella and the passenger crashing in his Ferrari, so be warned if that is something you would rather not see on your social media timeline.</p>
