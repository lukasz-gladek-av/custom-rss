			<p>During the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct, KING Art and Deep Silver debuted a gorgeous in-engine trailer for the upcoming real-time strategy game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV and shared some details about the game's inspiration. Originally announced at Gamescom 2025 and slated for a 2026 launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272360/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War_IV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>), the game will, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3u6jlJUEVI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Creative Director Jan Theysen</a>, follow in the footsteps of the first game in the franchise.</p>



<p><em>The first big decision, of course, was what we were aiming for. Do we try to do a Dawn of War 1 or 2 or a mix of both? We like both of them. But in the end, we said no, let's really go with Dawn of War 1; that's our guiding star. We talked to a lot of people: 'What do you remember from Dawn of War 1? What made it Dawn of War 1 for you?' And everybody was excited about sync kills. That was just something that everybody remembered, and so we said, okay, we definitely want sync kills in the game, but could we maybe even make it more spectacular or something that 20 years later is super cool? And so we came up with a new system.</em></p>



<p><em>I think when you do a new version or reinterpretation of a classic game, the challenge is always that you're not trying to recreate the old game, but you try to recreate the feeling that people had when they played the old game, right? What you basically want to do is you look at the old game, you ask yourself, okay, how did this work and how did this make us feel and how can we do this 20 years later?</em></p>



<p>Jan Theysen then discussed the developers' choices when it comes to the factions that will be featured in Dawn of War IV:</p>



<p><em>There are so many cool factions and so many cool stories you could choose from. We ended up picking the factions we picked because we felt if we do like a new version or an evolution of Dawn of War, you need the Blood Ravens and you need the Orks. That is just a given.</em></p>



<p><em>We thought about adding the Nekrons to Dawn of War IV because we felt that, you know, Nekrons were kind of promised for Dawn of War 3 and never came. So, it felt like a nice touch to finally give them to the players. There may be a faction that never had a big role in the Dawn of War games and there are not that many. The Adeptus Mechanicus is definitely a big and important faction in the 40K universe and they were never part of the Dawn of War franchise, so we felt that's a good opportunity to have something new for everyone.</em></p>

<p>As a reminder, the first three games were made by Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went independent from SEGA in March 2024</a> and is now working on a self-published turn-based strategy game called Earth vs Mars, <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-announces-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as announced in February 2025</a>.</p>



<p>As for KING Art, the German studio's last game was the real-time strategy game Iron Harvest, which launched in 2020. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it an 8 out of 10 score</a> back then.</p>

			<p>Today, during the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct livestream, Canadian indie developer Nine Dots Studio shared new details and a new trailer for Outward 2. First and foremost, the release window for the action RPG sequel is now officially set for Summer 2026; wishlisting is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2849490/Outward_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, CEO and Creative Director at Nine Dots Studio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/outward-2-qa-director-says-sequel-is-a-few-years-away-will-be-just-as-cruel-obscure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whom we previously interviewed at GDC 2024</a>), shared a statement to outline what fans can expect from the sequel to the 2019 game that recently surpassed three million units sold to date:</p>



<p><em>With Outward 2, we finally have the means to deliver the vision we had for the game — a believable and grounded adventurer experience. We kept the same ingredients, stayed true to our vision, and improved on what was not up to what we wanted - our combat system, immersion, and character creator. When we started working on Outward in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate simulation of an adventurer's life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With Outward 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our DLCs. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer's life. Much better graphics, better immersion, and better combat.</em></p>

<p>In Outward 2, players will once again be just an average adventurer instead of a legendary hero. They'll however get to shape their modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, including devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon's Bastion, to name a couple. When knocked out, the player's journey continues and they must live with the consequences. They could be robbed and left to rot, saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or worse.</p>



<p>According to the developers, the game also features a full-year seasonal cycle that will transform the world of Aurai during a playthrough. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. The four distinct regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. </p>



<p>The new Exercise system reinforces the player's tactical choices, such as the weight and material of armor and weapons used. Passive skills will spark and grow based on how they play. Players should seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai who can teach them survival techniques for a fee.</p>



<p>As hinted earlier, Outward 2 features challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset. It is further enhanced with a larger variety of tools, weapon combinations, and animations that provide players with more fluidity and control. Magic is also going to be pretty involved, as it requires players to cast spells through rituals; for example, one could send a fire stone into the air to create a ring that empowers skills with deadly flames. </p>



<p>Inventory management will be critical, as some discoveries won't be worth the precious space. Moreover, during a fight in Outward 2, players may even need to drop their backpack to attack and evade more effectively. However, the sequel adds a mule that can help carry goods.</p>



<p>To get through the harsh journey, asking a friend to help in two-player local split-screen or online co-op action is always a good idea, especially if planning to cover each other's weaknesses.</p>
