			<p>As 2025 approaches its final months, AI becomes more and more a subject of discussion across all industries, including game development. The games industry has long utilized artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, with the veritable explosion of generative AI in the last few years and the concurrent ballooning of game budgets and development timelines, some developers have been exploring whether it could be used to reduce costs and production time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our most recent interview with independent developer Epictellers Entertainment</a> about their upcoming cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, we asked the Spanish team their opinion on the thorny matter. CEO and co-founder Richard Pillosu was crystal-clear: he'd like AI to help him with daily tasks around the house, but he doesn't really want it to touch any creative areas.</p>



<p><em>The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it.</em></p>



<p>Famous video game designer and director Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his own take on AI</a>, calling it 'a friend' that will help him stay ahead. However, he also noted that he wants AI to do the menial tasks while he focuses on the creative part, so in that regard, he is aligned with Pillosu.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we interviewed actor Feodor Chin</a>, too, who provided a similar take from his point of view:</p>



<p><em>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings.</em></p>



<p>Will the games industry be able to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to allow humans to give their best creatively without replacing jobs? That remains to be seen, but we'll continue to gauge the opinions within the industry and the various implementations of the development studios.</p>

			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>

			<p>Major news is brewing for Bandai Namco's JRPG series, Tales, confirming several new projects and providing updates on its next mainline entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-tales-series-remasters-are-on-the-way">More Tales Series Remasters Are On The Way</h2>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92001">Ryokutya2089</a>, ahead of the launch of Tales of Xillia Remastered, which will launch on October 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa spoke with Famitsu about the series' future, starting with the future of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">Remaster Project.</a></p>



<p>According to the producer, two titles are in development as part of the project, ranging from verification to the final stages of development. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to know which entry in the series will get remastered next, as it will be revealed fairly soon.</p>



<p>In addition, Tomizawa-san confirmed to Famitsu that the Tales of Xillia 2 remaster is still in development. More information on the project will be revealed as soon as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-entry-in-the-tales-series-is-still-away-from-reveal">The New Entry in the Tales series Is Still Away From Reveal</h2>



<p>Besides commenting on future series remasters, Tomizawa-san also briefly touched upon the next main entry in the series. This new game is still under development, but it will be a while before it's announced. </p>



<p>Compared to past console generations, where multiple entries in the series were announced and then released in Japan close to one another, this is a radically different approach. Hopefully, the long wait since <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a>, which launched back in 2021, will be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-of-the-series-audience-is-in-the-west">Most of the Series' Audience is in the West</h2>



<p>One interesting tidbit of information shared with Famitsu by Tomizawa-san is that most of the Tales series audience is in the West, over 70%. This is rather surprising, considering how the series was long neglected in North America and Europe with late releases and games that never made the jump.</p>



<p>Among these Japan-exclusive games are the 2D games Tales of Destiny remake and Tales of Rebirth, which are among the best entries in the series. Could either of these games be one of the remasters currently in the works?</p>



<p>Thankfully, those willing to go <span>the extra mile to play any of the Tales games that weren't released in the West via emulation have the chance to experience them in English. L</span>ast year, Life Bottle Productions released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/">Tales of Rebirth English translation patch</a>&nbsp;that also adds new features such as subtitles for animated movies, battle subtitles, and more.</p>
