			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is finally here, and before you jump into Obsidian Entertainment's new space-faring adventure in its dystopian world, this guide will help give you a leg-up with some tips and tricks to survive and thrive in The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>It should go without saying that I won't be delving into any story spoilers, but incase it needed to be said, there it is. If you want to check out more about The Outer Worlds 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">then go look at my full review for the game.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide">The Outer Worlds 2 Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-abl-always-be-looting">ABL: Always Be Looting</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's no such thing as carrying too much or your bag being too heavy and making you move slower in The Outer Worlds 2, so it's in your best interest to pick up everything that's not nailed down. Loot it all! Show no remorse! Plunder every corpse, unlocked box, locked box, safe, anything you can get your hands on.</p>



<p>But be aware when you're trying to grab something that'll be marked as 'Stolen.' You can steal without repercussions so long as there's no one nearby to see you do it. If there's a witness, however, you'll lose standing with whichever faction you've just stolen from. Not much at first, but keeping it up will make it all the more difficult to go into towns and settlements safely and without being attacked. </p>



<h3 id="h-preach-speech">Preach Speech</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Realistically, you can build your character however you like, putting all your points into a few, multiple, or even just one skill on your journey to the level cap at level 30. Each time you level up you get to two Skill Points to spend however you like, and making those choices are all part of the RPG side of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>But if I could make one recommendation, it would be to level up your Speech skill. Talking to people is arguably half of the whole gameplay experience in The Outer Worlds 2, and while different skills can give you different conversation options, Speech is the skill to level to solve most problems without violence, convince others of your point of view, and, frankly, the one that gives you more interesting conversation options.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-underestimate-the-power-of-shock-and-plasma">Don't Underestimate the Power of Shock and Plasma</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With how many different weapons there are in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll practically be tripping over them and the weapon modifications you can make. Tweaking and adjusting your loadout is key to ensuring that you can survive any encounter you have.</p>



<p>But don't put too much stock into the overall damage output number that appears with each weapon. Pay much more attention to the kinds of elemental damage you can do with different elemental modifications, specifically Plasma and Shock.</p>



<p>A weapon with Plasma damage that technically has a lower overall damage number compared to a weapon without Plasma damage will do more damage overall, with how Plasma effects can stack, and with how Plasma does damage to enemies over time. The same goes for Shock damage, which is especially effective against the automechanical enemies you'll face.</p>



<p>You're essentially always better off going with elemental damage for your weapons over base damage stats.</p>



<h3 id="h-some-companions-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Companions are More Useful Than Others</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the course of your journey in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll recruit six companions who join you on your adventures, with two of them coming outside of the ship with you. Each of them can help you in different ways, with some being more useful in combat while others are better to have around when you're exploring. </p>



<p>Again, picking which companions join you when you get out of your ship is part of the role-playing you'll do in The Outer Worlds 2, but one of the first two companions you get in the game is arguably the most useful to keep around in your party at all times, and that's Niles.</p>



<p>He's great for taking heat off you in combat, but where his usefulness really lies is outside of it, because you'll always be able to turn to him and craft ammo, weapon mods, armor mods, updates for your companions; pretty much anything you can do at a Workbench, Niles can do for you on the go.</p>



<p>Yes, you'll be able to find Workbenches at different spots in The Outer Worlds 2, but when you're in the middle of trekking across one of the planets you explore in the Arcadia system, particularly early on in the game, it's easy to find yourself low on ammo and health. Having Niles with you means you can use the resources you've collected to keep yourself going, without having to fast-travel back to a town to restock and make the trek back out to where you were, which you'll have to do on foot because running across the map is the only way to get from place to place until you've unlocked fast travel points.</p>



<h3 id="h-do-drugs-keep-your-health-up">Do Drugs, Keep Your Health Up</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, I'm not actually advocating you do drugs in real life. But within The Outer Worlds 2, your inhaler, which is essentially a toxic drug that refills your health bar and can kill you if you overdose on it, is an important element to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Specifically, you'll want to keep an eye on how many Inhaler Charges you have at any given time. Running out means you can't heal while in combat, even if you know you have food resources in your inventory, ready for you to eat. You can eat them outside of combat, but not during. Your Inhaler is the only way to stay alive in the middle of a fight, and you'll always want to make sure you have enough charges to get you through any situation.</p>



<p>Basically, you'll want to craft as many charges as possible and/or purchase and collect as many resources as possible to give you additional charges. Right from the beginning of the game, you can have as many charges as you have the resources for, so stocking up on as many as possible ensures you'll be able to get through any fight, so long as you give yourself the time and space to let the charge heal you, and let your toxicity drain. </p>



<p>Speaking of toxicity drain, another point is to find armour that drains your toxicity faster as soon as possible. Draining your toxicity level faster means you can use your Inhaler sooner and more often in combat, to help you get through any situation. </p>

			<p>Silver Pines is a Twin Peaks-inspired 2D survival horror metroidvania game (how often does one of those come along) that'll arrive on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 sometime in 2026 from developer Wych Elm Games and publisher Team17. </p>



<p>The game follows Red Walker, a private investigator who has been hired to find Eddie Velvet, a musician who has mysteriously vanished, though, as you might already suspect, while looking for Velvet, Walker begins to uncover a deeper plot and darker mystery behind Velvet's disappearance.</p>



<p>Its art style and survival horror gameplay make it seem like a truly unique debut title from this new indie team. Silver Pines was first announced during the Galaxies Showcase yesterday, and is an easy addition for indie games to look out for as we inch closer to 2026.</p>

<iframe title="Silver Pines | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_PVwrQivKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll be fighting off shadows while solving puzzles to try and get to the bottom of Velvet's disappearance, which could also lead to Walker's own redemption, as he struggles to deal with a dark history of his own.</p>



<p>We get a lot of horror games, but few of them look like this. Silver Pines seems to be dripping with atmosphere and narrative potential, and it'll be particularly interesting to see how its metroidvania navigational focus plays into the story it's trying to tell.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we will hear more about this game soon and will be able to jump into Silver Pines in time for Halloween 2026. It's always exciting when a new indie studio puts out a trailer like this with a game looking like it could just be the dark horse hit yet for next year.</p>



<p>If you're looking for more horror games, and ones that you don't have to wait until next year to play, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">you should check out Beneath</a>, a new Lovecraftian horror shooter that's out on PC and consoles in just a few days from the time of this writing on October 27. There's also of course Bloober Team's latest release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn, which you can read Wccftech's full review of by Francesco De Meo, here.</a></p>
