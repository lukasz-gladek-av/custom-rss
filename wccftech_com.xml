			<p>Bandai Namco hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/">Little Nightmares Showcase</a> today, which the company announced was happening just last week, and it revealed a lot more than what players originally expected.</p>
<p>The expectation was that it would be a showcase focused on Little Nightmares III, with new gameplay and a release date revealed, which did happen. Bandai and Supermassive Games announced that Little Nightmares III will arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on <strong>October 10, 2025.</strong> We also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2baUKpm5k">10-minute look at gameplay</a> from a Carnevale level in the game, and the confirmation that it'll also release on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was the announcement of several new Little Nightmares projects.</p>

<p>Firstly, a remaster of the original game, Little Nightmares: Enhanced Edition, was announced, though in a bit of an odd way.</p>
<p>The remaster will arrive on all platforms on October 10, same as Little Nightmares III. Players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC will be able to play the game at a 4K resolution at 60 FPS, with improved graphics, ray-traced reflections, faster loading times, revised checkpoints, and new assistance mechanics.</p>
<p>But if you want to experience the original game with all of that right now, you can, by pre-ordering a digital version of Little Nightmares III. To be clear, this enhanced edition remaster <strong>will not be out</strong> for players to buy separately for $39.99 until October. But pre-order LN3, and you'll get access to it "<em>immediately</em>," as part of your pre-order purchase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - Comparative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6bX6GUEqFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the one hand, it's not a bad deal to get the new version of the original and the next game in the series at no extra cost when you pre-order the third game. The Enhanced Edition of the first game is available for pre-ordering any edition of LN3, from the standard to the premium collectors edition. On the other hand, the enhanced edition Tarsier did for <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-ii-tease-gamescom/">Little Nightmares II</a> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/little-nightmares-ii-enhanced-edition-out-today-on-ps5/">free</a> for those who already owned the game, which is not the case with the enhanced edition of the first Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been mixed online, though it'll be interesting to see if fans attempt to push Bandai Namco to make this new enhanced edition available now for players who want to get it without pre-ordering the third game.</p>
<p>The next major news of the showcase was a Little Nightmares VR game called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes. Very little about this game was revealed, with Bandai only showing a short teaser trailer.</p>

<p>The other new projects revealed were a new audio podcast, called The Sounds of Little Nightmares. A comic series, called Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, and a novel, called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones.</p>

<p>All together, five Little Nightmares projects were revealed, on top of the news we already expected with the release date for Little Nightmares III. There was even a small teaser for a sixth project for the series that looked like it could potentially be a stop-motion film or TV adaptation. We can't say for sure, because the teaser was inserted partway through the showcase, and not discussed again. Hopefully, we'll hear more about it soon.</p>
