			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>

			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for several PS4 exclusives.</p>



<p>The new version of the emulator, which can be downloaded from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">its official website</a> by setting the Update Channel to Nightly, brings many current PlayStation 4 exclusives closer to a fully playable state on PC while also booting games that did not launch in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">previous versions of the emulator</a>, a crucial step for further emulation improvements.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProteinGaming-97">ProteinGaming</a> showcases how games like Ratchet &amp; Clank 2016, God of War III Remastered, The Order: 1886, the P.T. demo, Infamous: Second Son, Uncharted: Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush and others run under the new version of the emulator on a system powered by an i5-12400F CPU, RTX 4060 GPU and 32 GB RAM. </p>



<p>While some games, like The Order 1886, are nowhere near playable, others have seen considerable performance improvements, like God of War III Remastered, Gravity Rush 2, and The Last Guardian. So, it may not be long before these games become fully playable on PC, even without an official port.</p>

<p>While PlayStation 4 games becoming playable on PC would be more than enough for most players who never had the chance to try out these games on the original hardware, improved emulation could also lead to graphics and performance improvements. </p>



<p>Bloodborne, whose emulation was further improved in the new version of the ShadPS4 emulator, not only can be made to run at 60 FPS on PC, its visuals can be enhanced significantly with the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-project-update/">Remastered Project visual overhaul</a>, which introduces, among other improvements, dynamic shadows and is set to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-addressing-low-quality-meshes/">get another critical improvement down the line.</a></p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator, an up-to-date compatibility list and more can be found on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>
