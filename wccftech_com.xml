			<p>If you're dipping your toes into the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular MOBA</a>, League of Legends, you'll notice that there are a few roles for you to try out in Summoner's Rift. If you want to try your hand at jungling, you'll need to get to grips with the best routes for clearing, how to gank your opponents, and how to shot call on essential things like taking the Dragon or doing Baron Nashor. However, before you can think about that, you need to choose a jungler. Here are some of the best junglers to choose from if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out more of our League of Legends guides here:</p>

<h2>Best Beginner Junglers in League of Legends</h2>
<p>Jungling can be quite tricky to get a handle on, especially as you are responsible for maintaining your health, mana and dealing enough damage to kill jungle camps efficiently on your own. On top of that, you have to juggle responsibilities such as warding, having a good lane presence, and overthrowing the enemy jungler. If you want to try your hand at being a jungler, here are some of the best for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Amumu</strong> is a great jungler to start with, regardless of what season it is. Not only does he have a lot of ganking capability, but he has a relatively smooth camp clear. Typically, with Amumu, you start at Raptors using your E so that you don't have to get a leash from either the top or bottom lane. This means that the lane that would be helping you doesn't miss out on vital early-game minions, and you can get your early-game camps with minimal issues. Amumu has great crowd control, with his Q stunning the enemy and pulling Amumu to the opponent, and his Ultimate stuns everyone who is in the circle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Nocturne</strong> is incredibly fun and has the potential to snowball and hypercarry if you play him correctly. He can be a bit difficult to get to grips with, but he has a ton of potential. It would be best if you found the balance between getting farm and ganking lanes to be able to be a threat to the opponent. One of the keys to being able to be a good Nocturne is using your Ultimate to gank an ally and help them pick off their lane opponent. Getting those assists in any time your Ultimate is up is key.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sejuani</strong> also has a lot of potential this season and is relatively easy to learn. If you don't like the idea of being a squishy jungler, Sejuani is perfect to pick. She gets quite tanky and can survive team fights and lane ganks with ease, especially with the aid of her crowd control. Of course, like any jungler, you need to make sure you find the balance between farming and ganking. However, she has a lot of defensive options with her knockback, her Ultimate, and the slows that come with it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No matter the season,&nbsp;<strong>Vi</strong> remains viable. She has a lot of damage potential and is more of a bruiser than a tank jungler. She has great damage output and camp clear, with added mobility in her Q. With how her Ultimate and Q work, it makes it easy for Vi to gank a lane. However, due to the skill shot nature of her Q, it can be difficult to land the hit on a champion, especially if they move unpredictably. Despite that, Vi is a lot of fun and has great potential if she can get ahead.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best beginner junglers you can try out in League of Legends right now. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As we get closer to the release of Avowed, Obsidian Entertainment is sharing more tidbits about the game as well as what they think is core to the RPG genre. Speaking to Gamesradar, Obsidian's Region Director and Senior Area Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-dev-channels-baldurs-gate-3-by-admitting-that-the-core-of-rpgs-is-missable-content-that-most-players-might-not-ever-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that missable content is what makes them special, hinting that the same design guideline will apply to Avowed.</p>
<p><em>I think the core of RPGs that makes them special is missable content, to be honest, and it makes the experience feel so much more personal to how you play the game. If you talk to somebody like, 'Oh, I found this thing under the docks. There's this little secret under there on the eastern side of the docks that you can find. And you can also climb up to the top, and there's stuff up there.' But if you find that, and your friend doesn't, they found something else, and it creates a very interesting dialogue about the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to draw your attention to things that we want you to engage with. The lighthouse is very tall, and so everybody's going to see a big, tall thing and want to go climb. And so we want to support that as well. And you can do that, and you can jump off into the ocean if you like. And so we try to draw your attention that way.</em></p>
<p>During my recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>, I didn't exactly stumble upon lots of missable content. Then again, it was just the first area of the game, Dawnshore. That kind of stuff might be reserved for the latter areas. However, I did enjoy my time with Avowed:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>The game launches on February 18, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
