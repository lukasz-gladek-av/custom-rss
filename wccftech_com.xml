			<p>Renowned AMD leaker KeplerL2 has revealed in a series of posts on the NeoGaf board (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mgijwx/keplerl2_xbox_xs_hardware_has_sold_less_than_30/?share_id=Ch1EvdKxiKZjo7CR5NGHO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>) that the Xbox Series S and X consoles have sold less than 30 million units, according to his estimates based on AMD sales data.</p>



<p><em>They aren't even at 30 million. You don't need third party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales. Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console; Van Gogh and all its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles. Z1/Z2 are repurposed laptop chips (Rembrandt/Phoenix/Strix) and fall under the Client segment.</em></p>



<p><em>It is also important to note that AMD's number is higher than what Sony/Xbox would count as unit sales since it includes chips sold but still in-flight (i.e., being assembled somewhere).<br>So Q3 &lt;100 million console units with ~66 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck would put Xbox Series S and X at a maximum of 29 million. Q4 &gt;100 million console units with ~75 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck means Xbox sold a minimum of 21 million units. So, Xbox sales for this gen range from a minimum of 21 million + Q1/Q2 2025 unit sales to a maximum of 29 million + Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025.</em></p>



<p>This means Sony's PlayStation 5 could have around three times the install base of Microsoft's Xbox duo. The choice to create a lower priced model, the Series S, was not nearly enough to stop the constantly dwindling sales. Even in the last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otherwise profitable quarter</a>, Xbox hardware sales decreased 22% on a year-over-year basis.</p>



<p>At least the Xbox Series S and X are not sold at a loss anymore, according to KeplerL2, unlike Sony's PlayStation 5:</p>



<p><em>PS5 had a brief period of being even/profitable, but then component prices went up (N7 wafers, GDDR6, and a few others), and it went right back to losing money. As far as I know, the regular PS5 is still sold at a minor loss; only the PS5 Pro is profitable. They did a die shrink for the Series X and raised prices; it should be profitable now.</em></p>
