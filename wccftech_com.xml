			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the next game coming from Silent Hill 2 Remake and Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team, and though we don't have a solid release date for it beyond a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Fall 2025 release window</a>, we do have a new look at gameplay with a new 10-minute gameplay showcase.</p>



<p>The video shows the protagonist digging through Sector A-0, showing off how you'll manipulate gravity and your environment in order to move towards your objective. It also shows more layers to the horror gameplay that the sci-fi adventure will feature, as you carefully and slowly creep around each corner, finger on the trigger of your weapon, ready to defend yourself against whatever monstrosity awaits.</p>

<p>First revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/">October 2024</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn looks to be the most confident and the most terrifying work from Bloober Team yet. While the studio's history as a horror game developer began strong with Layers of Fear, it faltered with back-to-back lacklustre releases that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwityLnytNOOAxVY2MkDHRPGLksQFnoECBUQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q6lWprVE2HpS_CCCQT0qJ">the studio even admitted were poor</a>.</p>



<p>It has since turned things around following its success with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, which has led to the studio also taking on a remake of the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Silent Hill</a> game.</p>



<p>We've seen plenty of Cronos: The New Dawn gameplay at this point, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/">recent deep-dive just weeks ago</a>. The only thing we're really missing from Cronos: The New Dawn, is a release date. Hopefully, we'll hear about one soon. </p>

			<p>Out of Time is a new multiplayer roguelike third-person action game from developer <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> that will launch this coming September 25, 2025, on PC, and will initially be exclusively available on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vi-all-dlc-free-on-epic-games-store/">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<p>Out of Time puts players in a world where an event called "<em>The Shattering</em>" has ruptured space and time, leaving a final safe haven for people across all timelines called Infinitopia. Outside of Infinitopia's safety, however, you'll be charged with trying to save the remaining members of mankind from threats like dinosaurs, giant mechs, dragons, evil humanoids, mutant crabs, killer robots, and practically everything else that can exist across the entire timeline of the universe. </p>

<p>"<em>With </em><em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids," said Jordan Maynard, chief creative officer at Manticore Games, in a press release. "<em>The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!</em>"</p>

<p>Out of Time is available to pre-purchase on the Epic Games Store on PC for $24.99 USD, and while Manticore Games is clear on it only initially being an EGS exclusive, it does not say when the game will be heading to Steam. Chief executive officer at Manticore Games, Frederic Descamps, does add that there are plans to bring it to other platforms, he just doesn't specify which ones.</p>



<p>"<em>Manticore’s mission is to create complex immersive multiplayer experiences. We’ve built </em><em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core UGC platform and Unreal. <em>We’re already planning more eras and PvP modes, plus additional platforms."</em></p>

			<p>If you follow the video game industry at all, then unless you've been living under a rock for the month of July, you've heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft enacting its latest mass layoff</a>, which cut 9,000+ people across the company, a large chunk of those cuts hitting its Xbox and gaming division. It was an awful way to start the month, as we learned, and are still learning, how those cuts impacted studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a>, several ZeniMax Media developers, some of whom are still with the studio and others who were impacted in the layoffs, called out Microsoft and Xbox executive leadership for how poorly the mass layoff was handled, the chaos it caused, and the execution of the whole situation, which some called "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>."</p>



<p>One former employee described to Game Developer how they were booted out of their work email, Slack, everything, without any proper notice that they'd been laid off, and were left for hours without any communication from Microsoft. Member of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZWU-CWA</a> union, Page Branson, said the lack of any process to the layoffs left people "<em>distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day, or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day</em>." </p>



<p>When Branson and others started to get a better picture of who was impacted and who wasn't, Branson said that some of those who were cut were "<em>absolutely crucial</em>" and "<em>integral</em>" members of staff, specifically for The Elder Scrolls Online. Autumn Mitchell, a senior QA developer and also a member of the ZWU-CWA union, added, "<em>It's not okay. It wasn't normal. I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal—it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way—it's not."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting. It's disgusting. If I could get any message to any executive right now it would be review this process because it's not normal and it's not okay."</em></p>



<p>Branson also spoke about what is perhaps the most significant long-term impact of mass layoffs like this: the sudden disappearance of institutional knowledge that developers who had been working at the studio for years had. "<em>A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight</em>. <em>Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly.</em>"</p>



<p>Mitchell added that they estimated a third of ZeniMax Media's institutional knowledge is now gone thanks to the layoffs, and that they "<em>don't really know</em>" how those left standing are supposed to continue making games at the same quality they did before. They also added that they don't see how moving forward in some cases is even possible without critical members of the team who were impacted in the layoffs getting brought back.</p>



<p>Every story from the Microsoft layoffs is upsetting, and these details only compound the sadness for the developers and the frustration towards Microsoft and Xbox leadership for their carelessness in how things were handled. The short-term financial benefit that comes with having fewer people on the payroll only digs a deeper debt when it comes to the lack of experiential knowledge left behind, and the inability to properly train and mentor a new class of workers to take the place of the developers who players praise for creating the games we love in the first place. </p>



<p>These kinds of cuts, and the careless ways in which they're handled, are what make it difficult to see any real future for Xbox and Microsoft in the video game industry beyond that of a third-party publishing house. And even then, it's worth asking why anyone in the video game industry should place their trust in Microsoft, if the company is going to cut whatever it wants to cut, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">just to chase the latest trends in tech</a>.</p>
