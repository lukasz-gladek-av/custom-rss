			<p>The moon has always been a spot of interest and wonder that humankind has dreamed about reaching and finally setting foot on, if briefly. Establishing moon bases and creating a permanent foothold on the barren landscape is something that humanity still has not completely mastered in this day and age. In science fiction, when you leave Earth and set up a colony elsewhere, there’s probably a good reason for leaving God’s green Earth. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">PRAGMATA</a>, the journey is about doing the exact opposite: escaping the confines of the lunar stations and returning to Earth, not just by yourself but with a young girl/android named Diana along with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">PRAGMATA</a> is much more than an escort mission. While the playable astronaut controls all of the movement and offensive capabilities, the young Diana riding piggyback along the way has some serious hacking prowess. As players dodge and shoot their way through autonomous death machines and androids, Diana can simultaneously hack through the enemy’s defenses. On paper, this sounds arduous with having to juggle between moving on one analog stick, aiming with another, firing with the shoulder buttons, and trying to navigate through a hacking minigame with Diana on the face buttons. In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core. In practice, the earlier hacking segments only took a second or two to move your little avatar around and collect the requisite nodes in order to disable the enemy shields.</p>
<p>There is a few weapons at the player’s disposal in PRAGMATA early on, each having its own mechanics and capabilities beyond just shooting and dealing damage. The player’s signature pistol has infinite ammo and takes time to recharge, while other weapons picked up off the ground might only have a clip or two before they’re discarded and replaced with something else. There’s a variety of energy weapons, and I leaned more into the energy shotgun type when it came to blasting my way through the brief demo.</p>
<p>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time.</p>

<p>PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that Capcom has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxCboik0Is">five years ago today</a>. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</p>
<p>There’s still some time to go before this adventure is ready for players’ hands as PRAGMATA will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced PlayStation handheld will feature AI upscaling, and some of its specs will address the lower memory bandwidth compared to the base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, well-known AMD leaker KeplerL2 revealed some additional information about the handheld that's been rumored to be in the works for a while, revealing that the AMD APU that will power the system will be the only one from the company to have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-announced-coming-this-holiday-2025.1685066/page-5#post-270507134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI upscaling</a> in the near future. The leaker also added that the handheld will come with <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498839">16 GB LPDDR5X RAM</a> despite launching in a few years, as LPDDR6 is still away, and that it will have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1/3 of the base PlayStation 5 memory bandwidth</a>, although with more cache and improved memory compression. Clarifying the cache the system will feature, the leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will come with 4MB of L2 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, which the current generation systems don't have. Regarding the architecture of the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 reiterated that both the handheld and the PlayStation 6 will be based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gfx13 (RDNA5/UDNA) architecture.</a></p>
<p>While the PlayStation handheld has been rumored to be in the works for a while, Sony has provided no indication that such a system exists. Still, last week, it was revealed that the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro will soon get a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy mode</a> that will reduce performance to save power, which is believed to be a performance profile for this yet-to-be-detected handheld, so it seems increasingly</span>&nbsp;likely that a handheld system is indeed in development.</p>
<p>While Sony has yet to confirm if the PlayStation handheld is indeed in the works, Microsoft made part of its plans for the handheld market clear during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, a handheld gaming PC coming in a clear Xbox flavor. The company was reportedly also working on a full-blown handheld system, but plans were reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/">halted</a> to focus on improving the Windows 11 handheld gaming performance, which is lagging behind the performance offered by SteamOS.</p>

			<p><span>No other game developer dared to reveal their newest game at Summer Game Fest by teasing players three times with an anniversary message, followed by a sale announcement for previous titles in the series, and then ending the two-hour showcase with an actual world premiere look at their latest survival horror game. While Resident Evil Requiem’s initial reveal may have been cheapened by all the teasing beforehand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">the reveal</a> was worth it.</span></p>
<p><span>Following our&nbsp;</span><span>brief look</span>&nbsp;at <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, we were greeted behind closed doors with another look at the trailer, announced earlier in the week, along with the first sneak peek at gameplay for the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p><span>While Resident Evil VII: Biohazard’s connections to the Resident Evil universe were muted early on and left players wondering how it was connected to the legacy of S.T.A.R.S. and the Umbrella Corporation, Requiem starts by introducing the player character as Grace Ashcroft, a young FBI investigator and daughter of the late Alyssa Ashcroft, one of the varied protagonists from the Resident Evil Outbreak series (and eagle-eyed fans might recognize the byline as one of the reporters of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dulvey_Daily">The Dulvey Daily</a>, a newspaper for the local parish where the Baker family resides in Resident Evil VII Biohazard. Capcom aims for a “fresh, vulnerable perspective” on the Resident Evil series by introducing a character already haunted by a major family tragedy, yet not a fighter in the traditional sense, but rather a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span>The demo opened with Grace Ashcroft being suspended upside down on a hospital gurney with an IV in her right arm. The developers made a point to highlight Grace’s training in the FBI to try and stay cool under pressure through breathing techniques and self-talk to cool down. She then tries to tip the stretcher over to stop the blood from rushing down to her head, and uses the shards of a broken glass vial to cut her bindings free, all through an in-game cut scene before the gameplay transitions into a first-person perspective as Grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This section of Resident Evil Requiem takes place in an abandoned hospital, although it only appears to have been abandoned somewhat recently. There are still a bevvy of locked doors that mark a series’ long-running tradition, both ones with broken handles and others with elaborate door handles or stone carvings to indicate which key is needed. And it wouldn’t be a Resident Evil game without needing to replace fuses in a fuse box to turn on the lights or open an electronic shutter, so I’m proud to say that these puzzles are back once again. Grace isn’t one to have deep pockets on her, so she only has a modest eight-slot inventory to hold onto these key items, at least to start.</span></p>
<p><span>Grace Ashcroft doesn’t have the same combat training that Ethan Winters underwent between Resident Evil Biohazard and Village, so she instead will have to rely on more practical weapons, such as throwing empty bottles. A small UI tip showed both a power and radius for the bottle, so I would assume there would be a variety of these weapon types at her disposal. To navigate the darkened halls, Grace picked up a lighter with the same ornate emblems as one of the gates around the hospital, although we couldn’t make out what that symbol was.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of Resident Evil Requiem was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In a scene that will be all too familiar as players experience the horror for themselves, Grace is slain by this hulking monster as the screen fades away. The audience is reminded that this was merely the overture to their darkest symphony to date. Resident Evil Requiem's demo session ended with a quick continue back to moments before disaster and a cheeky peek at the options to turn on a third-person camera mode. Yes, while Capcom is leading with the first-person perspective of the past few titles, third-person gameplay will be available from the start, and you can even spin the camera around and see Grace’s face, unlike the enigmatic Ethan Winters for most of his adventures.</span></p>
<p><span>Resident Evil Requiem will be available on February 27th, 2026, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</span></p>
