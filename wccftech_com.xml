			<p>Following Randy Pitchford's social tease that the Borderlands 4 reveal would be coming soon, the official franchise page on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1866166006353449188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866166006353449188%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will be shown at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2024 show. The tweet also boasts how it will be the franchise's most ambitious installment to date.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom this year for a generic 2025 release window. Other than the confirmation that it will take place on a brand new planet, not much has been shared so far. The studio did provide fans with a few concept art <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a panel at PAX West 2024</a>, but those were mere tidbits.</p>
<p>The series certainly needs a bit of pick-me-up following the disastrous launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action adaptation.</a> Despite the presence of actors like Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, the film was a massive box office bomb (making only about a quarter of its $120 million budget back), receiving equally devastating reviews from critics and fans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the previous game in the series sold extremely well, surpassing 18 million units last year. Undoubtedly, Gearbox owner Take Two (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460 million acquisition from Embracer Group</a>) will try to match or even exceed those financial results with Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It seems like they're going all-in with The Game Awards 2024, anyway, as another heavy hitter of their 2025 lineup <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will also show a new trailer at the show. We're referring to Mafia: The Old Country, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. Developed by Hangar 13, it will function as a prequel, delving into the origins of the Mafia in the fictional Sicilian city of San Celeste.</p>
<p>Those rumors about a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big The Game Awards 2024 show</a> are taking shape. As a reminder, the show will go live on Thursday, December 12, at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be among the biggest video game launches of all time, if not the biggest, and its release window, which is still up in the air with a potential 2026 delay, is already influencing the video game industry as a whole.</p>
<p>In a new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today, it has been revealed that anticipation surrounding the game is so high that competing video game publishers are waiting as long as they can before committing to Fall 2025 release dates for their games, as they want to see if Grand Theft Auto 6 will indeed release next year or if it will slip into 2025, and want to launch their games as far from it as possible. This is far from surprising, considering how analysts expect it to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, which could have a massive impact on the entire industry, and not just in terms of release timings.</p>
<p>It has been some time since Rockstar Games discussed Grand Theft Auto 6. Back in May, publisher Take-Two confirmed that the game was still on track for a Fall 2025 release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S but has said nothing since. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">ambitious nature could make it slip into 2026</a>, but for the time being, the game's release window hasn't been changed.</p>
<p>Those who want to experience Grand Theft Auto 6 at its very best, however, will have to wait longer than everyone else, as a PC release, which is undoubtedly coming at some point, has yet to be officially confirmed. Compromises will likely be made on consoles, and even the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the game at <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">60 FPS</a> if the game is targeting 30 FPS on the base model, mostly due to CPU limitations.</p>
