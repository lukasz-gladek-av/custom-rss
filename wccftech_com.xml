			<p>Closing out the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 was the reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a sequel to last year's Black Ops 6, due out sometime later this year, set over four decades into the future after the events of the last campaign.</p>
<p>All we got was a teaser trailer and the reveal that this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2025-to-feature-six-fully-fledged-round-based-zombies-maps-rumor/">Call of Duty</a> is once again a new Black Ops title, but one notable fact missing in the teaser is that Call of Duty is, for at least another year, still launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of course, it'll also launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 is also the latest Call of Duty to add some celebrity star-power to its cast, with Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason, the game's protagonist. While the teaser doesn't show any gameplay or reveal any hints as to what's changing in this year's Call of Duty game, it does make it clear that the campaign will lean more into the fantastical, similar to what players saw in Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>"<em>Our official teaser sets the tone for players to embrace the madness that's incoming with Black Ops 7's story,</em>" Activision's head of publishing and marketing, Tyler Bahl, told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/call-duty-black-ops-7-reveal">Windows Central</a> in an interview.</p>
<p>"<em>Delivering consecutive Black Ops games also allows our teams the tremendous opportunity to tap not only into our own creativity but also embrace the shift from a '90s setting to the new 2035 future setting within our marketing</em>."</p>
<p>One interesting bit revealed in an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/xbox-games-showcase-2025-recap-everything-announced/"> Xbox Wire</a> post following the showcase is that the campaign will be playable entirely in co-op, and that it's once again Raven Software behind the campaign mode.</p>

<p>While Raven Software is leading up the campaign, the game's development is primarily being led by Treyarch. Though, as is the case with all Call of Duty games, several of the studios under Activision will be working on Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>This teaser was just the beginning of what will surely be a massive marketing campaign for Black Ops 7, with more to come later this summer. "<em>The full reveal of Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, so the community should be on the lookout for teases, clues, and the surprises that the Black Ops series is known for,</em>" Bahl said in the same aforementioned interview. "<em>It's an exciting time as we prepare for a new Call of Duty reveal, and the next great experience to come</em>."</p>
