			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' launch has been extremely successful in the United States, where it became the best-selling game of the month of February and the current best-selling game of the year in a single day of availability.</p>
<p>According to data shared today by Circana (NPD), the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM was the overall best-selling premium game in the United States, topping the sales charts of every platform it has released on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam - followed by two other February releases, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">Civilization VII</a>. While the game sold great on all platforms, it was a smashing success on Steam, as the PC ecosystem accounts for more than half of the title's total dollar sales.&nbsp; With the game also being the current best-selling game of the year in the United States, it definitely looks like the first proper, simultaneous PC and console release for the series paid off big time.</p>

That Monster Hunter Wilds has been a smashing success, there was no doubt, as CAPCOM itself reported to have sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">eight million copies in only three days</a>, becoming the fastest-selling game in the publisher's long history. A success that is completely deserved, as the game is, despite some shortcomings, incredibly fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>
