			<p>A limited Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition has been leaked in pictures<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1936165435164045812#m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> via X user Zuby_Tech</a> and might be very close to launch, at least <a href="https://www.gamesandwich.com/news/source-meta-will-announce-an-xbox-quest-3s-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Game Sandwich</a>, which reckons the branded VR device will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, June 24.</p>
<p>The report says the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will include a black and green headset with matching accessories, an Elite Strap, an Xbox wireless controller and a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Internally, it will have the same 128 GB standard system memory as the Meta Quest 3S. Pricing will be set at $399.</p>
<p>Meta officially&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-opens-up-quest-os-to-third-party-hardware-makers-asus-to-make-high-performance-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> its operating system to third-party hardware makers in April 2024. Back then, ASUS announced that it would craft a high-performance ROG VR headset, although we haven't received any further details. Alongside that announcement, Meta revealed it would release a limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been taking steps to bring Meta Quest users to the Xbox platform for a while. In late 2023, Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3-launches-on-october-10-with-asgards-wrath-2-bundled-xbox-cloud-gaming-coming-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became available on the VR headset</a>, allowing Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream games to their Meta Quest and experience them as if viewing a massive 2D screen. Games are streamed at 1080p (FullHD) resolution and 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>It's all part of Microsoft's grand plan to bring Xbox to virtually every device that has a screen and could run a game, including TVs, smartphones, and VR devices. Granted, it's unlikely that the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition could move the needle in any major way, but it is yet another in a series of initiatives that go in the same direction.</p>
