			<p>The first thing you notice about Compulsion Games' latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, might be its striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is its excellent storytelling.</p>
<p>That includes the writing and performances in the cutscenes and the notes you can discover that add more context to the story. That's why, beyond just doing it for the achievement, it is worth your time to try and find all of the 103 notes there are to find across the 14 chapters of South of Midnight's story.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find the 4 notes hiding in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 8</h2>
<p>After having to look out for 15 notes in Chapter 7, you'll be happy to know that Chapter 8 is a much easier time with only 4 notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Their Eyes Were Watching -&nbsp;</strong>You'll be able to find this note right at the beginning of the level, immediately after using a wind tunnel for the first time. When you land, it'll be waiting on a tree stump to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346-Weird Happenings -</strong> After using a wind tunnel for the second time in the level, head left when you land to find a Floof knot and this note lying on the ground.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346- Red Yarn</strong> - After finding the previous note, you'll have to clear some branches away to wall-run over a gap. When you reach the other side, on the right side of the path, you'll find some sunflowers with a tree stump next to them, where you'll find this note waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta 346 - Search Called Off</strong> - You'll find this note just after the first combat encounter of the level. Use the grapple hook to cross the gap after completing the encounter, and before heading into the cave blocked by wood and red yarn, this note will be on the ground on the right side of the path.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 8. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 57 notes by now. Only 46 more to find.</p>
