			<p>With G-Star 2024 scheduled to start in just two weeks at the usual venue (the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center), NEXON has shown off several trailers for its upcoming games, starting with The First Berserker: Khazan.</p>
<p>This intriguing Dungeon and Fighter spin-off is an action RPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught our attention at Gamescom</a> and then again during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent closed beta test</a>. Francesco De Meo wrote in his latest hands-on:</p>
<p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</em></p>
<p>Today, NEXON published the game's opening cinematic. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>

<p>The South Korean company also published a new gameplay trailer for Project Overkill, another game set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexons-overkill-is-a-3d-side-scrolling-arpg-set-in-the-dungeon-fighter-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in early 2021, it is a 3D sidescrolling action RPG powered by Unreal Engine technology. It has no release date yet.</p>

<p>Today, NEXON unveiled a brand new Dungeon and Fighter game. Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad is an open-world action RPG for PC, consoles and mobiles in which players will experience exhilarating battle action and a journey with various characters on the Arad continent.</p>

<p>The game developer also shared a brief new trailer for Vindictus: Defying Fate, a character action RPG based on the Mabinogi Heroes IP (just like the Vindictus MMO-lite game). Defying Fate is coming to PC and consoles, with an Alpha test scheduled to go live next Summer.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia and Karok Sneak Peek" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKZ_nIeVn1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, NEXON announced Project DX, a dinosaur-themed MMORPG based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durango-wild-lands-is-nexons-next-dino-themed-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durango: Wild Lands</a> IP. Codenamed Project DX, it promises an immersive story with unique characters and battles with giant dinosaurs against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world. Let's hope it won't be confined to mobile like the predecessor.</p>

<p>The publisher might share more footage and information when G-Star actually begins. Stay tuned.</p>
