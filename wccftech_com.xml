			<p>In Ninja Gaiden 4, Yakumo can use, at the end of the campaign, five different weapons all coming with unique properties and attacks, which are further expanded by their Bloodraven forms.While all of these weapons have their own unique uses, and are fully viable to complete the game at any difficulty, using some of them is going to make your life much easier. Here are the best of them.</p>

<h2 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Dark Dragon Blade is the best weapon in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-dark-dragon-blade">Dark Dragon Blade</h3>



<p>The Dark Dragon Blade is undoubtedly the <strong>overall best weapon</strong> Yakumo can use. Its damage output is only slightly lower than Ryu's Dragon Blade, but it combines that power with exceptional <strong>ease of use</strong> and high utility.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage &amp; Speed:</strong> Features very high base damage and one of the fastest light attacks in its Bloodraven/Shadow-gleam form.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Utility &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Offers great utility with its circle motion input skills. Has an unblockable launcher to easily set up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Izuna Drops</strong> and a powerful area-of-effect (AOE) ranged attack (B/Circle) in Shadow-gleam mode.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Defense:</strong> The fast Shadow-gleam form light attack can reliably stop most Power Attacks, making it excellent for boss battles as well.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> The only true downside is the time required to unlock it, as you<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-ultimate-guide-dark-dragon-blade-unlock/"> must complete the game once and clear all of the Boss Trials challenges</a>. This effort, however, is well worth it.</p>



<h3 id="h-kage-hiruko">Kage-Hiruko</h3>



<p>Being the only ranged weapon in the game, the Kage-Hiruko grants great long-range combat capabilities that are extremely effective in the hands of expert players.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ranged &amp; Launchers:</strong> Excellent for long-range engagements and features a wealth of launcher attacks, including a quick light-heavy attack (X/Square - Y/Triangle) laucher string.</li>



<li><strong>Unique</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flying Swallow:</strong> Has a unique version of the ever-useful Flying Swallow technique that also functions as a launcher.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Excellent Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The Nocturnal Rain AOE attack (A/Cross - X/Square) is massively useful, launching multiple enemies in a wide radius. The fast Bloodraven form light attack is perfect for stopping Power Attacks and break guards at all ranges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">:</strong> The Kage-Hiruko loses out to the Dark Dragon Blade due to lower damage and moveset complexity.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Takeminakata twin blades are balanced weapons that hold their own at any difficulty level</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-takeminakata"><strong>Takeminakata</strong></h3>



<p>The twin blades are Yakumo's starting weapon, but they should absolutely not be dismissed. While their damage output is only acceptable, the weapon's strength lies in its <strong>incredible versatility and utility</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Provides quick access to multiple launchers and a handy area-of-effect (AOE) attack (circle motion - Y/Triangle).</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Offers amazing crowd control in Bloodraven Form. This includes the two heavy aerial attacks, which are easier to charge than ground attacks, and the Rising Stance: Spin technique (A/Cross - X/Square), which can decimate multiple enemies in a single strike while in Berserk State.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides</strong>: While utility trumps damage, the Takeminakata's lower damage makes it a less reliable choice at high difficulty levels, where fights must be ended quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-magatsuhi">Magatsuhi</h3>



<p>Heavily reminiscent of the glorious Lunar Staff in Ninja Gaiden 2, the Magatsuhi staff is a solid weapon that deals <strong>good damage</strong> via its ground multi-hit combos.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Thanks to the staff's hitboxes, these combos work well as crowd control attacks, hitting enemies behind and to the sides of Yakumo, making it invaluable against enemies that swarm Yakumo in greater numbers.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The massive hammer into which the staff turns into in Bloodraven mode has surprisingly fast and strong attacks. By pressing A/Cross, Yakumo can also launch high in the air to escape pressure and unleash damaging downward AOE attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong>: The Magatsuhi staff doesn't have easy access to a basic launcher attacker, mostly forcing a grounded playstyle. Its most damaging combos also require long execution times which are often interrupted at Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Yatousen isn't a bad weapon, but every other weapon in the game does what it does, and better</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-yatousen">Yatousen</h3>



<p>The Yatousen rapier is an interesting weapon characterized by its exceptional <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mobility and speed</strong>. However, its overall usability is extremely limited by a few core design conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mobility: Many of the Yatousen combos have great mobility, which can help Yakumo get out of danger while keeping up the pressure</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides:</strong> The lack of a quick launcher to set up Izuna Drops, the low attack power in base form and the limitations of Bloodraven form, which requires Yakumo to stand still to deal max damage in any combo string, make it a situational weapon that works best against bosses only in Bloodraven form.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for its GeForce graphics cards. This one is optimized for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, by far the biggest release scheduled this month. The game will launch on November 14, with Activision <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding itself in a bit of a pinch</a> following the releases of two highly successful shooters: Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The new Game Ready driver is also optimized for Europa Universalis V, the latest entry (following a hiatus of twelve years) in Paradox Interactive's premier grand strategy game. Europa Universalis V is out today on PC and will support DLSS Super Resolution with the option to enable the latest transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Game Ready driver is optimized for Ubisoft's Anno 117: Pax Romana, a real-time strategy game with city building elements. The game will debut on November 13 with support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Wreckreation, a massive open world racing game focused on destruction, launched a week ago with support for DLSS Super Resolution and optional transformer model via the NVIDIA app. Earlier in October, indie developer Jaw Drop Games released Deathground, a co-op horror game where players desperately try to survive against dinosaurs. Deathground supports DLSS 4 with Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Square Enix will update Final Fantasy VII Rebirth today with DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, accelerating frame rates in the popular action RPG for owners of GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs. The game already features DLSS Super Resolution, but it will now be upgradable to the new transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, on November 6, Finnish developer Channel37 will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch The Last Caretaker in early access</a>. This is a first-person survival crafting game where players step into the role of a machine tasked with securing humanity's future after a cataclysm that has flooded the Earth. Players will navigate a dangerous ocean world to salvage technology that could save humankind. The game will support the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warframe/">Warframe</a> will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next year, but the longer wait will be worth it, according to the developer.</p>



<p>In a new livestream, Digital Extremes confirmed that the Switch 2 native version of their popular game will launch sometime in 2026, disappointing those who had hoped the game would debut on the current-generation Nintendo console before the end of 2025. Although a precise release window hasn't been confirmed, the developer did specifiy they will release the game as early as they possibly can in the new year.</p>



<p>No matter how long the wait will be, it looks like it will be worth it. During the livestream, Digital Extremes shared new footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running in handheld mode with NVIDIA DLSS on, and it looks quite promising. Unfortunately, the developer didn't discuss specifics such as resolution and frame rate targets, so there's still a lot we don't know about this new version of the game.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Those who wish to play Warframe on the Nintendo Switch 2 and cannot wait for the native version to be released have the option of playing the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nintendo.com/it-it/Giochi/Giochi-scaricabili-per-Nintendo-Switch/Warframe-1471859.html?srsltid=AfmBOopA0r6U6DlySfK3HhSAXcOWeZm6NLLExXaaaCbPqv7KSUGTVJuy">original Switch release</a> via backward compatibility. This version of the game doesn't look or run great, however, so those looking to have the best possible experience will inevitabily have to wait for the new version to launch. Hopefully, it won't take too long.</p>
