			<p>Earlier this week, renowned modder PureDark <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/indiana-jones-01-118058876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an AMD FSR 3 mod for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As usual, the mod is locked behind being a subscriber on his Patreon, and even PureDark told his community:</p>
<p><em>Note that the devs have announced that future updates will include official FSR3 implementation. Think twice before subscribing!</em></p>
<p>Indeed, developer MachineGames confirmed alongside the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second title update</a> that AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution would be added in a future patch. However, they didn't specifically state whether that would also include the frame generation component, which is indeed available in PureDark's mod and makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Not only that, it even works on portable devices like Valve's Steam Deck. YouTuber Grown Up Gaming tested it and noticed that the performance went from 20-25 frames per second to around 40 frames per second with the upscaling set to Quality. Lowering that to Performance mode provides another 10 frames or so, but at that point, the game doesn't look very good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steam Deck Indiana Jones and the Great Circle FSR 3 Frame Generation Mod #steamdeck #fsr3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BE40VHIbs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Granted, it is a miracle Indiana Jones and the Great Circle even works on the Steam Deck. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system requirements</a> technically include hardware ray tracing support, and we all know that the Deck's ray tracing performance is not its strongest suit, to say the least.</p>
<p>It's certainly not like I would like to play this game. If I absolutely had to do it on the go, I'd prefer using GeForce NOW to stream it via cloud and still get ray tracing features and smooth performance. PureDark's mod will probably be more useful to all those desktop users who do not own an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU, providing a way to essentially double the frame rate for free.</p>
<p>Whether you plan to use it or not, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is absolutely worth playing, as I explained in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>At least one story DLC titled The Order of the Giants is on its way, though there's no release window yet.</p>

<h3>Bigger Waterfall-Shaped Cushion with Seat Depth Adjustment<strong><br>
</strong></h3>
<p>The large waterfall-shaped cushion the chair is packed with helps users feel more comfortable, especially during longer sittings, due to the pressure it relieves from the thighs and improves overall circulation.

<h3>Complete Control in One Handle</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro comes with enhanced functionality as the operations can be controlled through one handle only, which is placed on the right-hand side of the chair. Real-life adjustments can give users a seamless experience through an interrupted workflow by effortlessly adapting to various needs.

<h2>Sihoo Doro C300 Ergonomic Office Chair</h2>
<p>Sihoo Doro C300 is the company's selling product, and if you look at the design, you will find the Doro C300 and the Doro C300 Pro chair to be almost identical, with minor differences only. The product is well received by users, especially those who seek good value for money. Some users who have shared their experience with the chair even went ahead and painted the Pro model as merely a refreshed version rather than offering some major Pro model upgrades. The Doro C300 is perfect for users who are looking for a chair that provides all-day support and helps with chronic back pain with effective lumbar support.</p>
<p>The listed price of the Doro C300 Ergonomic Chair on the<a href="https://sihoooffice.com/products/sihoo-doro-c300-ergonomic-office-chair" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener"> official website</a> is<b> $399.99</b> for the black model, but the promotional offer brings the price to only<b> $239.99</b>.

<h3>Wide Multi-Adjustable Headrest</h3>
