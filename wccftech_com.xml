			<p>An ad for <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> has been <strong>banned in the UK</strong> after the <strong>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)</strong> deemed that it was "<em>irresponsible and offensive</em>" for centring around humour that was "<em>generated by the humiliation and the implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration</em>" of a man in the ad. </p>



<p>Spotted by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd831elpz5o">BBC</a>, the ad in question is part of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's 'Replacers' ad campaign, which featured Hollywood actors like <strong>Terry Crews</strong>, <strong>Nikki Glaser</strong>, and <strong>Peter Stromare</strong>. While there are several 'Replacers' ads, the one that got banned depicts Glaser and Stromare's characters as replacement airport security officers filling in for the actual officers who are too wrapped up in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to be at work.</p>



<p>When a man travelling steps up for his security check, Glaser and Stromare's characters are seen to take advantage of him, with Glaser seemingly stealing his watch, followed by Stromare stating that he had been "<em>randomly selected to be <strong>manhandled</strong></em>," before telling him that he'll need to remove his clothes, "<em>everything but the shoes</em>." Glaser's character then follows up with "<em>time for the puppet show</em>," before Stromare's character puts a body scanning device in the man's mouth, telling him to bite down on it because "<strong><em>she's going in dry</em>."</strong></p>

<p>Outside of the ad being available on YouTube, per the BBC's report, the ad ran ahead of the game's launch in November 2025 on Channel 5 and ITV, after which the ASA received at least nine complaints that the ad "<em>trivialized sexual violence</em>."</p>



<p>For <strong>Activision Blizzard's</strong> part, the company stated that the ad was reviewed by Clearcast before it aired, and that it wasn't aired around programming that would have appealed to children and youth under 16. It added that the situation shown was a "<em>deliberately implausible, parodic scenario</em>," that the humour referred more to the man's discomfort, and that it did not sexualize the invasive search. The company also pointed out that the search is not shown and that the ad does not include any explicit imagery.</p>



<p>That didn't fly with the ASA. While the organization acknowledged the lack of any explicit imagery, it did not come to the conclusion that the humour came from the man's discomfort, instead concluding that it was from "<em>the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration</em>." The ad will not run again in the UK in its current form, though, now that Black Ops 7 has been out for the last few months, it's worth considering that Activision may simply sunset the ad campaign altogether, only leaving them up on YouTube.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that the ASA isn't the only one that came to the conclusion that the humour was centred around the man in the ad being non-consensually penetrated in public. A quick look at the YouTube comments under the ad shows you plenty of viewers got the 'joke,' and several wondered what the ad even accomplished in reference to making anyone want to buy or play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Losing an argument with the ASA isn't the only thing Activision lost with regard to Black Ops 7. The latest entry in the annualized shooter series also lost to <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> on the sales charts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">both at launch</a> and overall for 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">when looking at the best-selling games in the US.</a></p>



<p>The game's launch was received so poorly that the team released a statement <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">vowing that it would no longer release back-to-back games in the same sub-series</a>. So, no more Black Ops 6 followed by Black Ops 7 runs of back-to-back Call of Duty titles. Instead, we can expect the back and forth of a Black Ops title one year and a Modern Warfare title the next.</p>

However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sony</strong> has plans in place to minimize the effects of these high component costs, though it's definitely not good news for all current <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</em></strong> owners.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sony-plans-to-minimize-effect-of-rising-playstation-5-memory-costs-by-boosting-software-and-network-service-revenue-according-to-cfo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Automaton</strong></a>, during <strong><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_sonypre.pdf">Sony's latest earnings call</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CFO Lin Tao</strong> addressed the current situation, stating that the company has secured the memory needed for the end-of-the-year sales season in the next fiscal year. However, the company plans to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"minimize"</em> the impact of rising <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM prices</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"monetizing the installed base"</em></strong> while continuing to grow <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">software and network services revenue</strong>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this doesn't sound like good news for the <strong>92.2 million current PlayStation 5 owners</strong>. While a direct price increase for games is unlikely, given the goal of growing software volume, the mention of <strong>network services revenue</strong> suggests that an<strong> increase in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-headlines-february-2026-ps-plus-extra-games-supported-by-a-few-strong-indies/">PlayStation Plus</a>&nbsp;subscription prices could be on the table</strong>. This would impact the vast majority of the user base, as a subscription is required to access <strong>online multiplayer</strong> for most titles.</p>



<p>While any price increase is unfortunate, dealing with soaring component costs driven largely by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">AI-fueled chip crisis</strong> is the biggest challenge every hardware manufacturer will face for the next few years. The situation is reportedly impacting future systems as well, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6</em> could launch as late as 2028 or 2029</a></strong> in the hopes that prices return to a more reasonable state.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> of <strong>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</strong> at The Game Awards 2025 was a nice surprise for all those gamers who were dearly missing a Star Wars racing game. The last one to be released was <strong>Star Wars: Racer Revenge</strong>, launched in <strong>February 2002</strong> for the <strong>PlayStation 2</strong> console. It's been an age, at least as far as gaming goes.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the developers at <strong>Fuse Games</strong> even <a href="https://wccftech.com/yes-star-wars-galactic-racer-has-podracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>podracing would indeed be featured in the game</strong>, alongside other vehicle types. Then, last week, a new promising gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/now-this-is-podracing-star-wars-galactic-racer-gameplay-debuted-at-february-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was shared during the State of Play broadcast</a>.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to IGN</a>, Fuse Games founder and CEO <strong>Matt Webster</strong> and creative director <strong>Kieran Crimmins</strong> have revealed more details about approaching Lucasfilm to make the game and also confirmed that <strong>there are no current plans to adopt a Season Pass system</strong>, with Webster saying <strong>he immediately connects Season Passes to free-to-play games</strong>, while Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a premium offering.</p>



<p><em><strong>Webster:</strong>&nbsp;No. This is a premium release, right? We have our campaign and we have arcade mode and we have multiplayer, and it's a self-contained thing. But what we also recognize is that the landscape of Star Wars evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more Star Wars or new Star Wars over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post launch is going to look like, that's not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that's not what we are making.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Crimmins:</strong>&nbsp;Our mindset right now is a premium release, to try and get an amazing experience out the box. Obviously we wouldn't close the door to doing something later, but that isn't what we are really thinking about right now. We just want it to be the very best game it can be, and we want it to be complete when it comes out.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly good news for everyone interested in playing Star Wars: Galactic Racer without having to purchase an extra Season Pass. Of course, if the game does well, <strong>Fuse Games will probably release some DLCs</strong>, but that's an entirely different matter.</p>



<p>In the interview, the developers from Fuse Games also <strong>revealed a unique boost system</strong> that they hope will make their racing game even more tactical. Star Wars: Galactic Racer features a two-phase boost, with the second phase called a <strong>ramjet</strong>, which is extremely fast, but also generates a lot of heat. Eventually, <strong>the player's vehicle could even explode if they're not careful enough</strong>, and the tracks will play a part, too: racing over lava will increase the heat even further.</p>



<p>The game has no release date beyond a <strong>generic 2026</strong>. It will be out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>
