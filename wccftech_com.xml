After months of updates, the popular <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FromSoftware</strong> hardcore action RPG is now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully playable</strong> thanks to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ShadPS4 emulator</strong>, even on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dated hardware</strong></a> and handheld systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-12-6-massive-performance-boost-bloodborne/">Steam Deck</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Emulation, however, still isn't perfect, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">online features</strong> are not accessible - but that may be about to change. A new video shared on YouTube by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube">George Moralis</a></strong>, one of the emulator's lead developers, shows <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloodborne</em> running on PC with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online features enabled</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">early technical test</strong>, and many issues still need to be ironed out, it's hard not to get excited about the prospect of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">co-op play</strong>, searching <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">glyph Chalice Dungeons</strong>, and accessing the asynchronous features such as messages and bloodstains that make FromSoftware's titles so unique.

<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say. According to George Moralis, the development team is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=Ugx0oiPx3VLoeDEw0VB4AaABAg.ARJJ8ekVjhrARJN3dkWPbQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examining several options</a></strong>, including <strong>dedicated community servers</strong> or <strong>local servers</strong>. One thing, however, is certain: users playing on the emulated version will <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=UgzvNpnDQCtzxPeQ-fd4AaABAg.ARJM4Pn3JqpARJMu_zF1QS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be able to connect to Sony's official servers</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Besides perfecting <em>Bloodborne's</em> emulation, the <strong>ShadPS4 development team</strong> is continuing to expand the list of <strong>PlayStation 4 exclusives</strong> playable on PC. More information on the emulator's progress can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/"><strong>official website</strong>.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">Back in October, a rumour popped up</a> claiming that Warhorse Studios was working on a remaster of the first <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> game. There wasn't a lot to go off, since the rumour came from a lone source on Reddit, and while this source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">bertik11</a>, has previously been reliable about unreleased information from Warhorse Studios, it was still worth taking the news with a huge grain of salt.</p>



<p>That's still true, of course, though bertik11 has now added to his previous claim. They now specify that the remaster will arrive in February 2026, and that while players might've been hopeful for what a remaster of a game that is now seven years old (soon to be eight) at the time of this writing will look like, we shouldn't expect too much.</p>



<p>"<em>Two months ago I wrote about the upgrade of the first Kingdom Come and new game. Today I wanna share info about upcoming upgrade for next gen consoles</em>," bertik11 began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/">in a post on the GamingLeaksandRumors Reddit</a>. "<em>From what I’ve heard, a remaster of the original Kingdom Come is supposedly coming in February. Don’t expect too much, because as far as I’ve heard, it’s just going to be a port from PC. It won’t bring anything groundbreaking or entirely new — it’ll mostly just be a port for the new consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Again, this is all still just stemming from one unknown source who has previously been right when it comes to information on Warhorse Studios. Warhorse has not officially announced that it is making a remaster of the first Kingdom Come game, nor has it acknowledged its future plans now that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">is out, and all of its DLCs are available</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it would make perfect sense for Warhorse to work on an update like this, something to bolster the first game for current-gen consoles, and to capitalize on the success its sequel has enjoyed all year. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of the top-selling new games on Steam for 2025</a> and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominees for multiple awards, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</a>. </p>



<p>It's also high on end-of-year lists for several publications, including Wccftech, as we have it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Best Games of 2025</a> list,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"> Best Role-Playing Games</a> list, and even its DLC Mysteria Ecclesiae on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2025-expanding-the-fun/">Best DLC/Expansions</a> list. All this to say that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been one of 2025's defining titles, so it makes perfect sense for Warhorse to try and keep the series in players' minds by inviting them to return to the original.</p>



<p>Though if bertik11 is correct that the remaster will be closer to a port of the PC version to current-gen platforms instead of a deeper remaster, then how Warhorse handles it will be a huge element to how it is received. If it is just a port of the PC version, but there's no upgrade path for current owners, and they have to buy the full game all over again, or even worse, it's released as an entirely new game that everyone - PC players included - will have to buy again if they want all of the new graphical features, then that likely won't go over well with players who played and loved the game back in 2018. Nor will those who got into the series through the sequel be too enthused.</p>



<p>Of course, it's Warhorse's right to make those decisions if it likes, but it may go against capitalizing on the success of the sequel. Regardless, this whole rumor might not even be accurate, so we'll have to wait and see what happens in 2026.</p>
