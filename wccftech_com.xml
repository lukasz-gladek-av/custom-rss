			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod is now available for download, introducing ultrawide support to the newly released PC version of the game.</p>
<p>The current work-in-progress version of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix mod, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, aims to improve the PC version of the game over time by introducing a variety of improvements. As of now, the mod only introduces ultrawide support by supporting any aspect rations with corrected FOV and centered 16:9 HUD. As the mod is still in a very early version, issues are expected.</p>
<p>Among some of the essential settings that the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth lacks is in-game FOV settings. Thankfully, user dammy63 from the FearLess Cheat Engine forums came to the rescue with a <a href="https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?p=389117#p389117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Engine table</a> that allows users to change the game's FOV value. As the modding tools evolve, a proper mod should also be released for those who do not want to use Cheat Engine for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight.&nbsp;</em></p>
