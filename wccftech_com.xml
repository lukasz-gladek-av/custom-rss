			<p>With tomorrow's update, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added to Embark's free-to-play shooter game The Finals, which recently saw the beginning of Season 6 and the arrival of Team Deathmatch as a permanent mode for Quickplay. The game already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-f2p-fps-from-embark-supports-nvidia-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the addition of Multi Frame Generation will boost frame rates even further for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This will be especially useful for those who play with RTXGI enabled.</p>
<p>An update is also adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. Like The Finals, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the new patch unlocks even higher frame rates for RTX 50 owners.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched last week on PC. Despite NVIDIA originally claiming it would include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, it didn't really make it to the final game, as we explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our report</a>. In today's DLSS update, NVIDIA did not refer to that at all, mentioning only Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. They did say the NVIDIA app now supports overriding Super Resolution from the old CNN model to the new transformer model.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new game due to launch on Steam Early Access this Friday will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827230/Wild_Assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Assault</a>, a third-person class-based PvP multiplayer shooter game developed by Combat Cat. In this title, players will select from several anthropomorphic heroes featuring unique abilities based on the original animal that inspired them.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, the Unreal Engine 5 powered game runs 5X faster on average when activating DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, can reach up to 415 frames per second at 4K with all settings maxed out and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">The Nintendo Switch 2</a> will obviously not be able to offer the same visual quality as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but so far, it's been shown that it is doing a pretty good job of turning in PS4-level visuals with some select enhancements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcasts, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> compared the gameplay footage of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Hogwarts Legacy, and Elden Ring running on Nintendo Switch shown during last week's Direct with PlayStation 4 footage, highlighting some interesting findings.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 is comparable to the PlayStation 4 version in terms of resolution and general image quality, but the game benefits from the lighting changes introduced in the Intergrade version, which is not available on Sony's previous-generation console, resulting in much better visuals in some scenarios. Hogwarts Legacy's case is even more interesting, as the game looks somewhat better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on PlayStation 4 with a much sharper and less aliased image despite the lower resolution, 720p vs 1080 upscaled with AMD FSR 1, which suggests that the Switch 2 version may be using a different temporal upscaling solution that returns better image quality.</p>
<p>Of the three games, Elden Ring on Nintendo Switch 2 is the game that looks the closest to the PlayStation 4 version, sporting a similar resolution and only slightly higher shadow drawing distance, although the comparison was limited by the bad quality footage available and the difficulty of recreating similar shots. These early comparisons not only highlight how the upcoming console can deliver PS4-level visuals but also how it can deliver better ones, not only because of more modern hardware but also because late ports give the developers the chance to make different choices that can lead to better results, as the Alien Isolation Switch port highlighted a while back by sporting a different image treatment with TAA over the other console versions which delivered better image quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver significantly better experiences in multiplatform ports than base PlayStation 4 thanks to the console's 120 Hz screen. Up until now, 40 FPS modes and HDR support have been considered as some sort of "bonus" modes since 120 Hz panels with HDR support are not standardized, but the Nintendo Switch 2 screen does, meaning that it's very likely we will see 40 FPS modes and HDR support frequently in games. With the console potentially being used more in handheld mode, the 120 Hz is a massive boon, as more advanced ports will have a hard time hitting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution, making a 720p resolution game running at 40 FPS in handheld mode a much better experience than running at 30 FPS.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5th.</p>
