<p>If you've played this game before and plan on picking up the remastered version, it will still have the same story that you loved, but now it will look better than ever, as it was rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. As a result, the Simulation world you explore is now more detailed than ever, introducing enhanced textures, lighting, and environmental design to upgrade the experience of the original Talos Principle experience.</p>
<p>Alongside the game, you'll also get to experience the acclaimed expansion, Road to Gehenna, where you'll get the opportunity to play through the new chapter, In the Beginning. This is a brand-new addition that dives into the beginning of the Simulation, where new layers are added to the complex story of The Talos Principle.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy the head-scratching puzzles that are featured in The Talos Principle, there will be a brand new Puzzle Editor, which allows creative minds to create new puzzles for players to take on, as well as new worlds to explore.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether this game is for you and you're on PC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a demo</a> for The Talos Principle: Reawakened currently available on Steam. This demo will give you access to a medieval environment where there are plenty of puzzles and challenges to undertake. The puzzles available in the demo have been cherry-picked to showcase some of the key mechanics that are utilized in the game. This includes laser connectors, pressure plates, and force-field jammers.</p>
<p>Along with this, you will be given the opportunity to try out the fully-featured Puzzle Editor, where you can build your own worlds and create your own challenges for other players to take on, giving control back to the dedicated modding community.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened will fully launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on April 10.</p>
