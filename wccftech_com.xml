			<p>Once again, Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without that artist's permission and putting it in their games, this time with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Artist Antireal posted on <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">X</a> that the Marathon alpha is "<em>covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,</em>" with design comparisons showing the assets were essentially copied.</p>
<p>"<em>Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade,</em>" they continued, while posting even more evidence, "<em>but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email. In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitizing my designs while I struggle to make a living.</em>"</p>

<p>Bungie confirmed their error from the <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">MarathonDevTeam X account</a>, which has a significantly smaller following than the main <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">Marathon account</a> for the game and the main <a href="https://x.com/Bungie">Bungie</a> account. It was a mistake made by the Marathon development team, so it makes sense to have an account that speaks for that team being the one to speak up, but it has the air of Bungie owning up to the mistake with a whisper, instead of with its full voice.</p>
<p>"<em><span>We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used</span></em><span> in-game</span>," the post on the MarathonDevTeam account reads.</p>
<p>"<em><span>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred.</span> <span>We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to</span> Antireal </em><em><span>to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>This is the fourth time Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without giving them proper credit: first in <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587">2021</a>, then again in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-says-it-will-compensate-and-credit-artist-whose-work-was-mistakenly-used-in-this-weeks-major-destiny-2-cutscene/">2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">2024</a>, and now once again in 2025.</p>
<p>"<em><span>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist</span></em><span> <em>contributions,</em>" the MarathonDevTeam account continued.</span></p>
<p>"<em><span>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</span></em>"</p>

<p>In response to a separate question about the assets being lifted, Antireal confirmed that artists from Bungie, including the Marathon franchise art director <a href="https://x.com/josephacross">Joseph Cross</a>, followed <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923083432713650246">them on X for years</a>, though Antireal had previously never interacted with Cross or any of the Bungie artists who followed them.</p>
<p>For the fourth time running, it's clear that Bungie has a major issue with its art pipeline. That these mistakes continue to happen is, frankly, ludicrous, and it only makes you wonder where <a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">other issues might lie</a> in its creative process.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has finally put to bed a bit of confusion players had about the Nintendo Switch 2. The console supports variable refresh rate (VRR) while in handheld mode, but Nintendo has officially clarified that it does <strong>not</strong> support VRR while in docked mode.</p>
<p>The confusion began when, after the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 at the beginning of April, Nintendo's websites in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">all mentioned that VRR was supported</a> in docked mode. It was then removed from the US and Canadian websites, but kept on the UK and EU websites. The mention of VRR being supported in docked mode was later <a href="https://x.com/oliemack/status/1912925904046899619">removed</a> from the UK and EU websites as well.</p>
<p>So did it support VRR in docked mode, or didn't it? The removal seemed to suggest that it didn't, but Nintendo had yet to provide a clear response.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">Nintendo Life</a>, they finally provided that clear response and apologized for the mistake of publishing it on their websites in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only. The incorrect information was initially published on the Nintendo Switch 2 website, and we apologize for the error</em>," the statement reads.</p>
<p>When asked if VRR support for docked mode would be added in a future update, Nintendo replied, "<em>We have nothing to announce on this topic</em>."</p>
<p>A disappointing end to this saga, but an end for now, nonetheless. It's always possible that Nintendo is working on adding VRR support for docked mode for a future firmware update, but at least for launch, we know that VRR is a handheld-only feature.</p>
