			<p>The PC version of GTA Online will be updated sometime next year with features introduced in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_community-update-20241101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> shared online today outlining what's coming to the game in the next few weeks, Rockstar Games confirmed there are plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X features of the game to the PC version next year. These features include ray tracing support, texture and draw distance upgrades, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, enhanced anti-aliasing and motion blur, improved explosions and fire, and more.</p>
<p>With GTA VI coming next year, it will be very interesting to see how Rockstar Games will handle GTA Online. Still, for the time being, it seems like updates and new content won't stop coming anytime soon, with more coming this December and beyond. The game's continued support is hardly surprising, considering it's still extremely popular, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/">last month</a>, over 400,000 players logged into the game to play the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival Mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>
