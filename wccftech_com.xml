			<p>In 2024, after years of seemingly turning a blind eye, <strong>Nintendo</strong> brought the DMCA takedown hammer hard on Switch emulators like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryujinx</a></strong>. Despite the significant blow, however, it was far from the end of the Nintendo Switch emulator scene. Ryujinx and Yuzu forks are still available, and brand new emulators like <strong>Eden</strong> and <strong>Citron</strong>, just to name two, have emerged over time. Nintendo's latest big release, <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-runs-well-on-pc-emulators-can-even-be-played-in-stereo-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately playable on those Switch emulators</a></strong>.</p>



<p>On Friday, though, the Switch emulator scene suffered another scare as Nintendo <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/comment/o51du26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a new DMCA takedown notice</a></strong> targeting the GitHub pages of most remaining emulators, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Citron</li>



<li>Eden</li>



<li>Kenji-NX</li>



<li>MeloNX</li>



<li>Pine</li>



<li>Pomelo</li>



<li>Ryubing</li>



<li>Ryujinx</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Sudachi</li>



<li>Sumi</li>



<li>Suyu</li>



<li>Yuzu</li>
</ul>



<p>The Citron website <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be dead</a>, and the same goes for <a href="https://melonx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeloNX</a>. However, many of the other Switch emulators are still normally available, including Eden, currently the most popular one. In Eden's Discord, one of the project managers sent the following message on Friday:</p>



<p><em>Nintendo issued a DMCA takedown request against our Releases repository, hosted at https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases. At the time we're unsure what exactly will happen to that repository (or when anything will happen), but the most likely scenario is that it's removed and you won't be able to access our stable releases on GitHub anymore. Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page. Not the source code, not our Actions workflow, nothing on our self-hosted Git instance, not even our development PR/Master/Nightly builds. The source code is always available at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden, and releases are also mirrored at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/releases. Our development will continue as always!</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, a new build (v0.2.0-rc1) <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.2.0-rc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was uploaded yesterday to the GitHub Releases page</a>, where downloads are still available. So, I reached out to the project managers to find out what was going on, and they told me <strong>they're fighting the takedown notice</strong> with a proper argument that Eden's repository <strong>does not infringe any laws or GitHub's hosting policies</strong>.</p>



<p>I then asked Eden founder Camille LaVey <span>whether the goal was to continue&nbsp;<strong>even if the DMCA takedown succeeded</strong></span> and removed their GitHub Releases page. Here's his reply:</p>



<p><em>Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we're never sure of what the future can bring, so we're always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep you posted on what happens to Switch emulators after the latest Nintendo crackdown. Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>The next game directed by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>, the Game Director behind 2007's <strong>God of War II</strong> and 2018's <strong>God of War</strong>, wasn't shown at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 State of Play</a>. However, according to two of the most reliable insiders, it is targeting a <strong>Summer reveal</strong> ahead of a <strong>tentative 2027 release</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NatetheHate</strong> <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2022409747539071233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted as much on X</a>, while adding that he will probably be able to share more information about the project in the future:</p>



<p><em>Cory is working on his own project and it remains unannounced. I'll share more when I can. We will hear about it before 2027. My expectation is around Summer.</em> <em>Unless a major delay happens, the game will be out in 2027.</em></p>



<p>Another renowned insider, <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <strong>corroborated this </strong>on the ResetEra gaming board, where someone surmised that Cory Barlog's game might be targeting 2028 while a smaller team prepares for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly announced <strong>God of War remake trilogy</strong></a>. However, the insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151277215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>Not that far (barring any delays, of course).</em> <em>Like I said, given the quarter they're targeting, I do expect that [it will be announced this year]. Probably May State of Play or the summer Keighleys (SGF). As of now, I don't know yet. If not by then, then they've either pushed the release out further or doing a shorter reveal to release.</em></p>



<p>In September 2021, Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> he wouldn't direct <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, leaving that role to <strong>Eric Williams</strong>. He was still credited as Creative Director and Producer for that game, but he also began working on another game that, <strong>several years later, remains shrouded in secrecy</strong>. There have been rumors that it could take place in a sci-fi setting, but it's nothing solid.</p>



<p>The only solid rumor came in July 2025 from Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>the project was going well</strong> and that while it is not technically a new intellectual property, <strong>it might feel like it</strong>. This appears to be a hint that Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica are <strong>possibly working on a PlayStation IP that is being revived</strong> after a long slumber. If the insiders are correct, we're only a few months away from the announcement, anyway. Stay tuned.</p>
