			<p>It's not long until Civilization VII releases, with just 11 days to go until the<a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/"> full release of the title</a>. However, those who have the Deluxe or Founders Edition of Civilization VII will get access to the game from 6 February. To get people excited about the long-term plans of Civilization VII, Firaxis has posted the roadmap for the game so you can see what to expect for the rest of 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>March will be getting some significant updates, with the addition of Ada Lovelace as a leader, as well as Carthage and Great Britain added as two new Civilizations. There will also be four new Natural Wonders added to the game that players will be able to find when exploring and uncovering the map. Along with those smaller updates, there will also be some major updates that add new events to the game. This includes the Natural Wonder Battle, the Marvelous Mountains event, and even more Natural Wonders, such as Mount Everest and the Bermuda Triangle. There will also be the addition of Simon Bolivar as a leader, as well as Bulgaria and Nepal as civilizations.</p>
<p>All of the updates taking place in March will be added to the game as free content for all players to access, allowing players to experience a bit more of a shake-up to the game before paid DLC starts being released.</p>
<p>After March, the next updates will be released between April and September. This update collection will be called Right to Rule, and will add two new leaders, four more civilizations, and four World Wonders. There will also be new events and challenges for people to enjoy if you're someone who likes a challenge when playing Civilization VII.</p>
<p>During this time, there will also be a variety of free updates, which will include events and challenges, but during this, there will be bug fixes and quality-of-life achievements added to the game to make it a smoother experience for the fans of Civ.</p>
<p>That is where the roadmap ends for 2025, as it says "More to come" for October 2025 and beyond. This is likely when they start to add paid DLC to the game, the same way expansions like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/947510/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI_Gathering_Storm/?curator_clanid=25030453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gathering Storm</a> and Rise &amp; Fall were added to Civilization VI. These DLCs are typically pretty pricey and can cost the same as a game, but these DLCs typically go on sale frequently where you can get them for a much lower price.</p>
<p>Are you excited about Civilization VII?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-spider-man-2-pc-isn%E2%80%99t-off-to-a-great-start.1096947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has released Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC without too much fanfare. The system requirements were only <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a couple of days ago, way later than usual, and the launch experience leaves more than something to be desired, which was a bit surprising since the port was handled by the usually very competent Nixxes Software.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that is driving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam user reviews way down</a> (only 55% are positive at the time of writing) is the crashing. The game often crashes, as I experienced myself, with the following error message:</p>
<p><em>A problem has occurred with your display driver. This can be caused by out of date drivers, using game settings higher than your GPU can handle, an overheating GPU (current GPU temperature: 70 Celsius), or an error with the game. Please try updating your graphics drivers, or lowering your in-game settings. Current GPU and graphics driver: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 572.16 </em><br>
<em>(0x887A0006: DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG).&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-200037-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, 70° Celsius is definitely not a possible cause for GPU overheating; the drivers are the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published just yesterday by NVIDIA;</a> and there's no way the problem would be too high in-game settings with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Clearly, the issue is related to the game itself, as evidenced by the fact that many users have reported it across wildly differing PC configurations.</p>
<p>Since we mentioned graphics settings, let's take a look at what's available in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Texture Filtering (up to 16x Anisotropic)</li>
<li>Shadow Quality (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Depth of Field (up to High)</li>
<li>Level of Detail (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Traffic Density (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Crowd Density (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Hair Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Screen Space Reflections (up to High)</li>
<li>Weather particle quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced reflections (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced interiors (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced ambient occlusion (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Raytracing object range (a slider that goes up to 10)</li>
<li>DLSS Ray Reconstruction (Legacy, which means CNN, or Transformer)</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-185225.png"></a></figure>

<p>The biggest surprise is the inclusion of the latest transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which greatly improves the ray tracing quality. Menno Bil, Graphics Programmer at Nixxes, said about the feature:</p>
<p><em>In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles. We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve included two models of NVIDIA’s Ray Reconstruction, the original model introduced in DLSS 3.5 and a newly improved model designed for RTX 40 series GPUs and newer. This new model results in an overall more temporally stable image, further improving the visual quality of raytracing</em></p>
<p>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for the time being.</p>
<p>As you can read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my original review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>, the game itself is well worth waiting for the fixes, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MultiVersus To End With Season 5, Game To Go Offline]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline.1096944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumors were circulating for a little while that MultiVersus may be on death's door, as the game wasn't performing how they wanted it to. Today, it's been confirmed by the team working on MultiVersus that it will, in fact, be closing its doors on the fighting game for the "foreseeable future." The announcement was <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1885327981758865568%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a>, with the comments expressing their sadness and disappointment but also stating that they weren't surprised. While they added new characters for people to experiment with, the game wasn't well optimized, with the menus being incredibly laggy. Players felt that the team didn't support the game enough and that it was at its prime during the Beta test. Between the Beta test and the official release, a lot changed, and it wasn't for the better. While there were people regularly playing the title, the interaction with MultiVersus dropped considerably.</p>
<p>For those who want to get involved with the final season, Season 5 of MultiVersus will begin on February 4 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM GMT and will end on May 30 at the same time. Despite the game ending for the foreseeable, Season 5 will still have a 70-tier Battle Pass, as well as Aquaman and Lola Bunny being added as new playable characters to the game. However, none of the MultiVersus content that is being added in Season 5 will be paid for with real money. It is now all earned by playing the game.</p>
<p>As of today, real money transactions are no longer available. However, if you still have unused Gleamium or character tokens, you can use them to purchase in-game content until the end of Season 5. Once the season ends, the game will no longer be available online, and it won't be able to be downloaded on any storefront. However, the game will still be available to play after the online features are gone, as there will be solo vs AI options, or you can play with up to three other players in person.</p>
<p>If you want to play MultiVersus, you will need to make sure to create an account before Season 5 ends on May 30. Additionally, if you delete or uninstall the game before the end of Season 5, you will be able to reinstall after May 30.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are no announcements or updates given on what will happen to the development team, but with there now being no game to work on, it is likely there will be layoffs or a closure of the studio. Along with this, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO</a> left the company last week after the failure of both Suicide Squad and MultiVersus.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fable-could-be-a-simultaneous-xbox-ps5-switch-2-release-starfield-is-close-to-its-playstation-5-release-%E2%80%93-rumor.1096842/</guid>

			<p>Fable, the next entry in the series in development by Playground Games, may be a multiplatform release right from launch, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350777664/starfield-fable-y-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-llegaran-a-playstation-5-y-switch-2-segun-nuestras-fuentes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vandal</a>, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-big-steam-deck-new-joy-cons/">proved</a> to be somewhat reliable, shared in a new report today that work on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 versions of Fable has already begun, and the game could release on the two systems at the same time as it lands on PC and Xbox Series X and S.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing that Fable is already in the works for other systems, the new report also revealed that Killer Instinct and Starfield are among the closest former Xbox exclusives to release on other platforms. The PlayStation 5 version of Bethesda's latest RPG has been in the works since its launch in late 2023.</p>
<p>While the news of Fable being a multiplatform release right from launch must be taken with a grain of salt, there's a good chance of it happening, considering Microsoft's new strategy, and some recent statements from Phil Spencer, who said outright that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/">keeping their games off other platforms is not the path for the publisher</a>. In addition, Microsoft's new multiplatform strategy has started to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/">bear fruit</a>, so it really wouldn't be surprising for the publisher to double down on it, and release some of its most anticipated games on other platforms right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Fable is currently scheduled for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/">2025 release</a>, so it shouldn't take much longer to learn more about it, including its rumored multiplatform launch. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Like with any game that opens up pre-orders, Killing Floor 3 also shared the PC system requirements via the store pages. Long story short, it won't be a very taxing game to run on your rig.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will take place roughly 70 years after the previous installment, when megacorporation Horzine has created the ultimate army: a docile horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. The only thing standing between them and mankind is the rogue group known as Nightfall. The game puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, who'll then team up with up to five teammates. Smarter AI, dynamic environments, new and fully customizable weapons, and even more realistic dismemberment are the signature features promised by Tripwire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If having to wait two months sounds too long, you could try <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up</a> for the Closed Beta that will take place between February 20 and 24. As a side note, the game's release window s<a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hared in May 2024</a> by Embracer Group has been respected. We'll see if that's the case for two other games published by Embracer, Titan Quest II and Gothic Remake, both of which were also slated to launch by March.</p>
