			<p>Earlier this week, Moon Studios released the big Breach update for its game No Rest for the Wicked. In early access since May 2024, the action role-playing game received a lot of new content, starting with brand-new quests and new high-quality cinematic animation delivered through 18 new story scenes. The world size has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, which also include a dangerous new Blight hazard that players must beware of. There are also two new settlements, Hunter's Vale and Marin Village, and several dark caves to explore.</p>
<p>The Breach update has introduced a new endgame Plague System as well, while the Food and Hunger mechanic has been reworked and Status Effects have been overhauled. Of course, a game like this one is heavily focused on loot. No Rest for the Wicked now offers over 150 weapon options, an increase of 50 compared to launch. This includes new Gauntlet and Wand types. There are also multiple new armor sets and a rework for the Shield. Throughout the campaign, players will encounter several new boss fights (and 3 updated ones), 9 new Plague bosses, 2 new enemy factions, and 9 new critters. Those who really seek a challenge when playing the game can now activate the Hardcore mode, which enables permadeath.</p>
<p>The audio was improved with new music by Gareth Coker and new voice-overs. Moon Studios also touts extensive balance changes, quality-of-life improvements (updated item previews, tooltips), and noticeable performance improvements, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, memory usage optimizations, quicker load times, and improved physics. Lastly, the patch features 'hundreds of bug fixes'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update hasn't been well-received by No Rest for the Wicked players. Recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mostly Negative' due to a very low 36% score. Hopefully, the developers can get to the bottom of the community's feedback. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our hands-on report from May 2024</a>, the game's core does have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Austrian developer is now fully on its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having purchased the license back from publisher Private Division</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918062881930711315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an updated Overwatch 2 roadmap when it comes to the new Stadium Mode. According to the studio, this is currently the most played game mode by far, eclipsing Competitive and Quick Play modes. There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during the mode's launch week, and that's apparently more than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week (when OW Classic was added to Overwatch 2). In the mode's first week, 900 billion in Stadium cash were collectively earned, and 206 million items were chosen by players during rounds. Ironically, the most successful and yet also the least popular hero was Lucio.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest expressed by fans, Blizzard also took a step back to reveal its development history. Stadium was initially set up as an eight-team tournament that should have been as varied as possible. Each round, players would choose from random upgrades to use in PvP Team Deathmatch or PvE against the AI, losing health if they lost the round. However, it was challenging to develop a coherent strategy or build to counter opponents when decisions were made at random. Now, Blizzard still wants there to be variety from match to match, but it is no longer the top priority. The goal has shifted towards delivering a balanced and competitive mode, while at the same time allowing players to create epic builds through strategic decisions based on the performance and hero combinations of everyone in the match.</p>
<p>Stadium mode will have its builds and Hero balance tweaked in an upcoming mid-season balance patch after Blizzard has collected all the data and feedback. When it comes to new content, the latest hero (Freya) will also be the next to be available in the mode when the midseason patch goes live in Overwatch 2. That's just the beginning, as Blizzard wants to release new heroes on a regular basis to Stadium. Season 17, slated to debut next month, will introduce Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta, in addition to the new maps of Esperanca and Samoa, Custom Games, the ability to save and share builds, and crossplay. It's important to note that this is still a Competitive game mode, which means PC and console players will be in separate groups. However, the developers are looking into coming up with an Unranked mode which could bring everyone together without harming the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Season 18 will land in August, adding Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte as new Stadium heroes. Players will also find two new maps (New Route 66 and London), the new game mode Payload race, new All-Star Rewards, and the Stadium Trials feature. From Season 19 onward, Overwatch 2 will get a New China map, new heroes with every season, Draft Mode, new consumables, and item upgrades. With Payload race, Blizzard is also adding a new mechanic called Quests, where players will select a random quest that will provide rewards when completed.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with adding in-game perks. It seems like they're finally willing to shake up the game's core after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzards-steam-debut-stumbles-hard-as-overwatch-2-becomes-worst-reviewed-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly underwhelming launch</a>.</p>

			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was finally revealed after weeks of leaks, many RPG fans began to worry for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur was a brand-new RPG released just days after the Oblivion remaster, and the concern was that Oblivion would swallow up all the attention from Clair Obscur. On the outside, it looked like Xbox had screwed Clair Obscur in a big way.</p>
<p>That was not the case, as Clair Obscur surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies sold</a> days after its launch, and is one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">best-rated</a> games of 2025 so far.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a> showed that not only did Clair Obscur not get swallowed up by Oblivion, but the two seemingly helped each other. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass, so it's not a surprise that, per Ampere Analysis' data, the majority of players for both Oblivion and Clair Obscur were Xbox players.</p>
<p>What is interesting, though, is that 55% of players who played Clair Obscur on Xbox also played Oblivion. 35% of all Expedition 33 players also played Oblivion, showing huge overlap between the two. As Kelper Interactive's portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told The Game Business, "<em>I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Passâ€¦ so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.</em>"</p>
<p>Handrahan also spoke about how Clair Obscur's inclusion in the Xbox's summer showcase ahead of the game's release was a major help.</p>
<p>"<em>[During the Summer Showcase] our game was placed alongside Gears of War, Fable and products that are very traditionally known as AAA products,</em>" Handrahan said.</p>
<p>"<em>It let people understand what it was in a way that I think we would've struggled to do if we weren't allied with Xbox in that way. We couldnâ€™t have done it through a Steam demo alone, for example. It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way. Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers.</em>"</p>
<p>Xbox's support in the showcase is a clear help to Clair Obscur, but it's more interesting and hopeful to see that the shadow drop of such a massive RPG was able to help catapult the release of a new entry to the genre.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Announced Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown Surpassed 2 Million Players]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announced-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-surpassed-2-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced today that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, its 2D action platformer from the Ubisoft Montpellier team, has gone "<em>well over</em>" 2 million players since it launched at the top of 2024.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1917609908024856659">X</a>, Ubisoft announced the milestone with a short message that ended with what could be read as a hint that there's more to come regarding The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>"<em>Well over 2M players by now</em>," the post began. "<em>You've revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up.</em>"</p>
<p>That could hint that there's more to come related to The Lost Crown, but that feels unlikely because <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">Ubisoft disbanded the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that made The Lost Crown</a>. More likely, the tease is referring to the fact that there are other Prince of Persia games in the works, like the ongoing development of the early access game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was rebooted partway through development.</p>
<p>Sure, Ubisoft could try to get the Montpellier team back together. It certainly wouldn't be the first time the executive branch of a big game publisher/developer went back on a decision everyone and their mother could have told them was poor and short-sighted. If that's what's happening, then great! But it doesn't feel likely.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was undoubtedly Ubisoft's best game of 2024. Just because it didn't meet Ubisoft's sales expectations doesn't mean it wasn't a success. It had the best critical reception of any game Ubisoft released in 2024 and was one of the best games released in 2024, period.</p>
<p>Ubisoft could have taken the win of The Lost Crown being regarded as one of the best games they'd made in a long time, and focused on helping that team succeed again. Instead, they scattered that team to the wind, adding to the very public mess that Ubisoft continues to find itself in.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Ubisoft does not hold the Prince of Persia series in the same regard as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. If it did, Prince of Persia would also be part of that <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">new holding company</a>. Considering what happened with The Lost Crown, fans of the storied series have no reassurance from Ubisoft that they should actually be excited for whatever is next with the Prince of Persia series.</p>
