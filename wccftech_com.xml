			<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is Nintendo's next film up to bat, with a release date set for April 3, 2026, though it already has another film set up for 2027. The Legend of Zelda movie is due to release on May 7, 2027, and today on the Nintendo Today! app, Nintendo announced that the project had begun filming. It also revealed our first look at the film's two leads in character.</p>



<p>About a month after Nintendo announced that the Legend of Zelda movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">would release in May 2027</a>, the company announced that 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth would be stepping into the role of Link, and 21-year-old Bo Bragason would be playing Princess Zelda. Today, along with the announcement that filming has begun, we got our first look at Bragason and Ainsworth in their iconic roles.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the actors are in these shots, while the final film will have you believing they're in Hyrule, <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">they're actually in New Zealand</a>. A production listing indicates that filming will take place from November 4, 2025, to April 7, 2026, so it's likely that the whole film will be shot there.</p>



<p>As Nintendo delves deeper into adapting its properties into films and potentially even TV shows, out of the projects we know of now, this upcoming Legend of Zelda movie is arguably the most intriguing one. After the first Super Mario Bros. Movie, we have a pretty clear idea of where these films will sit: well-animated stories that bring a huge spotlight to Nintendo and its flagship franchise, suited for all ages.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda Movie could be the live-action version of that, but it could also lean into the darker, more mature elements of storytelling within the Zelda universe and try to be something with a more dramatic bent. We'll see where it lands on May 7, 2027.</p>

			<p>Concord remains, for now, arguably the greatest commercial failure for Sony and PlayStation in the history of the PlayStation platform. <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">After just ten days on the market</a> between the end of August and the beginning of September 2024, Sony pulled it from store shelves and confirmed servers would go offline, rendering the online-only game unplayable for the few players who bought it. Fast forward to the last few days, and Concord was playable to those with a legal copy of the game courtesy of fan-made custom servers, until Sony killed it once again.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, it began with Sony issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos that were uploaded by the creators behind the project of them playing Concord on the custom servers they built. The takedowns were issued by a company listed as MarkScan, which is generally the face Sony uses to issue claims like this.</p>



<p>Though Sony wasn't directly targeting the project of building custom servers for Concord, just videos of gameplay on these custom servers, shortly after the takedowns came through, one of the lead developers behind the project stated in the Concord Delta Discord, "<em>Due to worrying legal action we've decided</em> <em>to pause invites for the time being</em>."</p>



<p>As previously stated, Sony hasn't attacked the actual project of building the custom servers. It's also worth noting that the developers were being extremely careful to remove and disallow any players from trying to share illegal copies of the game, and would only allow players who had legally obtained a copy of Concord. </p>



<p>"<em>I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do,</em>" the team wrote. "<em>We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files</em>."</p>



<p>So while Sony hasn't directly issued a takedown to the project itself, the indirect action of taking down the videos seems to have been enough for Sony to show the development team that it knows about what they are doing, and it will take every path it can to strike it down. </p>
