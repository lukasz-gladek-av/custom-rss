			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for Splatoon 3 cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been added to even more PC games, providing accelerated frame rates to owners of RTX graphics cards, depending on their GPU. Users equipped with the RTX 20 or 30 Series can enable DLSS Super Resolution, those with an RTX 40 Series graphics card can add DLSS Frame Generation, and the lucky few who have purchased a shiny new RTX 50 GPU can boost frame rates even further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>One of those games is Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The game already supported DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and several ray traced effects when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on PC earlier this year. Now, an update has added Multi Frame Generation, allowing RTX 50 Series users an average boost of 4.9x at 4K resolution with all settings maxed out, ray tracing included. The GeForce RTX 5090 runs the game at 256.5 FPS, the RTX 5080 reaches 209.5 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti averages 184.9 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Similarly, the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> three months ago in early access with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With a new update, the game now supports Multi Frame Generation, and the NVIDIA app allows RTX users to activate the override to the improved NVIDIA DLSS 4 transformer AI model for better visual quality.</p>
<p>Today is release day for two highly anticipated PC games. One of them is Funcom's Dune: Awakening, which debuted last week for those who had purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate editions, but kicks off for everyone today. The massive survival sandbox multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-boosts-performance-by-an-average-of-4-9x-in-dune-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex, as well as the aforementioned transformer AI model override via the NVIDIA app. Just like in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the average performance uplift is 4.9x. The GeForce RTX 5090 averages 338 frames per second, and even the GeForce RTX 5070 is practically at 200 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other game due to launch today is Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-pc-system-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>, which also includes all the above plus NVIDIA DLAA. Looking ahead, June 12 will mark the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade on PC.</a> Shift Up's acclaimed action game also supports all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies, providing an average 3.4x performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, goes up to 540 frames per second, while both the RTX 5080 and the RTX 5070 Ti surpass 300 frames per second, and the RTX 5070 reaches 260 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Next week, Sloclap is going to release the arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REMATCH</a>. This isn't a particularly taxing game, but you'll still be able to turn on NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex to maximize your experience when the game launches on June 19.</p>

<p>On July 1, the multiplayer action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a> will make its debut with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. Lastly, The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be releasing on September 4) will still feature the full RTX suite (DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing) just like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base game</a>. Unfortunately, NVIDIA did not mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair update</a> that was supposed to be released a while ago but never materialized.</p>
