			<p>Epic Games has <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1866894827930976259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ballistic-is-a-5v5-tactical-first-person-competitive-mode-launching-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is now available on early access as planned. This is a 5-versus-5 tactical competitive mode made exclusively for first-person view. Here, players are always split into attackers and defenders, and each team is tasked with an opposing goal: to either plant a Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map or prevent this from happening, respectively.</p>
<p>All matches in Fortnite Ballistic begin with players on each team selecting one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use. Each Flex Gadget is very powerful, according to Epic, enough to potentially turn the tide of a match if used correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Proximity Mine can be placed on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy. They can be picked up and placed again and will explode if shot.</li>
<li>The Bubble Shield allows you to drop a temporary protective bubble that shields you and your team from bullets and grenades alike.</li>
<li>The Recon Grenade gadget will mark any enemies near where it's thrown, even through walls. Throw a Recon Gadget into a location before entering to get an idea of who might be waiting for you.</li>
<li>The regular but always trustworthy Frag Grenade couldn't be missing, of course. It will bounce and explode as you'd expect, dealing damage to nearby enemies. In Fortnite Ballistic, you'll take damage from your own grenades, but the same does not apply to allies.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the Impulse Grenade gadget is a disruptive tool that scatters enemies and allies. It has many creative uses, such as launching teammates into a location from a distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, Epic Games also announced that Fortnite creators can publish Islands using the First Person Camera Mode device, allowing even more dedicated first-person experiences to be created and shared throughout the game. It certainly looks like Epic is pushing hard to improve first-person content in their title.</p>
