			<p>A new trailer has been released by Bossa Games and Humble Games for Lost Skies, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-skies-is-an-open-world-co-op-game-based-on-worlds-adrift/">open-world cooperative PvE survival game</a> that takes place among floating islands. This game will be available during February's Steam Next Fest, where players will get to take part in a multiplayer demo. The demo is expansive, offering players the opportunity to play five to six hours of the game. Lost Skies is home to ancient ruins that can be explored, a fully customizable skyship, and intricate puzzles that need to be solved. If this sounds like something you're interested in, you can choose to play the game on your own and go solo, or you can team up with up to six friends. Check out the gameplay trailer below to see what you can expect from Lost Skies.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies: Cinematic Trailer | Bossa Studios ☁️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVgbYFWSOZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of building a base on a planet or island, you have your very own Skyship that you can customize and evolve over time. You get to take your base around the world with you as you explore, helping you explore safely and gather any resources you may need. It will also help keep you safe against the elements and threats in the skies.</p>
<p>Compared to other survival games, Lost Skies is considered a "Survival Lite," allowing you to get to grips with the survival elements of the game without feeling like you're punished for not doing things in a certain order or grinding materials off the bat.</p>
<p>There will be tons to explore, from ruins, ancient civilizations, and colossal creatures that you will have to take down. There will be plenty of variety across the many floating islands in the sky, where you can use a grappling hook to interact with the world around you, also providing you with a way to traverse and soar through the sky.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist the title on Steam now</a> or try out the free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Island Creator</a>, where you can design your very own floating island that can be played. You can create your own island full of puzzles, traps, and stories. It's entirely up to you how you decorate and create your island, and it can then be released to other players via the Steam Workshop.</p>
