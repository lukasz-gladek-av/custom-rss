			<p>Right at the end of 2025, as <strong>Amazon's</strong> second season of its successful <strong>Fallout TV show </strong>adaptation was airing, a report appeared to identify the next TV show adaptation Amazon would be pulling out of the Fallout franchise: <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show/">a reality TV show competition based on <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong></a>. Well, that report has been proven true, as Amazon confirmed today that it is developing a reality TV competition show based on Fallout Shelter, where contestants will test their nuclear apocalypse survival skills for a cash prize.</p>



<p>The news was revealed in a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a>, which confirmed that the series will begin with <strong>10 episodes</strong> and that <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting for the series has officially opened</a>. According to the show's logline, this new reality TV competition show is "<em>Set inside Vault-Tec’s bomb-proof vaults, ‘Fallout Shelter’ drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games’ signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling. Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork, and resilience as they compete for safety, power, and ultimately a huge cash prize</em>."</p>

In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society.

<p>The casting page for the show adds that contestants will be tested on challenges all to do with seven core attributes players can upgrade in the games: Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). </p>



<p>"<em>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances</em>," the casting page reads. "<em>It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?</em>"</p>



<p>The report adds that the show will feature "<em>deeply social, psychological, and narrative-driven gameplay</em>," to match the "<em>choice-driven ethos</em>" of the games. Bethesda's <strong>James Altman</strong> and <strong>Todd Howard</strong> are both signed on as executive producers on the show, alongside Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, Jack Burgess, Toni Ireland, Stephen Yemoh, Stephen Lovelock and Amina Badresingh from Studio Lambert.</p>

If you're looking for something Fallout-related to keep you in the Fallout mindset for the show, then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">beyond checking out the second season </a>of the original TV show adaptation and diving back into<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/"> Fallout 4 with the Anniversary Edition</a>, you can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">rumoured remasters of <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong></a>. </p>

			<p>2024's <strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> was one of the best games to release that year, despite it being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/">VR Meta Quest 3 exclusive and not arriving until December</a>. A sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">accidentally confirmed by one of its voice actors, <strong>Mark Rolston</strong></a>, who was set to play Commissioner Gordon in the coming sequel. But a new report from <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-canceled-as-camouflaj-sees-significant-layoffs/">UploadVR</a> reveals that <strong>Meta's</strong> recent 10% layoff to its Reality Labs division hit developer <strong>Camouflaj</strong> with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs, cancelling the sequel, and <strong>marking the end of Camouflaj developing VR games entirely</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong>Sanzaru Games</strong> were both shuttered by Meta</a> as part of the recent layoffs, which saw <strong>1,000</strong> people get laid off across the Reality Labs branch of Meta. While Camouflaj was one of the few that didn't get entirely shut down, according to the report, the studio "<em>has seen significant layoffs, and will no longer be developing VR games</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that Sanzaru Games was working on the Arkham Shadow sequel alongside Camouflaj, though that work ended once Sanzaru was shuttered, which also contributed to the sequel project getting cancelled. </p>



<p>With the teams behind two of the best VR games to release in recent years either shut down or pushed out of making VR games entirely, it's a clear sign from Meta that it is no longer invested in making VR games. It's also a sign of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones">Meta stepping away from its Metaverse focus</a> and instead investing in AI.</p>



<p>VR hasn't grown to be the next frontier of gaming in the way that many touted it would for years, as it remains a niche part of tech and the gaming industry, but it's still upsetting to see the teams that were making genuine strides in pushing the medium forward have been pushed out of it. Sanzaru Games' Asgard's Wrath 2 was regarded as one of the best VR games ever made when it arrived in 2023. Arkham Shadow was a new step forward for what combat could look like in VR.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this isn't the end for Camouflaj entirely, and we still see them move on to make their own games, rather than becoming a support studio for the few remaining teams under Meta's Reality Labs division still making VR games.</p>
