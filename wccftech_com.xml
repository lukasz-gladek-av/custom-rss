			<p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming a key component across many industries, and video game development is certainly not absent from this trend. While several publishers are accelerating the push to integrate AI tools into their studios, the inconsistent results and the associated concerns over job displacement for human artists and developers continue to make this push highly controversial.</p>



<p>However, with the right approach, AI can deliver some frankly impressive results in video games, as highlighted in a new video showcasing an AI remake of the beloved The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>This AI remake was created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aillusory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aillusory</a></strong>, who titled their project <em>“The Witcher 3 but it's AI slop - Reimagined by AI.”</em> Despite the creator’s self-deprecating label, this fan project utilized AI to generate photorealistic visuals from footage captured from the original game, overhauling nearly every visual element—from environments to characters. </p>



<p>The results are not perfect, but it's undeniable that this AI remake looks impressive more often than not. It largely retains the original game's recognizable art style for both environments and characters while enhancing them in a fairly credible, photorealistic fashion.</p>



<p>The end results are so impressive that users are consistently praising them. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"AI will first become the best reshade filter, before it's used to make games,"</em> said YouTube commenter misapheonix, a sentiment that is easy to share, considering the quality of this AI-powered remake.</p>

<p>Regardless of potential AI enhancements, an official, CD Projekt RED-developed remake of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is likely years away. The original game has aged quite well, and its visuals continue to improve thanks to the dedication of the modding community. Known modder Halk Hogan announced last month that a new version of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-2026-announced-with-new-trailer/"><strong>HD Reworked Project is scheduled to launch in 2026.</strong></a></p>



<p>Despite the lack of an immediate official overhaul, we will see more of Geralt of Rivia in the future. Besides hopefully appearing in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher IV</strong></a>, the White Wolf will return in the complete remake of the first entry in the series. Developed by Fool's Theory, this remake promises to breathe new life into one of the most iconic RPGs released in the early 2000s, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complete with improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">a host of other enhancements.</strong></a> The official release window for this remake remains unknown.</p>
