			<p>The next version of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler will come with some significant improvements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who previously provided correct information regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PSSR upscaler before the official announcement, revealed that Sony is training a new lightweight neural network requiring less frame time to upscale that will offer higher image quality, no matter the base resolution a game is upscaled from. Currently, PSSR requires a base resolution of 864p, which is pretty high compared to the Ultra Performance NVIDIA DLSS option, for example, but the next iteration of the upscaler should be able to deliver better image quality upscaling from lower base resolutions.</p>
<p>According to the leaker, one of the main reasons Sony is working on this new version of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler, which may not even be marketed as PSSR 2, because they want to get better at running 4K resolution at 120 FPS and offer 8K resolution output at 60 frames per second. While some games already offer 4K resolution at 120 FPS with the current version of PSSR, the new version of the upscaler will make it so that games that currently can't push past the 70, 80 FPS range can offer better performance besides the improved image quality, which will see improvements in line with the leap in quality from AMD FSR 2.0 to 3.1. Additionally, the new version of the upscaler will offer wider resolution offerings, supporting 1440p and 1080p resolutions at locked 120 FPS, which the current version of the upscaler doesn't, as it only used to offer 4K resolution output. Better image quality is reportedly also coming to PlayStation 5 Pro games that don't use PSSR to upscale with MFSR, which was the internal acronym for the upscaler. MFSR will be an alternative option to TAA to offer better image quality.</p>

<p>With the current implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-playstation-5-pro-disappoints/">hit-and-miss</a> so far, it's not surprising that Sony is working on a new iteration that will likely benefit the future console generation, considering the PlayStation 6 will likely support PSSR as well. Hopefully, it won't take long to see this new version of the upscaler in action and to know whether it will deliver all of these rumored promises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox took over the main stage at PAX East 2025 today to focus on two of its games, Borderlands 4 and Risk of Rain 2. For the latter, a brand new expansion was announced, titled Alloyed Collective. For the former, members of the development team, including Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, took to the stage and answered a few questions from the community, but notably, Pitchford was unable to answer one pretty important question, one that he says Gearbox doesn't have an answer for yet.</p>
<p>Starting with Risk of Rain 2, the new expansion goes deeper into Petrichor V, with six new stages for players to dig into, and if you're playing with friends, only one of you needs to own the Alloyed Collective expansion for all of you to enjoy the new content.</p>
<p>The Alloyed Collective will add 15 new items for players to grab, seven new enemies to fight, and two new survivors to master. There's currently no release date, with the announcement trailer below simply stating that it is "<em>coming&nbsp;</em><em>soon.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Risk of Rain 2 | Alloyed Collective Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXaaA5yCXW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as new details about Borderlands 4, Pitchford was joined by Andrew Reiner, chief creative officer at Gearbox, April Johnson, associate narrative director at Gearbox, Nick Thurston, lead game designer, and Grant Kao, associate creative director.</p>
<p>After recapping the end of Borderlands 3, the Gearbox panel dug into community questions, starting with what's up with the rest of the Crimson Raiders, and according to Johnson, the answer is that they've all split up looking for Lilith across the galaxy. Johnson also confirmed that we'll be seeing more of them in Borderlands 4, but didn't dig much further into detail.</p>
<p>Johnson also talked about the antagonist in Borderlands 4, the Timekeeper, the events that kick off the story of Borderlands 4, and the chaos that the vault hunters find when they arrive on Kairos at the start of the game. The broad strokes of these narrative details were all things we learned during Gearbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-state-of-play-deep-dives-into-gameplay-gear-movement-changes-and-more/">State of Play event for Borderlands 4 last week</a>, so with the added time afforded Johnson and the rest of the team at the panel, they went through the individual backstories of the four new vault hunters, Rafa, Vex, Harlowe, and Amon, the planet of Kairos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gearbox Main Theater Show at PAX East 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pitchford added that there are no load times when players are exploring Kairos, and said it is the "<em>biggest</em>" world that the team has made for players to explore in the entire Borderlands series.</p>
<p>Beyond revealing too many narrative details and spoiling too much of the game, the one notable question Pitchford didn't exactly answer was the question of how much Borderlands 4 will cost. Instead of being able to give a direct answer, Pitchford went into a long response as to what Gearbox and his own thinking is on the issue.</p>
<p>"<em>I'll tell you the truth, I don't know. And that is the truth,</em>" he began saying."<em>It's an interesting time, right? On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where the people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people that are price sensitive. So there's some folks that don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>There's other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is I don't know what the price is going to be. I do know that we will be opening pre-orders soon, and that will be when the price is</em> <em>set</em>."<em><br>
</em></p>
<p>"...<em>We're going to have a price set soon. </em><em>It might be the new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with. It might be that we stay back. It’s going to be the people at the [Gearbox] publishing house that decide that...We’ll know soon. I think it’s going to be fine, whatever it ends up being. Borderlands 4 is [expletive] amazing. It’s worth it.</em>"</p>
<p>The question of pricing has been a big one for games since discussions around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> being priced at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNjv6cqZeNAxXapIkEHUobAoEQFnoECDwQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3L37WylpHEkWHXgJBm8zXw">$100</a> started to make the rounds. Now that Nintendo has broken the seal with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">$80 Mario Kart</a>, it's almost certain that GTA VI will cost at least $80. But it wouldn't be shocking to see Take-Two test the waters of an $80 game with Gearbox and Borderlands 4 hitting that same bar.</p>
<p>Earlier in the Q&amp;A session, Pitchford mentioned an event Gearbox will be hosting in June, so it could be that pre-orders will go live at the time of that event, which could very well be around the time of Summer Game Fest. If so, we won't have to wait very long at all to see where Gearbox ends up landing.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/">Overwatch 2</a> team at Blizzard has just unionized, making it the second wall-to-wall union under Blizzard after the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft team unionized in July 2024</a>.</p>
<p>It's the latest major step forward for unionization in the video game industry, as almost 200 developers at Activision Blizzard are members of the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA. They now join the ranks of <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers">ZeniMax Workers United</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the aforementioned WoWGG-CWA.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Nearly 200 game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall</span></em> <em>union</em>," a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">press release</a> from the CWA reads.</p>
<p>"<em>A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal. The workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, Calif., and Microsoft has recognized the union.</em>"</p>
<p>While some of the above unions are department-specific, the WoWGG-CWA and the newly formed Overwatch 2 union spread across all departments, from artists to QA to game designers, level designers, etc. The OWGG-CWA will now join its fellow unions in negotiating their first contract, a process that the CWA previously accused <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/microsofts-bargaining-delays-leave-video-game-workers-without-union-contracts-two">Microsoft of dragging its feet on</a>.</p>
<p>Bargaining delays were one of the reasons the ZeniMax Workers United union members cited for overwhelmingly voting in favor of giving strike powers to their bargaining representatives. At the beginning of last month, the vote was announced, with 94% of members voting 'yes' to strike authorization. They have yet to announce if a strike will be called as negotiations continue.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">Kotaku</a>, Blizzard test analyst Simon Hedrick cited the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">mass layoffs</a> that started 2024 as to what drove him to seriously consider unionizing, and that "<em>u</em><em>p to that moment I’d been really happy in what I was doing.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it</em>," Hendrick said. "<em>What I want to protect most here is the people</em>."</p>
<p>Unions can't prevent layoffs, but they can give those affected by them the best-case version of a worst-case scenario, and they can also improve the lives of workers in a number of other ways. Hopefully, the new Overwatch union and the other groups under Microsoft will be able to reach a deal sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm organizing because I believe in this company, our teams, and the work we do together. Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions,</em>" said senior test analyst and organizing committee member Jess Castillo in the previously mentioned press release. "<em>Ultimately, when we're supported and thriving, we can deliver the best possible experiences to our players, which is what brought all of us here in the first place.</em>"</p>
