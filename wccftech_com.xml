			<p>2024 has seen some great horror games. From eldritch horrors to a girl with superpowers, to surviving horrific trials and, of course, the release of the highly-anticipated Silent Hill 2 remake. If you've been wanting some new scares but aren't sure what games are hot off the press and perfect to play, this list sums up the best horror games that came out this year. We've been spoiled for choice with the games that have been released, especially with titles like Still Wakes the Deep and Silent Hill 2.</p>
<p>For more of our lists of the best games released this year, make sure to check the website regularly, as more lists are released by our team in the final days of the year.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a></em></p>

<h2>Silent Hill 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that we're listing Silent Hill 2 first. While it performs better on PlayStation 5 than it does on PC, the game is still a great experience and has helped introduce new people to the franchise, as well as provide nostalgia to those who were already deep in the Silent Hill fandom. With the history of Bloober Team, a lot of fans were very nervous about how this game would pan out. However, it turned out to be a faithful remake, with some extra easter eggs from the original that made fans happy with the product they received. Overall, it was an incredibly well-done job, and we can only hope that they will remake the others in the future.</p>

<h2>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's a surprising title to make it onto the list, but this exclusive Nintendo Switch title has been one of the best horror game releases of 2024. The Famicom Detective Club series was first started in 1988, with the original titles getting a remake for the Nintendo Switch in 2021. Fast forward to now, and we have Emio - The Smiling Man. This game felt like it came out of nowhere, but it was also an exciting title for those who managed to play the originals or for those who enjoyed horror in the form of a visual novel. While it may not be everyone's typical horror cup of tea, it's definitely worth a shot if you want to feel on edge and creeped out by the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>The Casting of Frank Stone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone was a highly anticipated game by fans of Dead by Daylight and was titled Supermassive Games, as this would be the first collaboration between Behavior and Supermassive. The collaboration resulted in a choice-matter horror game based on the world of Dead by Daylight, but those unfamiliar wouldn't need any prior knowledge of the game. Below is an excerpt from Francesco De Meo's review of The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p><em>The story of The Casting of Frank Stone is definitely among the game's best features, if not the very best. Supermassive Games managed to create a story that, while rooted in the lore of Dead by Daylight's universe, is thoroughly enjoyable even by those, like myself, who aren't too familiar with it.&nbsp; The multiple timelines also work quite well, and it is extremely interesting to see how characters have changed over the years.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Crow Country</h2>
<p><a href="https://crowcountrygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> came as quite a surprising hit, as the game set out to be a love letter to original survival horror games from the 90s. It had the same aesthetic as the original Resident Evil and Silent Hill games and somehow managed to provide that familiar feeling of nostalgia while keeping you on edge and fighting for your survival in a horrifying theme park full of monsters. This game also made it onto our l<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/">ist of games to play for Halloween this year</a>, where you can find more horror games to check out if you're in need of a scare.</p>
<p>Crow Country was released in May and has been a highly successful horror indie game since then. On Metacritic, it has a score of 84 and a User Score of 7.9.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alone in the Dark (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Alone in the Dark features a star-studded cast, with David Harbour (Stranger Things, State of Affairs) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Doctor Foster) as the main characters. This title is a re-imagining of the original 1992 Alone in the Dark and is also the seventh installment in the franchise. If you're a fan of eldritch horrors, this game is something that you're going to enjoy, as they uncover hideous monsters, horrifying environments, and a lot more terrifying things that will keep you on edge. Admittedly, this game wasn't as popular with critics and the general audience, receiving a score of 63 on Metacritic and a user score of 7.4. Unfortunately, the studio (Pieces Interactive) was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> shortly after the game's launch due to its commercial performance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deemed unsatisfactory by parent company Embracer</a>.</p>

			<p>One of the new features introduced in Unreal Engine 5.5, MegaLights, promises to be a game changer in terms of both performance and image quality over Lumen, as highlighted by a new tech demo now available online.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube this week by MxBenchmarkPC, which can be watched below, compares <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/836ed2f8-e2d6-49be-98d3-59d104bd351e">Quixel's Unreal Engine 5.5 Dark Ruins tech demo</a> running with software Lumen, hardware Lumen only, and hardware Lumen with MegaLights, highlighting how the new tech introduced in the latest version of the game engine by Epic not only brings a considerable performance improvement of up to 50% but also improves image quality at 4K, 1440p and 1080p resolutions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.5 MegaLights Demo - Massive Up to 50% Performance Boost and Better Image Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXnhKix16UQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/">MegaLights</a>, an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights, which enables developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights without constraints, isn't the only thing that Unreal Engine 5.5 brings. The latest version of the engine brings significant improvements to Sequencer, the engine's nonlinear animation editor, MetaHuman Animator, which now allows developers to generate high-quality facial animations just from audio performances, a Mutable character customization system that can be used to generate dynamic skeletal meshes, materials, and textures for characters, animals, props, weapons, and more with optimized memory usage that keeps shader cost low and more. More information on all the new features and improvements featured in the new version of the engine can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-on-january-8th-alleged-first-image-of-the-dock-surfaces-online.1069311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could finally be revealed in less than two weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hl5l1u/chinese_weibo_leaker_who_leaked_the_whole_june/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hlp8zn/the_chinese_weibo_user_has_deleted_all_previous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> subreddits, Chinese Weibo leaker 荷姆荷姆嗼, who previously correctly revealed all the June Nintendo Direct announcements before the presentation aired, recently started a countdown based on the Fibonacci sequence numbers that will end on January 8th, which could be when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed. Since having been discovered, the user deleted all of their posts, changed their profile pic, and said that the countdown was for something else, but this could be an attempt to cover things up and avoid getting identified.</p>
<p>The past few days have also heated up in terms of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks with the first alleged images of the system and the dock shared by a user going by the name of <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a>, who garnered increased attention following<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/"> a report</a> from The Verge, which believed the supposed leaker had indeed access to the yet to be revealed new system from Nintendo. After sharing an image of the<a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> system itself</a>, which doesn't look exactly legit, the leaker shared a <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1872092668551176251?t=BgCKgr3jtPRxnDOHi8Zfog&amp;s=19">second image</a> showcasing the dock, which definitely looks more believable. Still, given how wild the alleged leaks are getting, we must take everything with a huge grain of salt until Nintendo finally lifts the lid on its next-gen system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but the moment we finally see the system may not be<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/"> too far off</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Control Is Once Again Free to Grab on the Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store.1069308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games&nbsp;<span>Store's Christmas 2024 gift is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>. At the time this post goes live, you have another six hours or so </span>to permanently add it to your library for free.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not the first time the game&nbsp;<span>has been offered through such a promotion. The Epic Games Store itself already&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it away for free</a> in June 2021; the following year, AT&amp;T subscribers could <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ultimate-edition-available-for-free-through-atts-streaming-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redeem the Ultimate Edition for free</a></span>. In that light, it might be a tad underwhelming. However, for anybody who still hasn't got the chance to play the game, it's absolutely worth taking up on the freebie.</p>
<p>Released in August 2019, Control was Remedy's return to owned IPs after making Quantum Break for Microsoft. It was developed on a €30 million budget, which is relatively small for a triple-A game, and published by 505 Games. The game was highly successful for Remedy (over 4.5 million units sold), not to mention an excellent action/adventure to play, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review of the game</a> where I scored it 8 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Control features Remedy's most original setting yet, the studio's most open-ended game environment yet and great action combat that makes you feel like a badass. The game also stands out on PC as one of the finest examples of real-time ray tracing to date. It shouldn't be passed upon by any action/adventure game fans, even if it's not quite a masterpiece.</em></p>
<p>Control is part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which includes Alan Wake. As such, protagonist Jesse Faden has appeared in the Alan Wake 2 DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a>. She is, of course, due to reprise her role again in the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">action RPG sequel</a>, which will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-financed by Annapurna Interactive</a>. The media production company is also going to adapt the universe to the film and TV series formats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IP will be expanded next year with the release of the cooperative multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, where players take the role of Federal Bureau of Control first responders who get sent to defend the FBC's HQ, the eerie, ever-shifting Oldest House, from any kind of paranatural threats.</p>
