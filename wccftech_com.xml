			<p>Much of the Slitterhead gameplay revolves around Rarities, gifted humans who can achieve higher attunement with the mysterious Night Owl and maintain their consciousness while being possessed, which allows them to use some unique fighting styles and skills that can make your life easier against all sorts of opponents.</p>
<p>Unlock new Rarities is also a necessity to proceed in the main campaign, as you will need the help of specific characters to continue Night Owl's war against Slitterheads. The first time this happens is right after starting to investigate a religious cult that seems to be bringing together monsters and humans, and you will need Edo's help to proceed in this investigation.</p>

<p>Once you are notified of needing a new Rarity to proceed through the story, play the Parasite Mission 2nd round mission again. At the start of the mission, proceed normally until you reach the main street. Walk around until you hear two NPCs talking about a stray dog and a homeless man. Continue past these two characters, and you will find the stray dog, who is the same one you have met at the very start of the game. Possess it, follow the scent like you did at the beginning of the game, and you will eventually reach the homeless man named Edo. Possess the character, defeat the Slitterhead, and he will join Night Owl in his quest. Quit the mission, and the Hidden Cave RE 2nd Loop mission will be unlocked.</p>
<p>Besides being required to proceed through the story, Edo is an extremely strong Rarity to use if you enjoy fighting Slitterheads head-on, as he is a close-range fighter that can dish quite a bit of damage, deflect attacks automatically, perform a quick dodging maneuver, and increase attack power with his skills. He may not be a looker, but he sure knows how to deal with enemies!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-%E2%80%93-how-to-easily-defeat-special-forces-unit-members.1027596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-defeat-special-forces-unit-members-easily/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031121432_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031122458_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>

			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios announced that the first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream will air tomorrow at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET <a href="http://twitch.tv/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> from Kuttenberg, one of the two main cities featured in the game. During the stream, the developers will hold a special live Q&amp;A session, during which they will reveal more information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio has announced a four-part live-action video series starring Tom McKay and Luke Dale, who play Henry of Skalitz (the main character) and his noble friend Hans Capon. The debut episode set in Kutná Hora will go live on Thursday, November 7, at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET on the developer's <a href="http://youtube.com/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now set to launch on February 11, 2025. When the game was first unveiled earlier this year, the goal was to release it before the end of 2024. However, a short delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. That's where we had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima, who was all too happy to dive into the game's features for our readers.</p>
<p>By the way, Warhorse also announced today a major milestone for the first installment. It was only this February that Kingdom Come Deliverance <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-passes-6-million-sales-on-its-6th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> six million units sold on its sixth anniversary; nine months later, it has surpassed 8 million units. It's likely due to major discounts ahead of the sequel, but it's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the developers published a blog post <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/4514388158400430393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> where Senior Game Designer Ondřej Bittner talked about the inner workings of survival in the game.</p>
<p><em>The game has survival elements to it because you have to eat and you have to sleep. But that’s for the immersion. It's not hard to be rested and well fed and so on. The food spoils over time, so if you’re going somewhere far away it’s good to have dried fruit or dried meat jerky because it lasts longer. You can be vulnerable when you’re asleep. You can be robbed, or you can be attacked, depending on the circumstances. We even have it in the executioner’s historical records that someone might rob a house, get drunk, and then pass out on the bed - the perfect crime…</em></p>
<p><em>But generally, if you’re found somewhere you’re not supposed to be, you’ll be woken up. Or if someone’s looking for you because you did something wrong and they find you asleep, they’ll wake you up. You’ll need to pay your fine, or you’ll be arrested, whipped, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Overall, the design philosophy is said to differ from the average game. Rather than asking players to focus on tasks, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will encourage players to pay attention to their surroundings.</p>
