			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">Embark Studios</a></strong> has just revealed the next update and <strong>map condition</strong> coming to <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, with <strong>hurricanes</strong> arriving next week on <strong>February 24, 2026,</strong> in the game's new <strong>Shrouded Sky </strong>update.</p>



<p>The short teaser doesn't show any gameplay, but it does make it clear how disruptive and dangerous the hurricanes will be for raiders who choose to brave the weather while the condition is in effect. A <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">blog post</a> on the ARC Raiders' official website digs further into what raiders will have to deal with, and it's a little more than some high-speed winds.</p>



<p>"<em>The climate is damaged and unpredictable, causing violent weather events across the surface,</em>" the post reads. "<em>You've already experienced some of them, but southern Italy is about to kick up another challenge to Raiders who dare to brave the surface</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Trying to run against the winds, as you might imagine, will slow you down and quickly drain your stamina. You'll also have to be aware of the wind when trying to toss grenades or other throwables, since they can be swept away into the wind if you don't properly plan your throw. You also won't be able to rely on gas grenades and smoke grenades in the same way, as a turn of the wind will impact them as well.</p>



<p>You'll also have to be aware of flying debris, whether that's flying bits of dirt or something much larger that could do some huge damage if you're not careful. Whatever it is, though, your shield will take damage from flying debris and make you more visible to other raiders. That said, if you choose to risk going Topside without a shield, that'll provide another layer of camouflage, since you won't be spotted by the constant flash of your shield. </p>



<p>Speaking of visibility, that's also going to be far more limited during the hurricanes, meaning you'll have to be even more vigilant to make sure you're not caught off guard by other raiders or ARC. With all of this downside and struggles involved in heading Topside while hurricanes are raging the surface, you're probably wondering why it's worth the risk.</p>



<p>That upside comes in the form of valuable Raider caches that aren't just your average caches, but caches from the <strong>First Wave</strong>, which ARC Raiders lore-heads will recognize as caches from a bygone era, surely to be filled with valuable loot. We'll see what that loot looks like when the new map condition arrives this coming <strong>Tuesday, February 24, 2026.</strong></p>

			<p>We've been surprised by video game studio closures before, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"><strong>Xbox </strong>shut down <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> and <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>,</a> but this latest studio closure is arguably the most shocking one we've seen in a long time. <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, the studio responsible for the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> and decades of remakes and remasters across several iconic franchises, is being <strong>shut down by</strong> <strong>PlayStation</strong>.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> who broke the news that just <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-acquire-bluepoint-games/">five years after</a></strong> the studio officially joined the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> family, its remaining <strong>70 developers</strong> are losing their jobs in what is yet another baffling decision by PlayStation leadership.</p>



<p>"<em>Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,</em>" a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement, per Bloomberg's report. "<em>We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftsmanship</em>."</p>







<p>After the Demon's Souls Remake was one of the day-one launch titles for the release of the <strong>PS5</strong>, and the studio was officially brought under the PlayStation Studios banner, there was never an official confirmation as to what the studio was working on next. We knew it had done some co-development work on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, and beyond that, there were plenty of rumours and hopes. Bluepoint was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">popular choice for players to do a <strong>Bloodborne Remaster</strong></a> if that project were to ever actually happen.</p>



<p>The most reliable answer we have as to what the studio has been working on also came from a previous Bloomberg report, which was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live-service</strong> game that was cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. According to today's report from Bloomberg, following that project's cancellation, Bluepoint did its best to pitch future projects to <strong>Herman Hulst</strong> and the rest of PlayStation's top brass, none of which were accepted, it would seem.</p>



<p>As if this couldn't be any more tragic than it already was, the studio was celebrating its <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year, after being founded all the way back in <strong>2006</strong>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Eternal Darkness</strong> and <strong>Legacy of Kain</strong> creator <strong>Denis Dyack</strong> shared a lot of interesting thoughts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYlGJiZeT5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a two-hour-long interview with KiwiTalkz</a>, in which he addressed <strong>the lack of optimization of many Unreal Engine 5 games</strong>. You might remember that his upcoming game, <strong>Deadhaus Sonata</strong>, was powered by the <strong>Amazon Lumberyard</strong> engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadhaus-sonata-qa-denis-dyacks-quest-to-bring-narrative-to-the-online-space-through-genvids-interactive-streaming-and-the-power-of-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we last talked to him a few years ago</a>. Well, Dyack's studio went through several engine changes before eventually landing on Epic's technology after <strong>patching things up with the company following their previous dispute over Too Human</strong>.</p>



<p>Now a user of the leading game-making tool, Dyack <strong>pointed the finger at the current state of the industry</strong>, largely absolving the engine itself and adding that <strong>most game companies do not really even have time to optimize games anymore</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Most people who use Unreal Engine 5 have very large teams and those very large teams have a lot of people who know one specific part of what they do. <strong>There is an artist that all they do are blades of grass. They optimize for the blades of grass, but they have no idea what's happening in the other systems.</strong> And when you have two, 300, maybe a thousand people working on these systems, they're all going in their own directions and they're all doing whatever they can to make the game the best. And to have technological oversight of all of these things is very difficult. </em></p>



<p><em>A lot of these teams have some very experienced people, but a lot of them are not that experienced. They're coming in with two to five years. And I've been in the industry now for 35 years, built my own engines. <strong>At the end of the day, optimization is really hard</strong>. When you have an all-around engine like Unreal Engine 5, it's going to be good at everything. But if you're going to make a racing game versus an open world RPG versus a 2D game, <strong>the optimizations are extremely different, and you have to know your game to get in there and optimize it</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>The sad reality of the video game industry right now is <strong>it's in such poor shape that most companies don't even have time to optimize</strong>. The game's working, they ship it, it gets out there, and they haven't spent any time optimizing it, and it runs like hell. It's not the engine's fault. It's actually the state of the industry. Since we talked last, t<strong>here have been a few Black Swan events and also what I would call an extinction-level event as well</strong>. The ramifications of the extinction-level event are still happening. A lot of my colleagues are gone and a lot of the money that used to be in the industry is gone. We're going to continue to see over the next 2 to 3 years, maybe 4, a lot of the relics of the mistakes that were made before continue to happen until a lot of that gets fixed up. </em></p>



<p><em>But what it means is if you're going to optimize a game, you're not putting in any content, and all you're doing is trying to make it run faster and be better. <strong>There are a lot of people who think that's not worth it. Just put more content in, get people excited about all the new stuff in the game, and, you know, forget optimization</strong>. So, my opinion is it's definitely not the engine's fault. It's more of the state of the industry.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, Dyack clarified what he meant by "extinction-level event". He was referring to the infamous "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformative $2 billion deal</a></strong>" that the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> was negotiating with the <strong>Savvy Group</strong> before <strong>it fell through at the last minute</strong> in May 2023. Embracer Group's stock crashed, but that was just the beginning. Over the following months and years, Embracer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to sell off</a> most of its many studios</strong>, recouping what capital it could while keeping only a small number in its portfolio. </p>



<p>This, in turn, meant that when Embracer started liquidating its studios and shelving its projects, <strong>all those prototypes, built with tens of millions of dollars of Embracer's substantial capital, suddenly flooded the market as publishers scrambled to pick up new titles</strong>. These were demos built with budgets that independent developers could never match. They looked exceptional precisely because enormous amounts of money had already been poured into them.</p>



<p>Every publisher and platform holder looked at this sudden influx of polished, well-funded prototypes and naturally gravitated toward them. <strong>The pipeline of publishing slots filled up fast</strong>, while<strong> independent developers who had been going through the normal process of pitching their own, often far more modestly produced prototypes, got pushed further and further back in the queue</strong>. In many cases, these small studios <strong>simply ran out of money before they ever reached the front</strong>. </p>



<p>According to Dyack, <strong>50 to 70% of independent and mid-sized developers are now gone entirely</strong>, and in most instances, they were studios that had been running for several years, if not decades. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dyack expressed gratitude that his team, Apocalypse Studios, is still up and running amid this widespread catastrophe. On that note, he provided some news about Deadhaus Sonata: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo is available for download now via Steam</a></strong>, and the goal is to <strong>launch an early access version of the game later this year</strong> at $19.99. This initial version will only feature the vampire class, but more content will be added over the course of the 18-month-long early access, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>7 Total Playable Classes</li>



<li>New Areas, Dungeons, Towers, and other locations.</li>



<li>Hundreds of Tarot Cards and Inscriptions</li>



<li>Additional challenges and achievements that will grant the most powerful Inscriptions</li>



<li>Community-generated Content tools that integrate directly into the game, allowing Gamers to Create Content within the Deadhaus Sonata world. The community will be able to create Dungeons, Campaigns, Cities, Specific Items, Stories Lines</li>



<li>Character Customization Options</li>



<li>Enemy Types and Bosses</li>



<li>Additional Stories and Quest lines</li>



<li>Voice acting, dialogue, in-game cinematics</li>



<li>Social Features like text chat and voice chat</li>
</ul>



<p>The full version of Deadhaus Sonata <strong>will be free-to-play with cosmetic microtransactions for monetization</strong>.</p>
