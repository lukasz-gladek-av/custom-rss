			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the co-founders of Infinity Ward and Respawn Entertainment, and arguably one of the most renowned creators in the video game industry in terms of first-person shooters, as a co-creator of Call of Duty, and as a lead for Apex Legends, and most recently Battlefield, died in a car crash over the weekend in Southern California. </p>



<p>The tragic news comes from <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">an NBCLA report</a>, which outlines that it was a single-car crash that was reported to the authorities at 12:45 pm on Sunday, December 21, 2025, with the vehicle hitting a concrete barrier, trapping the driver in the car as it caught on fire and ejecting the passenger. </p>



<p>Zampella was only 55 years old at the time of his death, and his loss is one that the video game industry will be feeling for years to come. He'd <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/">taken over direction of the Battlefield franchise</a> and had also taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">a major role within EA as one of the company's leads under its EA Entertainment branch</a>, in recent years, though he's mostly known for his time at Infinity Ward, where he was one of the key leads behind the original Modern Warfare series within the Call of Duty franchise.</p>



<p>The news has prompted several developers and industry figures to share some words about Zampella and  the impact he had on the industry and on their lives, and to offer condolences to his family, who are the ones, more than anyone, who will feel his loss the most.</p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals launched towards the very end of 2024 and kicked off 2025 as one of the most popular games of the year right off the top. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">breaking records in December 2024</a>, and kept that momentum going in January 2025 with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">644K concurrent players and $135 million earned in gross revenue</a>.</p>



<p>To say that Marvel Rivals started off with a bang would be an understatement, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">it hasn't kept up the kinds of player concurrent numbers that see it go over half a million players on one platform alone</a>, at least on Steam, it has consistently stayed near or above 100K concurrent players, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">made multiple appearances</a> in Newzoo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">top ten games by monthly active users</a> throughout the year.</p>



<p>But all of that, according to producer Danny Koo, was "<em>just a warm-up</em>." Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">Den of Geek</a>, Koo said, "<em>2025 was more of a warm-up period for us</em>. <em>Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it</em>."</p>



<p>NetEase publishing and marketing lead, Yachen Bian, in the same interview added, "<em>In the next year, we want to provide more game modes</em>. <em>It’s why we have prototypes in the game, like PvE and 18v18. We want to give the players more choices of different game modes beyond the basic gameplay because your fundamental experience might be very different. When you’re fighting against zombies, it’s quite different from fighting against other people.</em>"</p>



<p>It's difficult to imagine what even more success looks like for Marvel Rivals, considering it was already one of 2025's most successful new games on the market, as it seems to have definitively carved out a place for itself in the highly competitive free-to-play shooter genre.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a lot of hard work and it always feels different and exciting</em>," Koo continued. "<em>This game is releasing new content every week. Even my own team comes in every day asking what's new today. Everyone's excited. They want to continue to make this happen. Everyone wants to make this the biggest game possible</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how NetEase continues to direct Marvel Rivals, and if it can sustain the engagement it enjoyed in the past year, and potentially even grow it further.</p>
