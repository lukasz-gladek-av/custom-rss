			<p>The rumored portable PlayStation 6 will be able to run PlayStation 5 games without developer intervention, although a patch may still be needed for performance.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-6#post-270341318"> NeoGAF forums</a>, known leaker KeplerL2 revealed today that, as far as they know, the portable system has shader binary compatibility, so it should be able to run previous-generation games without developer intervention. However, performance may not be great if games are left unpatched.</p>
<p>A portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is said to be in the works alongside the standard home variant. While the systems have yet to be officially announced, we already know they will be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, like their two immediate predecessors, although Intel reportedly bid to produce the system. According to some recent rumors, the portable edition of the next-generation system by Sony will not be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/"> match the current generation base PlayStation 5</a>, but will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> more powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and its SoC, which will feature less than 40 CUs, has been designed to run at very low voltages.</p>
<p>The regular edition of the PlayStation 6, on the other hand, hasn't been the subject of too many rumors, but Sony is reportedly planning to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful system of its console generation</a>, expanding ray tracing and machine learning to offer advanced and innovative gameplay features.</p>

			<p>Bethesda Softworks and id Software have published the second official DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer at a rather unusual time and date, late on Sunday night (at Easter, no less). Still, it was a nice surprise for fans, to be sure, and the official YouTube channel already shows half a million views in the span of mere hours.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a cinematic trailer, not a gameplay trailer. It's entirely focused on story bits, which reflects what id Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the press</a> when they first discussed the game a couple of months ago: the plot will be more important than ever in a DOOM game. Of course, there's a lot more to DOOM: The Dark Ages, which they described as the most expansive franchise installment yet:</p>
<p><em><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</em></p>

<p>Last month, Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with the game at a press event</a>, and his take was very positive:</p>
<p><em>This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</em></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will launch on May 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and path tracing</a>. There are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>, which wouldn't be at all surprising considering that both previous games were released for the original Switch console.</p>

			<p>We might be mere hours before the announcement and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914036912509407602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Detective Seeds</a> (the post has now been removed <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914046038907772973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at someone's request</a>), the game could launch tomorrow at 12 PM Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the excited community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k3kq3i/page_on_virtuous_website_for_oblivion_remastered/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found traces</a> on the Bing search engine of a dedicated game page on the website of Virtuos, the studio behind the remaster.&nbsp; Whether it's really coming out tomorrow or not, multiple insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concur</a> that Oblivion Remastered should shadow drop sometime in the coming week. Let's recap its history of leaks and rumors, then.</p>
<p>In September 2023, an internal document shared as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft trial <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda planned to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 remaster, which, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-3-remaster-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is further away from release</a>, according to the latest rumors).</p>
<p>After well over a year of no further info, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report in January 2025</a> (based on the resume of a former Virtuos employee) not only discovered that Oblivion Remastered was indeed coming, but also revealed a lot of its features. It would be powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and it would feature improvements in six key areas: HUD (Heads-Up Display), Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, and Hit Reactions. Earlier this week, the first screenshots were found online on a Virtuos webpage, previewing the massive graphics improvements that players will be able to witness.</p>
<p>Now that the remaster is nearly official, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a comment from Rebelzize</a>, Project Leader of the total conversion mod Skyblivion, also scheduled to launch in 2025 after nearly a decade of work in the team's spare time. Rebelzize maintained a positive outlook, focusing on the experience gained and on the project's uniqueness instead:</p>
<p><em>Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Are you eager to step back into Cyrodiil once again? If so, do you plan to play the official remaster or the fan-made one? Let us know below!</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #210: Next-Gen Sony Handheld , Cyberpunk DLSS on Switch 2, Docked VRR In Question" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z44nLuk4m-8?start=1216&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>
