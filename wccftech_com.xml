			<p>It's been a little more than a year since Tencent and its Polaris Quest subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>Light of Motiram</strong> to the world. This open world game was targeting a launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. Ever since we laid our eyes on it, though, we couldn't help but label it as a <strong>Horizon Zero Dawn clone</strong>.</p>



<p>There were some differences in the gameplay mechanics, such as base building, which is absent (so far, at least) in Guerrilla's acclaimed series. However, the backdrop of a destroyed world, animal-inspired machines, and a red-haired female character made it just too much of a blatant rip-off.</p>



<p>Surely enough, in late July 2025, Sony (the parent company of Horizon Zero Dawn creator Guerrilla Games) <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Tencent</a> for copyright and trademark infringement, calling Light of Motiram a 'slavish clone' of its intellectual property. Just a few days later, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began adjusting the game's description and images on Steam</a>, including removing screenshots featuring the aforementioned Aloy-inspired character.</p>



<p>In September, the Chinese corporation <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought back in court</a>, filing a motion to dismiss with a series of counters, such as jurisdiction issues and, most interestingly, arguing that Guerrilla admitted its own game was originally discarded as an internal pitch because the developers felt it was too similar to another, Ninja Theory's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, before returning to the pitch and going forward with it anyway. This was intended to demonstrate that Horizon was never truly original to begin with.</p>



<p>Predictably, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed this rebuttal as nonsense</a> and moved forward with the lawsuit. Two weeks ago, the PlayStation company s<a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ucceeded in getting Tencent to stop promoting the game</a> ahead of new court dates set for January 2026. However, it seems like that won't be necessary.</p>



<p>A quick search on Steam will show that Light of Motiram can no longer be found on Valve's platform. SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals</a> that the app 'has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store'. The last piece of info comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, which got a comment from Sony: the two companies reached a private resolution and won't share any further public comments on the topic, but they 'look forward to working together in the future'. </p>



<p>From the sound of it, then, <strong>Light of Motiram appears to have been canceled</strong>, with Tencent finally ceding to Sony's concerns without going into a prolonged legal battle it was likely to lose. </p>



<p>For all those players looking for an online version of Horizon, there's the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steel Frontiers MMORPG</a> in development by NCSOFT for PC and mobile (with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible PlayStation 5 version under discussion</a>). Guerrilla Games is also still <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing its own online co-op game</a> set within the franchise.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games has <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Hogwarts Legacy has now surpassed <strong>40 million units</strong> across all the platforms it's available on (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2). It is unclear whether they are counting the free redemptions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store's promotion</a> (which ends in a few hours, so hurry if you're interested in adding the game to your library). We've asked WB Games and will update this post if they respond.</p>



<p>Avalanche Software's open world action/adventure game set in the Wizarding World launched in February 2023 to very positive critical and fan <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>, despite a call to boycott it due to Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's (who had no direct involvement with the game) views on transgender people.</p>



<p>It didn't take long for Hogwarts Legacy to start breaking sales records:</p>



<ul>
<li>Just a couple of weeks after launch, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-works-magic-for-warner-bros-biggest-launch-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it became the <strong>best-selling launch ever in the publisher's history</strong>;</li>



<li>By May 2023, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-earned-over-1-billion-in-retail-sold-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over 15 million units and earned <strong>more than one billion dollars</strong> at retail alone;</li>



<li>By January 2024, WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Hogwarts Legacy had surpassed 22 million units and established itself as the <strong>best-selling game of 2023</strong> in a year full of triple-A releases;</li>



<li>Later that month, the publisher could <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-24-million-units-new-features-and-ex-playstation-exclusive-content-coming-in-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirm</a> a new sales milestone, 24 million units, while also announcing new features coming with patches and also that previously exclusive PlayStation content would be available elsewhere, too;</li>



<li>By November 2024, Hogwarts Legacy had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the threshold of 30 million units</a>, and the publisher predictably confirmed that a sequel was their biggest priority.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier in 2024, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a Definitive Edition was in the works with the help of Rocksteady (Batman: Arkham trilogy, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League). The goal <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was to add between 10 and 15 hours of new content</a>, but eventually, the publisher worried that the amount of new stuff wouldn't be enough to justify their estimated asking price of $30 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled this edition</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Hogwarts Legacy 2 is absolutely coming, and based on rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's not going to be a game-as-a-service</a>, even though Warner Bros. execs previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it very clear</a> that they were looking to transfer this level of success to an ongoing live service game. That's likely going to be a separate project.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that even with the outstanding sales performance of Avalanche Software's game, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down several studios</a> (Monolith Productions, Player First Games, San Diego Studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructure around its four key franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones). Ultimately, everything will be up to the winning company in the bidding war between <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, with the former already <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making it clear that WB Games is just a nice bonus</a>, as far as they're concerned, in the megadeal.</p>
