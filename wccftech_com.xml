			<p>Today, Netmarble announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will have its full launch as a free-to-play title on May 21, when the game will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, and Windows Launcher, and on mobile devices via Android or iOS across the world with the exception of Asia, which will have to wait until later this year. The online action/adventure/RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-enters-early-access-on-march-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on Steam Early Access on March 26</a>; the developers have introduced several fixes and improvements based on community feedback over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Recently, Game Director Hyunil Jang outlined the game's roadmap with the following letter to the community:</p>
<p><em>First, let's talk about field boss matchmaking. Field bosses are multiplayer content that allows up to 12 players to participate together. During the early access period, we had them spawn frequently so that many players could take part. However, we noticed that because they appeared so often, players were more spread out and it actually made it harder for groups to come together and enjoy the content fully. To improve this, we're planning to reduce the number of times Drogon appears each day. We understand this will lower the number of attempts players can make, but we believe it's more important to create an environment where people can enjoy the content together. That said, if this change doesn't have the positive impact we're hoping for, we'll absolutely listen to your feedback and make adjustments again. </em></p>
<p><em>Among the feedback to the early access version of the game and the closed beta we had earlier, there were a lot of requests about additional language support. We're happy to let you know that we plan to support Portuguese and Turkish at launch.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] Next, I want to talk about the Founder's Pack and the availability of optional purchasable items within the game. For those who joined early access through the Founder's Packs, these were designed to include a sample of the various purchasable items that will be available at launch. To thank our Founder's Packs players for helping us fine-tune Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, additional costumes that can be used by all classes were sent to all players who purchased the Founder's </em><em>Packs. We're also preparing additional rewards for early access players before the official launch. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is designed with player control in mind, ensuring a rich and rewarding experience regardless of optional purchasable items, as they are not essential to fully enjoy all aspects of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>Next, I'd like to talk about the RP system. We closely reviewed player feedback and gameplay patterns from early access and we identified several areas for improvement which we're currently working on. One of the biggest points was a shortage of RP. The original intent of the RP system was to help manage fatigue and ensure players could still earn meaningful rewards even with limited play time. However, many of you shared that the current RP supply felt too low, which made the overall experience less satisfying. We completely understand this concern, and the team is actively discussing balance adjustments to increase the daily amount of RP provided.</em></p>
<p><em>Another point we heard was that there isn't too much to do once RP runs out. Right now, players can still take part in content like field bosses or explore Westeros after using up their RP, but we </em><em>agree there's room to offer more. We're working on adding new types of content, including exploration challenges and co-op content, to keep things engaging even beyond RP. </em></p>
<p><em>If you've played our early access build, you'll have already explored the snowy regions of the North, the stained opulence of the Red Keep, and the lush green meadows of the Reach. Ultimately, our goal is to bring the entirety of Westeros to life with that same level of detail and authenticity. The next region we'll be visiting is one that hasn't received a lot of love in either the books or the show: the Stormlands, ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Our level and background teams work very hard to give each region its own distinct vibe, and the Stormlands live up to their name with a dark and oppressive feel and atmosphere matching the region's tone.</em></p>
<p><em>The narrative for this next chapter will be slightly darker as well. We'll dive a little more into the aspects of religion and what it would mean to a medieval society like that of Westeros to have</em><br>
<em>their king suddenly declare that all the people under his rule are now obliged to change their faith to that of a god whose name they can't even pronounce. </em></p>
<p><em>Our aim has always been to deliver a more polished and complete experience, but we recognized that there were areas like bugs and overall stability where we still have work to do. There may still be moments ahead where things don't meet expectations, but when that happens, we're committed to responding quickly, addressing issues and keeping communication open. As we work to improve, we'll continue working to make Game of Thrones: Kingsroad even better. Moving forward, our goal is to keep listening closely to your feedback and provide gaming service in a way that reflects our voices.</em></p>

			<p><strong>Update 29/02/2025:&nbsp;</strong>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc">Bloomberg</a> clarifies that somewhere between 300-400 developers have been laid off at EA, with approximately 100 of those cuts coming from Respawn.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the incubation project EA canceled was under the codename R7, and was an extraction shooter set within the world of Titanfall.</p>
<p>In a statement on the cuts, EA spokesperson Justin Higgs said, "<em>As part of our continued focus for our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>EA has canceled yet another project that was in an early incubation stage at Respawn, one month after it canceled a<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> multiplayer project at the same stage</a>, and according to a report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-lays-off-unknown-number-of-individuals-again"> IGN</a>, EA will also be laying off an unknown number of employees at Respawn across the Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation teams.</p>
<p>In a statement published to <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">X</a>, Respawn announces that it has "<em>made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects</em>," which refers to the project canceled last month, and another cancellation we're hearing about today for the first time. Respawn continues to add that there will be layoffs across the Apex Legends and Star Wars teams, though it doesn't mention the cuts to the incubation team, which come from IGN's sources.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many people have been cut from Respawn, though the cuts are reportedly being made across departments and aren't focused on one part of the studio.</p>
<p>"<em>As we sharpen our focus for the future, we've made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects and make some targeted team adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi. These decisions aren't easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected - their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We're offering meaningful support to those impacts, including exploring new opportunities within EA,</em>" the studio's statement reads.</p>
<p>The statement also addressed what these cuts mean for Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi, saying of the former that&nbsp;"<em>while the team will continue to refine gameplay and bring new ideas to upcoming seasons, we're also investing in what's next for the franchise - exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition</em>."</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, Respawn simply added, "<em>We're excited to keep building new stories</em>—<em>with the next chapter of the Star Wars Jedi series aiming to raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>The booming success of Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi series in 2019 has, in many ways, made Respawn the crown jewel studio for EA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">entertainment side</a> of the business. But it's worth asking how long it could keep that status if EA consistently shuts down the new ideas the developers at Respawn come up with.</p>
