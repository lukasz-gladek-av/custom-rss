			<p>When Xbox PR reached out about a digital preview for The Outer Worlds 2, I literally beamed at the opportunity. They had done exactly the same for Avowed a couple of months ahead of that Obsidian RPG's launch, and that demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did a lot to get me even more hyped for the final game</a>. It was an extensive demo that provided more or less free rein to roam Avowed's first region of Dawnshore, explore it, and get a proper taste of what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full game would be all about</a>. It also included companions, who are always a big part of Obsidian's roleplaying games, as fans of the Irvine-based studio know all too well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the demo that was shared for The Outer Worlds 2 is much more limited. It starts at what appears to be the very beginning of the game; in that regard, it's akin to Avowed. However, whereas the latter game's demo went much further than the tutorial mission, this one does not. I learned afterward that it was the same demo available at Gamescom 2025, and it would have made sense there given the one-hour slot limit, but for a digital preview, it is a thorough disappointment. </p>



<p>The demo doesn't even provide access to companions, so you're completely on your own for the mission. Moreover, it does not include any explorable zone like the aforementioned Dawnshore from Avowed. This <span>straightforward mission doesn't really showcase the '<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/" target="_blank">much more expansive worlds</a>' touted by the developer in recent The Outer Worlds 2 media blasts, or the many new cool gadgets&nbsp;</span>showcased in previous videos.</p>



<p>Sure, there were a couple of different paths to take while going through the mission. You can, for example, use the Eloquence skill (provided that you've picked it up when creating your character) to convince an NPC to disable the automated security and get you into the facility without having to fight the robots. You can also use other skills like Hacking or Engineering or Lockpicking to unlock specific doors. But all those features were already in the first The Outer Worlds game. I hoped to get a peek at what's new and improved, but this build didn't have much of that.</p>



<p>It did have the option to play in third-person view, which was completely absent from the previous installment. You will have to select it from the game's options, and there are two choices: a close third-person camera and a far one. Honestly, though, just like with Avowed, I believe they are there more for accessibility reasons than a genuine alternative. It's fine if you just cannot stomach first-person due to health concerns like motion sickness, but otherwise, you're much better off with first-person; the animations do not look nearly as good in third-person.</p>



<p>Another thing that Obsidian said it improved in The Outer Worlds 2 is the shooting part, which was refined based on feedback from Halo Studios and the analysis of Bungie's Destiny. The improvements are definitely there; shooting feels more solid, but still not quite as good as a top-notch shooter. Melee combat, unfortunately, still doesn't appear to be as in-depth as Avowed, and the lack of a dodge button certainly does not help.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The combat gameplay relies heavily on the 'Tactical Time Dilation' device (which also returns from the original title). This device allows the player to slow down time, which is essential if you want to survive against multiple foes at higher difficulty levels. The sequel does add destructible cover, but again, this was not featured in the demo build.</p>



<p>Lastly, from a technical standpoint, The Outer Worlds 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4. The visual improvement compared to the original is noticeable but perhaps slightly less significant than I would have hoped, even with ray traced lighting, shadows, and reflections enabled. The game also already supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, although the implementation might still need some tweaking. </p>



<p>On PC, the graphics settings already offer plenty of options for users to tinker with, including a built-in frame rate limiter, five upscaling options (TAA, TSR, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS, the only one to support Frame Generation), a slider for Field of View, and a toggle for Chromatic Aberration. On my RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the demo ran smoothly without any stuttering, but like I said, it was a small level. The real test will be on those larger open-ended areas. Given that the game will launch simultaneously on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, I hoped to see support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and/or adaptive triggers, but there seems to be only regular rumble.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite the fairly disappointed tone of this preview, I am still confident that Obsidian will deliver a meaty, fun, and enjoyable roleplaying game with The Outer Worlds 2. It's just that the demo they provided did not give us much of an opportunity to discover its new features and improvements.</p>



<p>Still, the full game is just two months away from being released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Look forward to our review ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned October 29 launch</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As I’ve been shouting from the rooftops for years now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> is one of the most criminally-underrated Switch exclusives, so I was quite happy when it was revealed it would be one of the first OG Switch titles to get a fancy Switch 2 update. Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World adds both a new layer of polish to the game's presentation and a significant amount of fresh content for Kirby-hungry fans to devour.</p>



<p>So, is the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land a well-rounded meal? Or will it leave a bad taste in your mouth? Float onward for the answer...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I mentioned following my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions">previous brief hands-on time</a> with the upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, the game is the best-looking of the initial batch of Switch 2 updates to my eye. Per Nintendo itself, the game now runs at 1440p, but that resolution seems less dynamic than some other Switch 2 upgrades, as the game simply looks sharper than, say, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on">Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Of course, it could be that the original game’s assets were just more detailed and suited to this kind of upgrade, as it’s one of the most impressive-looking Switch titles. Now, it’s one of the most impressive-looking <em>Switch 2</em> titles – crisp, colorful, and bursting with personality. Oh, and yes, the bump to 60fps is definitely felt. The game was perfectly playable at 30fps, but everything feels just a little nicer at 60fps. I really can't find any fault with this game's technical upgrade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But the visual upgrade is just the beginning. The Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land also comes with what’s essentially a whole new DLC mini-campaign, Star-Crossed World, available any time after completing the original game’s first world. A mysterious meteor crashes to earth, causing an imposing volcanic island to rise from the ocean. On this island, our pink hero comes across the heart-shaped “Star of Darkness,” which seems more than a little ominous, so Kirby sets about rescuing "Starries," who have the power to contain the darkness (these little alien guys are basically this DLC’s version of the original game’s Waddle Dees).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Star-Crossed World campaign tasks players with revisiting several stages from the original game (2 per world, for a total of 12 remixed stages), which are now littered with crystals and “Starryflowers,” which can be broken to reveal new, glowing crystalline pathways. All this crystally stuff also affects the game’s enemies and minibosses, making them a somewhat-stiffer challenge. Additionally, there are a few new “Mouthful Mode” transformations, including a bouncy spring, a wall-climbing gear, and a sign that can be used for fun, slippy-slidy sledding sections. Several classic Mouthful transformations also return and are used in fun and sometimes unique ways.</p>



<p>Now, when I first saw the description and trailers for Star-Crossed World, I would say I was only <em>moderately </em>excited. I figured I'd basically be playing through familiar stages, just a little tougher, a little different. Thankfully, that’s not really the case. For instance, in the Star-Crossed World version of the Abandoned Beach stage things begin as usual, but then, after less than a minute, the sea literally parts, revealing a rainbow-coral-coated ocean floor. What follows is almost an entirely-different level than the one in the original game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case for pretty much all of these remixed “Starry Stages.” Level themes and assets may be reused, but these are essentially completely new stage layouts, and they're just as fun, sometimes <em>moreso</em>, than those in the excellent original game. These stages are also packed with all the usual secrets, including hidden Starries and a whole new set of collectible capsule figurines. You can also tackle a new extra-tough Colosseum run, and as you might expect, there's a daunting final challenge waiting for you once you've completed all the Starry Stages.</p>



<p>Granted, there are some things missing from this DLC. There are no new regular copy abilities or Treasure Road challenge stages here, but then again, this isn't a full sequel. For an extra 20 dollars you're getting a solid 4 to 5 hours of additional content, and those who want to 100 percent everything can always go back for second helpings. </p>

<p><strong>An Early Switch 2 Super Star</strong></p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World launches on August 28. Those who already own the Switch version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

			<p>Despite having been out for well over a year, players are still making some interesting discoveries in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth highlighting the amazing depth of its combat system which is sadly left unexplored due to the game's generally low difficulty level.</p>



<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2052brad">Brad Man</a> shared on YouTube two videos highlighting the hidden properties of Tifa's Overpower ability and Red XIII's Crescent Claws and Reaper Touch. The hidden properties of Overpower, in particular, can completely shake up combat, allowing Tifa and the rest of the party to interrupt and launch in the air even heavier enemies, resulting in a more satisfying experience. As such, it's really weird how the game doesn't provide any information on these mechanics, ultimately ending up reinforcing the wrong idea that some have regarding what is, in my opinion, one of the best combat systems seen in modern role-playing games.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>As mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was originally released on PlayStation 5 on February 29 2024, and was ported one year later on PC. Although plenty of mods have been released on PC to improve the experience and introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-requested-feature/">features and mechanics</a> not available in the vanilla version of the game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that's more than worthy experiencing, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. With Final Fantasy VII Remake hitting the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S soon, there's little doubt the rest of the trilogy will eventually make its way onto every modern gaming platform at some point.</p>
