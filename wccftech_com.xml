			<p>While most franchise fans are primarily interested in the gameplay of Battlefield 6 for the various multiplayer modes, the game is also going to feature a full-fledged campaign, unlike Battlefield 2042. Earlier this week, Inverse <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to interview</a> some of the lead developers from Motive Studios, the team in charge of the single player story mode, who shared some of the inspirations and themes players will see in the game.</p>
<p>Creative Director Roman Campos-Oriola said:</p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of Lioness.</em></p>
<p>Executive Producer Philippe Ducharme:</p>
<p><em>I really enjoyed Civil War. Some of the things that we’re pushing [in the Battlefield 6 campaign], the film is actually a good reference.</em></p>
<p>They're referring to Lioness, the American spy action thriller TV show released on Paramount+ with Zoe Saldaña as the main character, and Civil War, Alex Garland's dystopic action thriller movie where a despotic federal government and secessionist movements fight a bloody war within the United States. Both are great examples of action thriller plots, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Campos-Oriola then had this to say about the themes that will be explored in the Battlefield 6 story:</p>
<p><em>The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two discussed how their previous work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Space remake</a> helped them prepare for the Battlefield 6 campaign project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that was a remake, but this time, Motive (which is also helping DICE produce multiplayer maps) had to do everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;this Summer for a launch window scheduled before April 2026.</p>
