			<p>A remaster of The Sinking City, the Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective game released back in 2019 by Frogwares on PC and consoles, has been announced today ahead of the end of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/">sequel</a>'s <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/">Kickstarter campaign</a> conclusion.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remaster, which will be available for free to all owners of the original game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, will feature an upgraded visual experience, sporting 4K textures, new lighting, improved detail and reflections, 4K textures, support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and TSR upscaling and more. The Sinking City Remastered will also feature some requested quality-of-life features as well as a brand-new Photo Mode, providing players with plenty of reasons to dive back into the flooded city of Oakmont together with Charles Reed.</p>

<p>The upgraded visuals featured in The Sinking City Remastered will make the experience even more immersive, as the original game definitely nailed the atmosphere. Hopefully, the quality-of-life improvements will make the game more fun to play, especially the combat, which I found pretty lacking compared to the excellent investigation mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-sinking-city-strongest-fear-unknown/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Sinking City is probably the best Lovecraft-inspired game currently available on the market, thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and its story, which utilizes the lore masterfully without deviating from the canon. AI and technical issues, as well as the clunky combat, are often immersion-breaking, but the excellent investigation mechanics and exploration features make it easy to look past these issues. Highly recommended to survival horror fans and those who live and breathe Lovecraft.</em></p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The April Fool's dating sim from Pocketpair has made a return, and this time, it doesn't seem to be a joke. Last year, Pocketpair released a trailer for a dating sim called Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, where it was released as an April Fools joke.</p>
<p>However, today, Pocketpair has released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, an the game seems legitimate and actively developing. So, for those who want to date some of the pals you find in Palworld, this will be your opportunity. There is now an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active Steam page</a> for the game, where you can wishlist it and get a little bit more information about what the game will be.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer that was released today by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Palworld developers</a>. From the description on the YouTube video, it seems that the game will be available to wishlist on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Thus far, there is no mention of whether this will be available on Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ | 2nd trailer | Palworld | Pocketpair" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you enroll as a transfer student in the Palpagos Private Academy, where you will be introduced to some unique friends (pals) and get to enjoy the school life alongside them, with the option to romance them along the way. You can choose whether you stay friends with them or work on a romantic relationship with them. There is also the third option of dismembering and eating them if you want a touch of horror to your gaming experience.</p>
<p>The Steam Page for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ also reveals some of the students that you will meet, including Lovander, Chillet, Zoe, Chillet Ignis, Quivern, Nurse Saya, Tarantriss, and more. It seems that there is a wide range of options for those who want to participate in learning the stories of each character, with some seeming on a bit of the darker side of things.</p>
<p>From the screenshots available, it seems to share similarities to Doki Doki Literature Club, luring you into a false sense of security. There are two trailers for the game, with one of them being the trailer that was released as an April Fool's joke last year.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for this title, and the announcement has come very suspiciously close to April Fool's once again. The Pocketpair Community Manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, assured Eurogamer that this is, in fact, legitimate and not another April Fool's joke.</p>
<p>So, will you be playing Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~?</p>

			<p>Few people predicted the triumphant return of DOOM in 2016. Bethesda was unwilling to have games reviewed before launch. The overwhelming feeling was that the game wouldn't be as good as they had hoped from DOOM, with the prior multiplayer beta underwhelming players. Needless to say, DOOM was great, DOOM Eternal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which I reviewed</a>, was also great, and now we have DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Or, at least, we will have DOOM: The Dark Ages. I recently got hands-on experience with the first level of the game and the first portion of the second. Then, parts of two later levels, before an even later - open - level, for a chunk of time. Essentially, ID Software and Bethesda wanted me and others at the event in Frankfurt to have a feel for what the game will offer and its variety.</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on memory here, but something that I wasn't a massive fan of in DOOM Eternal, in retrospect, was that it had gone quite platform-heavy in some areas. Not enough that I expected an Italian plumber to show up, but maybe a Gecko dressed like a spy. Somebody at ID Software must have agreed because this has been toned back significantly, though the verticality isn't lost from what I have seen here.</p>
<p>No, the first level I could play feels like DOOM as we know it. The maps are large; you have several secrets to find if you choose to, and little bits of exploration may also net you extra health and armour. This is in between moving from one arena, where you kill hordes of enemies, to the corridors in between until you reach the next arena. So far, so DOOM. It's what you would expect, too, and my initial impression is that it brings the tight combat from DOOM Eternal to the tighter design of DOOM 2016.</p>

<p>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</p>
<p>The dragon, however, I'm not entirely as sold on. Now, when I get more time with it, I could be blown out of the water - it needs to be remembered that I played part of a level. The initial rush of zooming out of a cave system on the back of a dragon is pretty impressive. Particularly so, when you see the level of devastation happening, you will be there, fighting off giant hell-ships, and the sense of scale is awe-inspiring, even at first glance.</p>
<p>This isn't a case of more artificial corridors moving from ship to ship. You will fly around, and there are extra things to defeat and paths to find before you weaken a ship's defences enough to land on it and deal the finishing blow. Of course, the last part is done on foot, and you go around areas bigger than just the ship as it has crashed into the city below. All of that was good. I wasn't enthralled by the combat on the dragon itself, if only because, once locked on, the controls felt a little too rigid. It's an area I am looking forward to exploring more.</p>

<p>Understandably, ID Software knew DOOM: The Dark Ages would shine in a later area they had us play, giving us an hour to do what we wanted. This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</p>
<p>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the narrative of DOOM: The Dark Ages. This is an entirely single-player-focused title, and I am all on board with that. I have zero interest in multiplayer; anybody who knows me knows that my time on this planet has been one of ensuring humans keep as far away from my fun as possible. This focus on single-player also means that resources haven't been diverted, and there's no need to start balancing guns, melee weapons, or any other nonsense about how they work around other people. No, this is about the DOOM Slayer, his time before DOOM, and the medieval-ish world he came from.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will be released on May 13th, 2025, if you buy the premium edition, or on May 15th if you don't. Needless to say, after the resounding success of both DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal, and what was a very fun time I had with the game in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
