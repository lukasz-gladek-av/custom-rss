			<p>The long absent remake of the beloved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still nowhere to be see, but fans of the game and the Star Wars universe in general have something great to look forward to: Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>Announced with an exciting teaser shared during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, the game developed by Arcanaut Studios in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games is a new single-player narrative-driven action RPG, and spiritual successor of the aforementioned Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p><em>"Led by Casey Hudson, Game director of the original Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy, the team of veteran game developers and storytellers at Arcanaut Studios is crafting an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness,"</em> the game's official description reads.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the trailer did not confirm the game's release window. However, it did confirm that <em>"cinematic scenes"</em> were captured in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

			<p>Bradley the Badger was one of the pre-show announcements for<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"> The Game Awards 2025</a>, and was one of the more exciting reveals to kick off the night, as Hollywood actor Evan Peters stars in what appears to be a surreal 3D platformer that is described as <em>"a love letter to games</em>" on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">Steam page</a>, from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-lead-designer-mario-rabbids-director-announce-new-development-studio-day-4-night/">developers at Day 4 Night, a team formed by Davide Soliani and other former Mario Rabids and Red Dead Redemption developers</a>.</p>



<p>Bradley the Badger puts you in the paws of a badger, the kind you would expect to see in a classic PlayStation 2, original Xbox and Nintendo GameCube-era game, perhaps even a generation before that. The trailer takes a turn when the seemingly family-friendly world turns into a Soulslike, Bloodborne-like nightmare. </p>



<p>From there, it jumps to a cyberpunk, sci-fi style adventure, and from there, to a dystopian The Last of Us-looking abandoned world. And along the way, you're playing around with elements of the game that are made to appear like unfinished assets that you can manipulate, or become similar to how Mario throws his cap at creatures and objects in Super Mario Odyssey to possess them.</p>

<p>The trailer makes it look like a wildly inventive game that appears to be one of the more creative and potentially innovative games to come along in some time. There's unfortunately no word as to when it'll be ready, nor is there too much information on where it'll be available. Right now, we know it's coming to PC, at least.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM has confirmed the final release date of its new sci-fi intellectual property, PRAGMATA, in a trailer that aired on The Game Awards 2025 event. The third-person action/adventure game will be released on April 24, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2, with the latter platform just added to the mix. Moreover, CAPCOM has opened pre-orders and released a demo called PRAGMATA SKETCHBOOK on Steam; more information on the demo's availability on consoles will be available at a later date.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are available for a Standard Edition at $59.99 and a Deluxe Edition at $69.99, which includes the Shelter Variety Pack. This bundle offers an assortment of alternate cosmetic outfits for Hugh and Diana, a weapon skin, emotes for Diana, extra background music for the Shelter, and an in-game library with 75 pieces of digital artwork. PRAGMATA fans can also look forward to more information coming soon about a Diana amiibo figure. As an exclusive bonus, players who pre-order either version will receive Hugh's samurai-styled Neo Bushido outfit and Diana’s ninja-inspired Neo Kunoichi costume. </p>

<p>We got an inkling that the announcement was close after the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got rated last month by the Korean rating board</a>, the GRAC. For the record, PRAGMATA received a rating of 'ages 12 and up'.</p>



<p>At some point, CAPCOM fans feared this game would go the way of Deep Down, that is to say, vanish into thin air after a promising trailer. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> during the PlayStation 5 Future of Gaming event, the game was <span>initially scheduled for release in 2022 but was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank">delayed</a>&nbsp;until</span> 2023. The developers <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/" target="_blank">released a new trailer</a>&nbsp;in June of that year, but the game disappeared again, resurfacing</span> only two years later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a trailer and a new 2026 release window</a>. </p>



<p>Since the game had pulled out this trick before, it wasn't until CAPCOM actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided hands-on time with PRAGMATA at Gamescom 2025</a> that we were convinced it was indeed coming. After playing it, we discovered it was shaping up very well, too. The twist is that Diana, a human girl-looking android helper of the protagonist Hugh, dynamically helps him hack through the otherwise impassable armor of enemy robots. In practice, this means the player has to quickly solve a hacking mini-game as the enemies get closer; only once that's done, Hugh can use his weapons to defeat them. Dodging while hacking is therefore pretty much mandatory, though Hugh can count on his jetpack to help in that regard.</p>
