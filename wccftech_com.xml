			<p>Renowned virtual reality modder Luke Ross <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that his <strong>Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod</strong> was taken down after a DMCA request from the game's developer, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>.</p>



<p>The mod allowed virtual reality gamers to experience the splendor of Night City through their headsets, significantly increasing immersion. It was originally released in <strong>late February 2022</strong>, so it's not like it's anything new. It is unclear exactly what prompted CDPR to take action now; perhaps they were simply unaware so far, and someone brought the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to their attention just recently.</p>



<p>And no, <strong>it's not that the game development studio is working on an official VR mode for their game</strong>. Luke Ross says that explicitly, having actually been able to talk this through with CDPR's VP of business development and legal department (unlike what happened a few years ago with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vr-modder-luke-ross-gets-dmca-notice-for-his-rdr2-gta-and-mafia-vr-mods/"><strong>Take-Two</strong>'s DMCA takedown of his <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>, and <strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> VR mods</a>, when Ross couldn't get through to anyone there).</p>



<p>The VR modder was very bitter in his Patreon post, complaining about the 'duplicity with which the corpo mind thinks and reacts. The bottom line is all that matters, and gamers be damned.' That said, looking at the comments on Reddit, forum boards, and social media, many gamers are not very surprised. Companies can't allow others to profit from their own IPs without a license, after all, and this could have been avoided if Ross simply released the mod for free and then asked for donations to his Patreon. </p>



<p>CD Projekt RED doesn't have any problem with free mods, as evidenced by their support of the modding communities of <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and Cyberpunk 2077. They even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the full mod tools (<strong>REDkit</strong>) for the former</a> a couple of years ago, encouraging more modders to tinker with the game. Cyberpunk 2077 is the fastest-growing game on Nexus by mod downloads, having just surpassed <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> and being only behind <strong>Skyrim</strong> (both base and Special Edition) and <strong>Fallout 4</strong> when it comes to total mod downloads.</p>



<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod <strong>was instead hidden behind the paywall</strong>, though, which prompted the legal action. That said, the modder isn't quitting. In fact, he just <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/looking-down-at-148469092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new VR mod for <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, a challenging proposition since it uses an isometric-style camera (albeit in a fully 3D game) that the modder hadn't yet converted to virtual reality. Once again, though, it is locked behind the paywall, potentially inviting legal action by license holder Wizards of the Coast.</p>



<p>In other news, VR gaming just took a major hit, with Meta <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down three of its studios</a> (<strong>Sanzaru Games</strong>, <strong>Twisted Pixel</strong>, and <strong>Armature Studio</strong>) as part of its 10% layoffs at the Reality Labs division. <strong>Camouflaj</strong>, the developer behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/republique-review-zeroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">République</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-iron-man-vr-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man VR</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also affected by layoffs</a>, canceling its Arkham Shadow sequel and reportedly abandoning any future VR gaming projects.</p>
