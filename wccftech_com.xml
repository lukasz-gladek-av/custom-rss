			<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is a new turn-based RPG from developer and publisher Epictellers Entertainment, that's currently set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 as an early access title on Steam. There's also a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight">Kickstarter campaign</a> players can register their interest in now, to be a part of the development journey for this new sci-fi fantasy adventure.</p>



<p>Set in the world of the popular tabletop role-playing game, Starfinder, this new adventure includes new characters, each with their own unique story lines, and brings Starfinder's second edition ruleset to the digital world for the first time.</p>



<p>Epictellers Entertainment will be working in collaboration with Starfinder's creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathfinder-kingmaker-crpg-chris-avellone/">Paizo</a>, on the project, but Epictellers will be the ones both publishing and leading development on the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re thrilled to unveil Starfinder: Afterlight in partnership with Paizo,</em>" said Epictellers Entertainment co-founder and chief executive officer, Ricard Pillosu, in a press release. "<em>This marks the beginning of a journey we want to take alongside Starfinder fans everywhere. We can’t wait to share more about the ragtag crew navigating the Pact Worlds, full of danger and adventure."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>For Paizo's part, publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, added, "<em>Starfinder’s universe is rich, vast, and beloved</em>. <em>Epictellers Entertainment's vision aligns perfectly with the essence of our galaxy. We believe they’re the ideal team to bring this next chapter of the franchise to life.</em>"</p>

<p>Afterlight will have you assemble six companions for your journey, each fitting into one of six categories for the turn-based fights: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. You'll travel to multiple locations in the universe and engage in a narrative-focused adventure where the choices you make will impact the outcome of the game.</p>



<p>Another interesting tidbit is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Neil Newbon</a>, the actor who many will know from <a href="https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and most recently from Surgent Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/">Dead Take</a>, is directing the voice cast.</p>



<p>Today's announcement and screenshots have provided a good foundation for what Afterlight could become, but the real test is always the first view of live gameplay. Hopefully, we'll be able to check some gameplay footage before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Starfield will reportedly launch on PlayStation 5 sometime next year, along with the game's second expansion and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>According to what unspecified sources have <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told MP1st</a>, the Xbox Series X|S console exclusive from Bethesda will not launch this year on PlayStation 5 as previously rumored, but only in 2026, in part due to the low sales of the first expansion, Shattered Space. At this time, Microsoft is leaning toward releasing Starfield during Spring 2026, together with the second yet-to-be-revealed expansion and some quality of life improvements. The announcement timeline also doesn't seem to be clear, but it's unlikely the new version of the game will be revealed later this month during this year's Gamescom, nor will it be shadowdropped like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Oblivion Remastered</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>It's not really surprising to learn that Starfield: Shattered Space isn't selling well. While the expansion's tight narrative elements and its atmosphere that borders space horror are very well done, the expansion doesn't offer anything different from the base game. The asking price also doesn't help, as it is too high for what the expansion has to offer, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the base game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 01/08/2025:</strong> Though Nintendo stated it would wait until Sunday, August 3, 2025, to unveil the new prices for the Nintendo Switch and a few specific Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, it seems that the US retailer Target has let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-switch-in-the-us-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, according to <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=nintendo+switch&amp;ignoreBrandExactness=true&amp;Nao=0&amp;facetedValue=551qz">Target's website</a>, the new prices for Nintendo Switch consoles have all increased by at least $30. The new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $339.99 USD ($40 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $229 USD ($30 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $399 USD ($50 up from previous price)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Following a similar announcement at the end of June for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorKwcamh1Em9gwHD9rlcQ7-SZ-YwKnhp8OmOX208TEZnYW1R9bQ">Canada</a>, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">announced </a>that it will change the price of the Nintendo Switch and its "<em>family of systems and products</em>," including the base Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and accessories. Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, will stay the same for now, as will pricing for its peripherals and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced the news on its official website, with a short message that doesn't specifically say how the prices will be altered, but it's unfortunately doubtful that the prices will be decreased. Just as Nintendo did for its Canada announcement, Nintendo says these changes are being made "<em>based on market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>It's also clearly a price increase because while the US price changes will be announced in just a few days on August 3, 2025, Canadians had to wait from June 30, 2025, until today, to find out what the new prices would be. To no one's surprise, they're all price increases.</p>



<p>Before today, the price of a Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite in Canada was:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $399 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $259 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $449 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, everything has been bumped up by at least $20, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/hardware/">the new prices are</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $419 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $279 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $489 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>So expect the cost of getting a Nintendo Switch console in the US to be a little more expensive when these prices go live in a few days. As a reminder, here's what the Nintendo Switch family of systems costs in the US today, before the price increases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $299 USD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $199 USD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $349 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>Nintendo also clarified that while the Nintendo Switch 2 console and most of its peripherals would not be getting a price alteration, some Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like the Alarmo clock and certain Amiibo, will get price adjustments. </p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't getting a price change now, it's a little concerning that the previous generation is getting a price bump. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling extremely</a> well so far, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs</a> potentially behind these price increases, and the Switch 2 proving that players are hungry to jump from their eight-year-old Nintendo Switch console, it makes you wonder when Nintendo will pull the lever on increasing prices for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>In its statement on price changes coming after this weekend, after stipulating that Switch 2 prices are not impacted in the changes announced today, Nintendo says, "<em>However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</em></p>
