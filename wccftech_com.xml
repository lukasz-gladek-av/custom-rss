			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/blades-of-fire/noticias/trabajadores-mercurysteam-algo-hace-bien-mercury-jugar-miedo-porque-no-hay-otro-lugar-donde-ir-industria">Spanish publication 3DJuegos</a> points to poor working conditions at MercurySteam, the studio behind Metroid Dread, and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire, which launched earlier this year</a>. The report includes interviews with both current and former members of MercurySteam's development team, who claim that the studio was mandating overtime that should have been voluntary, and that a crunch culture has been established where an eight-hour-a-day work week is an easy week compared to the new 10-hour normal.</p>



<p>According to the report, these issues began before the launch of Blades of Fire, with a new work schedule implemented called "<em></em><em>Distribucion Irregular de la Jornada</em> <em>(DIJ)</em>," which essentially meant teams within MercurySteam would be subjected to longer hours, but the overtime compensation was never directly made clear. It was also never actually mandatory, with the company's HR department admitting, after employees poked holes in the new system's implementation, that these hours were not actually mandatory.</p>



<p>According to one of the interviewed employees (<a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/mercurysteam-employees-speak-out-10-hour-workdays-unclear-policie/za879b">via translation</a>), "<em>At first, they said the extra hours were completely mandatory, without distinguishing between the DIJ hours and the new ones, and they talked about the need for overtime as if we were in some kind of crisis. They used exaggerated language to describe the company's situation, but also to cover up the fact that they were proposing unstructured and unregulated measures. They told us overtime would be assigned as needed, even though overtime legally has to be recorded and agreed upon by both parties, and there was no system in place for that</em>."</p>



<p>This new DIJ schedule was also reportedly not something that MercurySteam kept a record of, at least on paper. From the management's mouth to the employees' ears was how members of the studio learned they were on this new schedule, which has meant a new normal of 10-hour work weeks for some teams. But, critically, not for others, as some teams have yet to be submitted to the new work schedule, while others have reportedly rarely been taken off of it.</p>



<p>Issues of crunch were only exacerbated when Blades of Fire released and failed to hit sales expectations, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteams-blades-of-fire-deemed-to-have-underperformed">game's publisher publicly saying the game had "<em>underperformed</em>."</a> By that point, as teams had been crunching for months to get the game out the door, the crunch hours had become a normalized state for some developers. The report also claims that by August 2025, developers at the studio had started to get laid off, with some teams shrinking, though, once again, not all teams were treated equal, as others kept hiring.</p>



<p>Internal communications between employees have also reportedly been largely shut down, with non-work-related chats closed, and partitions set up around the office. The layoffs, crunch culture, and mixing messages from HR have all participated to a low point for employee morale, as the studio's future remains uncertain. Still, though, they are reportedly crunching on the studio's next project, which is currently unannounced.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Will Offer “A New Gaming Experience” For Players, Says Director]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-offer-%E2%80%9Ca-new-gaming-experience%E2%80%9D-for-players-says-director.1325860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game director on the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Naoki Hamaguchi, shared several small teases for players looking forward to the third and final installment of the series with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">at the Brasil Game Show 2025</a>, saying that the conclusion to this long remake project will satisfy old and new fans alike. With regard to the gameplay for Part 3, he also shared an interesting tidbit that's worth noting.</p>



<p>Specifically, Hamaguchi called out the different gameplay focuses found in each of the games. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, the focus was on a story-driven narrative. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was more about the grand open-world players got to explore, and in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, it'll be "<em>a new gaming experience</em>," according to Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>"<em>The first installment featured story-driven progression, the second part expanded upon that with an open-world design that offered greater player freedom. Building upon the second part, the third part is also being created to deliver players a new gaming experience, so please look forward to it.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Naoki Hamaguchi says he aims to give players a new gameplay experience with part 3 of the FF7 Remake trilogy!</p><p>He says his vision for the project is that just as the story changes between each game he also wants to have a new gaming experience with each entry.</p><p>“The first… <a href="https://t.co/r5QemkQEBD">pic.twitter.com/r5QemkQEBD</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1978474103972753761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In one sense, yes, this is a very vague statement. You could classify any new game as 'a new gaming experience,' but that surface-level definition is not what Hamaguchi is referring to. Instead, he's saying it won't exactly follow in Rebirth's footsteps and be all about its open world, or be like Remake, and be full-steam ahead on its story.</p>



<p>Not to say it won't be driven by those kinds of elements, but it clearly sounds like something else will take centre stage in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whether that's a stronger focus on action and combat, greater changes to the narrative and how players navigate it, or even more mini-games than what we saw in Rebirth. Only Square Enix knows what it's cooking up for this trilogy's conclusion.</p>



<p>As to when we'll get to play this third installment, again, only Square Enix and its developers know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">but according to Tetsuya Nomura</a>, Part 3 of this trilogy is on schedule, as is Kingdom Hearts 4, if you were curious. In the meantime, we can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">first two games in the trilogy heading to Xbox Series X/S consoles and the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the third game to follow once it's out on PS5 and PC.</p>
