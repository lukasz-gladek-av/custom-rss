            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the span of two months, we went from not knowing anything official about Nintendo's follow-up to its box-office smash-hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">to knowing the official title</a>, (The Super Mario Galaxy Movie), getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-says-movies-are-very-well-suited-to-nintendo-games/">more insight on how Nintendo sees its future adaptations</a>, and a very likely rumor that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">film's first major trailer is days away from premiering</a>.</p>



<p>Today, the latest update comes in the form of an unfortunate leak from a collaboration between Nintendo and Pillsbury cookies. On the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">website for American grocery store chain TopsMarkets</a>, a box of Pillsbury Cookie Dough cookies shaped like Yoshi eggs features a big, bright look at Yoshi in the film on the front of the box.</p>



<p>This is technically our second look at the character design for Yoshi in the film, since the first look came from an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2s-title-may-have-leaked-two-months-ago-in-a-photo-of-deodorant-cans/">Old Spice promotional collaboration</a> that also leaked the film's official title months before it was officially revealed. That said, this is definitely the best look at Yoshi in the coming film we've gotten so far.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What's perhaps the more interesting aspect of this leak is what we see on the back of the box. It's not a full character reveal, but it does practically confirm that one of the new characters in the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be Bowser Jr.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see Bowser Jr.'s classic symbol on the top-left side of the box, which you can bet would not be included if he were not going to be part of the film in some way. So, it would seem that slowly, but surely, we're learning more about this coming sequel all the time.</p>



<p>We should, if the rumors are true, get a brand new trailer sometime before the end of the month, since a new trailer is allegedly slated to appear ahead of the theatrical showings of Wicked: For Good, the part-two to the box-office hit adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>After that, it's a safe bet that the floodgates of pre-release information will open a little wider, as we get closer to the film's April 3, 2026, premiere date.</p>

			<p>Bethesda's next major internal project for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fallout series</strong> is reportedly the long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster, a title that has been a sort of open secret since internal documents leaked in 2023.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ magazine</a>, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard, Bethesda's Director and Executive Producer, discussed the need for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"creative reset"</em>&nbsp;in the</span> The Elder Scrolls and </span>Fallout series. While the next entry in The Elder Scrolls series was formally announced years ago (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">though it is still a long way off</a>), the next Fallout game has yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>Still, the franchise is very much alive. <em>"Hundreds"</em> of people at Bethesda are working on Fallout right now, and some of them are working on "some other things", according to Todd Howard.<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/"> As reported by VGC</a>, one of these other things is a Fallout 3 remaster, similar to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remastered-a-project-long-in-the-works">Fallout 3 Remastered: A Project Long in the Works</h2>



<p>Although a Fallout 3 remaster has never been officially announced, we have known for quite some time that it is in development. In September 2023, files attached to an FTC investigational hearing held remotely with Phil Spencer were leaked online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/"> revealing Bethesda's internal plans from 2020 to 2024</a>. Among the projects listed for a tentative release from April 2024 to March 2025 was a remaster of Fallout 3. </p>



<p>As this scheduled predated the COVID-19 pandemic, plans significantly shifted, and most of the projects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> released later than originall intended, so it's no surprise that even the remaster of the third entry in the post-apcalpytic series has yet to be released.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-coat-of-paint">A New Coat of Paint</h2>



<p>As the Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly similar to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it will likely utilize the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the original engine for gameplay, a trend that has become increasingly common in both remasters and remakes such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-campaign-evolved-comparison-massive-visual-improvements/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. If this is indeed the case, the gameplay of the remaster will be virtually left untouched, which should make those looking for an authentic recreation of the now-classic role-playing game happy.</p>

			<p>Enshrouded, the popular survival game currently available on PC in early access, has just received its biggest update yet ahead of its 1.0 release due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026. It's latest Wake of the Water update is available now, and adds highly requested features like voxel-based, dynamic water, a new biome, balance tweaks to combat, and more.</p>



<p>Developer and publisher Keen Games debuted two new trailers alongside today's update, one that's more of a cinematic showcase for the new Wake of the Water update, and another that goes into more detail about what's coming in this new update.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features Wake of the Water adds is a whole new water biome with full underwater exploration and dynamic voxel water, which has been one of the most-requested features from players that Keen Games is finally making good on.</p>



<p>The new update also adds new bosses and enemies for players to face, an overhaul to combat with balance tweaks, the introduction of greatswords, new weapon skills, and armor sets. The new update also adds fishing as an activity for players to catch food and adds a new layer to the survival mechanics in Enshrouded, and several more quality-of-life improvements.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Wake of the Water is Enshrouded's seventh major update during the game's early access period and is the latest showcase for just how much the game has changed and evolved since its initial early access launch in January 2024.</p>



<p>In its initial four days in early access, Enshrouded <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/">was able to reach one million players</a>.  It reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">three million players by August 2024</a>, and in April 2025, i<a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">t celebrated over four million players</a>. The growth Enshrouded has had since its launch is incredibly impressive, and it'll be interesting to see if it can continue the momentum it has seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/">early access through to its 1.0 launch next year</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls VI Is Still A Long Way Off, Says Todd Howard, Who Preaches Patience But Would Love the Game to ‘Just Appear’ Eventually]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite <span>being largely an interview about Fallout 4 (the </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Anniversary Editio</span>n</a>, which celebrates the game's tenth birthday, launches today), the article published today&nbsp;on GQ,&nbsp;featuring a conversation with Todd Howard, actually begins with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>



<p>The game designer obviously knew that questions about the most anticipated game in Bethesda's pipeline would abound and prefaces the whole interview with the notion that the next iteration in The Elder Scrolls franchise is 'still a long way off', before adding that he's preaching patience to fans. Howard then admits that it's been too long since Skyrim, which launched in November 2011, but adds that the team as a whole needed a 'creative reset', which they tried to accomplish with Starfield and its different setting.</p>



<p>Later in the interview, after talking a bit about Fallout and the upcoming second season of the Amazon Prime Video TV series, Howard returns to TES VI. Apparently, there was a large playtest session just yesterday at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<p><em>We did a big play test yesterday for The Elder Scrolls VI, and you have to really look at the screen and say, “What is this? What does this need? Where are we at?” Great games are played, not made. The screen doesn’t lie.</em></p>



<p>Apparently, the team showed The Elder Scrolls VI to some fans who pulled funds via Make-A-Wish to commemorate a friend of theirs in the upcoming game. It's not the first time Bethesda has done something like this: they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game to some folks from the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>, who left excited about the upcoming title.</p>



<p>In the GQ interview, Howard then says his perfect way to release the massively anticipated roleplaying game would be that, after 'a while', the game 'just appears'. He doesn't guarantee it will go this way, but when asked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-drop of Oblivion Remastered</a>, the developer remarks:</p>



<p><em>You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, though, I doubt that will be the case. Microsoft will likely want to give the game, which was formally announced at E3 2018 alongside Starfield, at least some lead time. More likely is a scenario akin to Fallout 4, where Howard unveiled the game at E3 2015 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> five months later on November 10, 2015. That would still be a relatively short lead time for a triple-A game of this hype.</p>



<p>Our best estimate at this point puts the game in a tentative late 2027 launch window at the earliest, although the first half of 2028 is even more likely. It wouldn't be the first time for an Elder Scrolls launch, either, as Oblivion was released in March 2006. Meanwhile, we'll report on any noteworthy The Elder Scrolls VI rumors.</p>
