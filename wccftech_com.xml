			<p>At CES 2025, video game accessories manufacturer Genki surprised everyone by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-full-unit-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing off a mock-up replica of the Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> well ahead of the official announcement. It didn't take long for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously litigious company</a> to explore legal steps, which have now been officially filed in the United States, in the Central District of California. You can read the whole filing <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but these are some of the accusations levied by Nintendo:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Genki’s claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorized, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>Additionally or alternatively, Genki in fact illegally and/or illicitly gained access to a pre-release model of the Nintendo Switch 2, rendering its statements otherwise objectively false.</em></li>
<li><em>Defendant’s infringing use of Nintendo’s trademarks in its advertising is in direct competition with Nintendo’s and its licensee’s legitimate marketing of Nintendo’s new console and authorized accessories. </em></li>
<li><em>Nintendo has not authorized Defendant to use its marks, including the NINTENDO SWITCH Marks, in connection with Defendant’s business or products. </em></li>
<li><em>Defendant had prior knowledge of Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks before using those marks in connection with its marketing and accessories.</em></li>
<li><em>Defendant intentionally reproduced Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks on its fabricated mock-up of Nintendo’s next-generation console in order to simulate Plaintiff’s well-known brand and exploit and appropriate for itself the public goodwill associated with Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Genki, which is currently <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/collections/ns2-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking pre-orders for its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories</a>, publicly shared the following response <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via X</a>:</p>
<p><em>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</em></p>
<p><em>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</em></p>
<p><em>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week. </em><em>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch in exactly one month. You can read everything we know about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our roundup article</a>.</p>

			<p>The first Oblivion Remastered 4K texture pack is now available for download, introducing high-quality upscaled textures that significantly improve the vanilla ones.</p>
<p>The Unchained Texture packs, which have been created by Canarious and are available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2189?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, are part of a work-in-progress project that aims to feature every texture in the game upscaled to at least 4K with a base resolution of 1024 and lower. The current version of the project features AI-upscaled textures for equipment items such as weapons, armor, and clothing, and should be followed by upscaled textures for landscapes, vegetation, and buildings. You can check some of these upscaled textures before downloading in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Like many other titles, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered features some low-resolution textures, but they in no way diminish the excellent job Virtuos did in updating the classic game's visuals, bringing them to new heights. You can learn more about how the remaster manages to update the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda while remaining extremely faithful to the original in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda’s classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way.</em></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Kingdom Come Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two important sales milestones for the franchise. To begin with, the sequel that launched around three months ago has sold over three million units to date. It had previously become <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a million seller in just a single day</a>, while the two million milestone <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached after two weeks</a>. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is definitely selling a lot faster than its predecessor, which only reached three million sales over two years after its debut.</p>
<p>It's not too surprising, anyway, given that it had established a strong fanbase with the original and it received excellent reviews, including a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> by Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Lots of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still on the way, too, with three premium DLCs coming in Summer, Fall, and Winter.</p>
<p>But the original game is also still selling reasonably well. Last we heard, it had reached 8 million units sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just six months ago</a>, and it has now broken through the 10 million sales milestone. Of course, it's heavily discounted at this point, but it's still an impressive figure for a game that began as an indie title funded on Kickstarter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney discussed Unreal Engine 6 for the first time (alongside several other topics) in a massive interview featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Lex Friedman podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney said that the next big iteration of the Unreal Engine technology will unify the parallel development threads that Epic is currently working on. The goal is to get the first UE6 previews out to developers in two to three years.</p>
<p><em>We have these two different tendrils of progress. There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers, and there's Unreal Engine 5 targeting the Fortnite community. And there's different bits of development that are only in one area that aren't applied to both. Not all the Unreal Engine 5 features are actually available in Fortnite, because some of them we haven't figured out or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them to all seven platforms in a platform-independent way. </em></p>
<p><em>The place where all of these different threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.&nbsp; </em><em>And it's a few years away. We don't have an exact timeframe, but we could be seeing preview versions of it perhaps two to three years from now. We're making continuous progress towards it.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Epic president admits that the technology is currently being hindered by the company's decision to stick with single-threaded simulations. That choice was made to simplify things not only for Epic itself but also for all game developers, but it is a limitation that Sweeney plans to overcome with Unreal Engine 6, which should finally fully embrace multithreading.</p>
<p><em>The biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation on Unreal Engine. We run a single-threaded simulation. If you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running the rest of the complicated game logic because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming, and we didn't want to</em><br>
<em>burden either ourselves, our partners, or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</em></p>
<p><em>Over time, that becomes an increasing limitation, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and that being Unreal Engine 6, that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine and get those on a better foundation that the modern world deserves, given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that timeframe.</em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the source of most, if not all, the CPU-related issues we've seen with Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It's great to hear Epic is finally going to address it, though it'll be a long while before we see Unreal Engine 6 in any game. As a reminder, the first UE5 preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-preview-updated-to-allow-for-even-bigger-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in early 2022</a>, while the first games that took advantage of the new technology didn't appear on the market until mid-to-late 2023: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layers of Fear remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a>, to name a few. As such, we might have to wait until late 2028/2029 to play the initial batch of Unreal Engine 6 games.</p>
