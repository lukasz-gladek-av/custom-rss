			<p>During the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RGG Summit 2025 livestream</a> that just ended, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced a new game called Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, confirming last week's leak that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-by-rgg-studio-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed exactly to this type of news</a>.</p>



<p>The developer describes Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties as an 'extreme' remake of the 2009 action/adventure game, promising to overhaul every aspect of the classic title. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio says that the bustling streets of Okinawa and Tokyo will be brought to life in stunning detail, and the reimagined combat elevates the brutal brawling action to new heights. Added scenes deliver more depth and emotion to the beloved story, and new and enhanced side experiences immerse players in the world like never before.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 also includes a brand-new side game called Dark Ties, centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, it is a prequel where Mine plunges into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is already available to pre-order across all platforms (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2) ahead of the scheduled launch of February 11, 2026. </p>



<p>The Standard Edition is priced $59.99, while a Deluxe Edition is available for $74.99. All pre-orders are getting the Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga bonus, which adds Ichiban Kasuga (the new protagonist in the most recent Yakuza games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang. The Deluxe Edition also includes the Legendary Character Outfit pack, the Legendary Lads &amp; Gals Pack, the Customization Pack, the Flip Phone Customization Pack, and the Legendary BGM CD Pack.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developer also announced Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, an enhanced version of the 2015 game (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-0-scheduled-january-24-2017-americas-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually launched in January 2017 in Western countries</a>) featuring dual audio with a new English voice track, new cutscenes to expand the narrative, and a Red Light Raid online co-op multiplayer mode that will be released at a later date. Save data from Yakuza 0 is incompatible with the Director's Cut, and there is no option to upgrade for existing owners, who would have to repurchase the game. Yakuza 0 Director's Cut will be released on December 8 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>On the same day (December 8, 2025), Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will launch Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. A Yakuza Series 20th Anniversary Bundle that includes Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 will also be available for PC and PlayStation 5, though only as a physical edition. </p>

			<p>When Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 would be launching on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">October 3, 2025</a>, before delivering the news, he started to act as if he was about to deliver bad news, that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game wasn't going to make it out before the end of 2025. He then happily and excitedly announced that it would be arriving on October 3.</p>



<p>Well, so much for that. This evening, Gearbox took to the <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">official Borderlands X (formerly Twitter) account</a> to announce that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 has been delayed. It will no longer be released on October 3. In fact, we don't know when it will be released, because Gearbox didn't provide a new release date or release window, and we'll just have to wait for an update when Gearbox has "<em>fully adjusted</em>" its plans.</p>



<p>On top of that, in line with Nintendo's eShop policy, all digital pre-orders of the game are being cancelled, so you'll have to pre-order it again whenever a new date is announced. You can go ahead and cancel your pre-order yourself, or it will happen automatically this Friday, September 26, 2025. If you have a physical pre-order, you'll have to deal with the retailer you got it from to figure out your next steps there.</p>



<p>"<em>Greetings, Vault Hunters,</em>" the studio began in its statement. "<em>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we've fully adjusted our plans</em>."</p>

<p>It's unfortunate news for Borderlands fans who were hoping to play Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, if it had kept its original release date, but it's not exactly surprising considering the myriad of technical issues the game has faced on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it makes it out before the end of this year, which would make Pitchford's joke from his video in July still applicable. Though between all the fixes Gearbox is trying to implement on the versions of the game that's already out in players' hands, it can't help but feel unlikely that the Switch 2 version will be pushed to the back of the priority line, and we won't see it arrive until 2026.</p>
