			<p>Chipmaker AMD revealed in their <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-beat-intel-earned-13-5-more-data-center-ai-revenue-in-q4/">Q4 Earnings Call</a> that this console generation has been incredibly strong, with the company's cumulative unit shipments surpassing $100 million during the fourth quarter. Those units are semi-custom processors that are used to power a vast majority of the gaming consoles that exist right now. This includes chips for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and even the Steam Deck. Although this is a huge milestone for AMD, it was unfortunately overshadowed by their revenue totals in the <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnings Call</a>.</p>
<p>It was said that AMD gaming revenue was down by 59% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. AMD's gaming segment made $563 million in the three-month period ending December 2024. When comparing it to the year before, it was a pretty massive drop. The company made $1.4 billion in gaming revenue in the same period in 2024. However, revenue as a whole for AMD was a record $7.7 billion, growing 24% year over year, with the growth coming from the Data Center and Client segments.</p>
<p>However, it's said that annual revenue in the Data Center segment nearly doubled, and Client Segment revenue grew by 52%, which helped offset the declines from the Gaming segments.&nbsp; CEO Lisa Su said that she expects gaming revenue to continue to be down from the previous quarter but not as significant a decline as other parts of the business. Looking into the future, Lisa says that channel inventories have normalized, with semi-custom sales returning to historical patterns.</p>
<p>The Earnings Call also mentioned the plans for the next year in the AMD gaming segment. Lisa Su goes on to say, "Our focus with this generation is to address the highest volume portion of the enthusiast gaming market with our new RDNA 4 architecture. <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/">RDNA 4</a> delivers significantly better ray tracing performance and adds support for AI-powered upscaling technology that will bring high-quality 4K gaming to mainstream players."</p>
<p>It's expected that there will be "modest increases" in the Gaming and Embedded businesses. For the 2025 financial reports, AMD plans to combine the client and the gaming segment into a single segment. It's also been said that revenue is expected to be approximately "$7.1 billion plus or minus $300 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and the client business."</p>
<p>While AMD had a successful fourth quarter of 2024, it has been mentioned multiple times that revenue is expected to decline in the gaming segment, which other areas of the company will offset. However, with the rise of handheld gaming PCs, AMD may end up in a better position than it once thought. Especially with the potential of a new Steam console being released, which will most likely utilize AMD.</p>

			<p>The last layoffs from Hi-Rez Studios came in late 2024, and now they have seemingly conducted layoffs again this week. At the time of writing, approximately 30 employees have revealed that they were impacted by these layoffs across social media. Their announcements have been compiled into a single <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit megathread</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been disclosed.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7293312305092599809/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lucky suggests</a></span> that the cuts to the team are "massive," with most of the layoffs impacting the Smite team, with a team currently working on Smite 2, which is in Open Beta.</p>
<p>The previous layoffs at Hi-Rez came in <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">October 2024</a>, with the impacted staff working on cosmetic and system features on the original Smite. However, this new round of layoffs seems to have impacted a wide variety of roles across the company. This includes producers, designers, programmers, and even Esports commentators.</p>
<p>It's uncertain whether Hi-Rez will make a comment about these layoffs or whether they are trying to keep them on the down low. However, when the layoffs in October took place, CEO Stewart Chisam took to social media to explain the reasoning behind the layoffs, saying that it was to ensure the longevity of Smite 2, with hopes that the game would "last into the 2030s."</p>
<p>However, since those layoffs, Chisam's X account has been deleted, which is where he originally made his announcement regarding the layoffs. His announcement was also posted on LinkedIn. At present, there has been no sign of an announcement or explanation behind these layoffs.</p>
<p>The staff impacted have been releasing their statements regarding their time at Hi-Rez Studios and also going on to express their frustration regarding the layoffs. Some stated that they knew that it was coming, even though they felt it shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>It's likely that this is part of a strategy shift, much like the layoffs that took place in October, to downsize the amount of staff that are currently working on the original Smite. Whether any of the staff members impacted will be given an opportunity to transfer to other departments within the company remains to be seen, alongside whether or not Hi-Rez Studios will be aiding the staff impacted.</p>
