			<p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have announced the Year 2 roadmap for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, which will include the addition of a new playable class, new game modes, new operations, and more.</p>



<p>A trailer debuted today goes over everything to expect for the second year of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 updates, that'll kick off next week on September 4, 2025, which is days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Space Marine 2's launch.</p>

<p>The new additions to gameplay, including the new modes, the new playable class, the Techmarine, and the new operations, additional weapons, enemies, and bosses, will all be added as part of free updates that will arrive throughout Saber's Year 2 plans for Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>There will also be a bevy of additional paid cosmetic content that will be delivered through the season pass for year 2, but of course cosmetics are always an optional bonus. You won't be missing out on any additional playable content if you skip out on the season pass. </p>

<p>This past June, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment celebrated Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/">surpassing 7 million copies sold</a> in the game's first year, and while it's clear from this roadmap that Saber is still hard at work on keeping Space Marine 2 updated, the studio has already confirmed that work has begun on<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/"> Space Marine 3</a>.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Wccftech reviewed Space Marine 2 last year</a>, we enjoyed it, even if the gameplay fell into a rut after some time with it. "<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em>"</p>

			<p>Even though the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over, you can still get the chance to play it again ahead of its launch on October 10, 2025. Alongside a new trailer for the PC version of Battlefield 6 that debuted today, EA and Battlefield Studios also resumed sign-ups for its Battlefield Labs playtesting program, where new maps, gameplay modes, and adjustments from the beta will be tested ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The trailer is a feature highlight reel of the experience PC players will be able to have, so long as they have the hardware for it, of course. With ultrawide monitor support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/">NVIDIA DLSS multi-frame generation support</a>, along with support for Intel XeSS and AMD FSR, and boasting 600+ customization options for PC. If you played the beta on your PC, then you're probably already aware of this. You're also probably aware of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">secure boot issue</a> that plagued many players just trying to get into Battlefield 6, which, in its own way, gets a mention in the trailer as it highlights the game's Javelin Anti-Cheat protection.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's more exciting is the fact that there's still a chance to play more Battlefield 6 before its launch, with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">Battlefield Labs sign-ups resuming again</a>. If you weren't already in the playtesting program, you're getting another shot, with the collective Battlefield Studios looking to test all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">changes previously discussed based on feedback from the beta</a>, along with new functionality for Battlefield Portal and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs playtesters will also get to try out new maps like Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, and be able to test out Hardcore Mode for the first time.</p>



<p>If you loved the beta and are dying to play more Battlefield 6, then the Labs playtesting program is your best bet to jump in as soon as you can. Beyond that, you'll have to wait until it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025, to jump back in the fight.</p>
