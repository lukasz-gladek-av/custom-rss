			<p>Half-Life 3 is a game that no fan of the series thought would ever see the light of day. Although the game hasn't been revealed yet, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"><strong>numerous indications over the past few months that Valve may be working on a new entry in the series</strong></a>. However, if the wait for an announcement is becoming unbearable, you can get a glimpse of the potential future of the series in a new look at the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/"><strong>Half-Life 2 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A new look at one of the most impressive modding projects, powered by NVIDIA's modding tool, was provided a few days ago by a new comparison video from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">MxBench</strong><strong>m</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">arkPC</strong></a>. The video compares the vanilla release with the latest version of the project, which incorporates significant improvements over its initial launch.</p>



<p>Although the performance hit on an RTX 5080 GPU is considerable, the new PBR assets, GPU and CPU performance improvements, lighting enhancements, improved volumetric fog and water, and the new tonemapper which prevents image from being too bright make this mod worth a try for fans of the series who want to experience the game like never before.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 3 is no longer a fever dream of fans of the series, but a concrete possibility. Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/">rumored 2025 announcement</a></strong> of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">project known as HLX</a></strong> may not materialize, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Valve is undoubtedly actively working on it</a></strong>, adding new features to the Source 2 engine over the past few months that will likely be incorporated into the game. Some of these will reportedly make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">Half-Life 3 a very immersive experience</a></strong> that should make the wait since the launch of Half-Life:Alyx well worth it.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, a massive wave of layoffs at Xbox affected several gaming projects, including announced titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/"><strong>a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online</strong></a>, and many others. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">The next unannounced project by Romero Games</a></strong>, the studio created by DOOM series creator John Romero, was also cancelled, but today, it has been confirmed that it has been saved, and though its scope has been changed, it will be an innovative experience in the vein of FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@htdreams"><strong>Andrés De Pedro Álvarez</strong></a>, speaking at the Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 last week, the creator of the DOOM series confirmed that the unannounced project has been saved. However, the game has been redesigned and has become something different despite incorporating many elements from the title canceled earlier this year.</p>



<p>Though the DOOM series creator couldn't get into specifics other than the fact that the game is much smaller than before, he did say that he has never played a game like this shooter before. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience,"</em> Romero said. </p>



<p>Comparing the game to a masterpiece like FromSoftware's is definitely bold, but also very exciting, especially coming from the developer that contributed to the creation of the genre with Wolfenstein 3D and its establishment with the DOOM and Quake series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The confirmation that the next project from Romero Games has been saved is rather welcome, but not entirely surprising. Following the cancellation of the game that Xbox would have published, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/"><strong>the studio had not closed and was evaluating opportunities from other publishers</strong></a>. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the first glimpses of a game that already sounds very interesting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a week, the second season of the Fallout show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will air on Amazon Prime Video</a>, and the main cast is currently busy with a series of interviews. Walton Goggins, the renowned actor behind what's arguably the most iconic character in the TV series, The Ghoul (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added to Fallout 76 as a quest-giving NPC</a>, voiced by Goggins), recently appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVH3ASR4cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Virgin Radio UK's 'Chris Evans Breakfast Show'</a> to reveal that creator Jonathan Nolan, the producers, the cast and the whole staff 'went for broke' instead of playing it safe with this second season.</p>



<p><em>I've been in this situation a few times where, if over the course of the first chapter of a show, if you will, if you're able to build a critical mass, what you have an opportunity to do in season two or chapter 2, is play it safe or go for broke and put everything in there. And that's what we did. We, meaning like, us in front of the camera, but really everybody behind the camera. There are 700 people employed by the Fallout show. It is a world.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, the actor showered Jonathan Nolan with praise for the scene in the first season's pilot when the bombs start dropping and his character, Cooper Howard, runs with his daughter for their lives.</p>



<p><em>It's based on one of the biggest video games in the world, right? Fallout. This game has been played for 20-some years by players all over the world, and there's a very unique attachment to this experience. When we set out to do this, Jonathan Nolan in cahoots with Todd Howard and Bethesda Games, the idea was to tell an original story within the canon of Fallout. So yeah, it picks up in the very first episode with the ending of the world really seen through my perspective. I didn't understand what a unique opportunity that was for me until I saw it on film. Even though I experienced it, you know, on the day, but seeing it, I didn't realize that it was going to affect me viscerally the way that it did. [...] The way that John Nolan architected those shots and the way that he chose to tell that story was terrifying.</em></p>



<p>The second season of the Fallout show will run for eight episodes, just like the first one. A new episode will be released each week, with the second one scheduled for Christmas Eve, the third for New Year's Eve, and the final one for February 4, 2026. The story picks up immediately in the aftermath of the previous season's finale, taking viewers on a journey through the Mojave wasteland to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without retconning the events seen in the game Fallout: New Vegas</a>). Deathclaws have been confirmed to appear this season, too.</p>



<p>New additions to the cast of the Fallout show include Macaulay Culkin, who plays a mysterious "crazy genius" character; Justin Theroux, who portrays Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas; Kumail Nanjiani, who stars as a high-ranking officer of the Brotherhood of Steel; and Amy Acker, who will play Cooper Howard's assistant during the flashbacks. The show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already confirmed for a third season, too</a>.</p>

			<p>Among the technical solutions Sony implemented in its PlayStation 5 to enable the system to reach maximum performance without issue is a liquid metal cooling solution, which helps keep temperatures down when the system is pushed to its limits.</p>



<p>This cooling solution, however, led to significant issues, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/">the liquid metal can leak and leave dry spots on critical components, resulting in various malfunctions.</a></strong> Although Sony made some changes for the PlayStation 5 Pro and some of the latest base console models, liquid metal cooling issues can still affect systems, potentially even all of them, according to a technician.</p>



<p>Over on X,<a href="https://x.com/Modyfikator89"><strong> modder and service technician modyfikatorcasper</strong></a> shared a new report on a PlayStation 5 Slim (CFI-2016) system with less than one and a half years of life, which has been impacted by liquid metal issues. In this case, however, the liquid metal leak wasn't caused by the system's position, but by application quality and degradation over time and temperature. As such, the service technician believes all PS5 systems will eventually require maintenance, regardless of the model and its position.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>While the claim that all PlayStation 5 models will eventually require maintenance is bold, it is undeniable that the liquid metal issues have affected a lot of systems. Earlier this year, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassels highlighted how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">these issues are becoming more widespread</a></strong>, with an increasing number of users reporting various malfunctions over the past few months.</p>



<p><span>As most <span>current reports of PlayStation 5 units malfunctioning due to liquid metal issues involve older systems, it will take some time to determine if the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-consoles-improved-liquid-metal-application-similar-to-ps5-pro-prevent-leak-better-cooling/" target="_blank"><strong>new liquid metal TIM layout</strong></a>&nbsp;of the newly released&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank"><strong>CFI-2100 model</strong></a>&nbsp;has been accompanied by improved</span> application to prevent degradation over time, as it should with leaking issues.</span></p>
