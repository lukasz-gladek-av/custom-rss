			<p>Like its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II doesn't really want to make things easy for the player, featuring some unique gameplay systems that require full understanding to take advantage of them and some other systems that may feel a little dated, such as a saving system that requires you to use a specific item, Savior Schnapps potions, to save the game at any time while away from Henry's bed. As the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios is all about making choices and living with their consequences, such a saving system makes quite a bit of sense to prevent any sort of save scumming.</p>
<p>For some players, however, having to use items to access a very basic functionality like saving the game anywhere is a big no. Thankfully, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II features some workarounds to this issue that are accessible on both PC and consoles and are, overall, rather convenient.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207125020_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Things are obviously easier on PC, as there's a mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlimited Saving II</a> that allows you to save anytime without using Savior Schnapps potions. Better yet, using this mod doesn't disable Achievements if you're into collecting them, so there's really no reason not to use this mod if you don't like the vanilla game's saving system.</p>
<p>On consoles, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II makes it a little harder to cheat the saving system, but not by much. As you probably already know, the game's main menu features a Save and Quit option that allows you to quit the game at any time without losing progress. This option can easily be abused to actually save at any time, as the game doesn't delete your save file as it gets loaded. The only downside to this is that you will have to go through the loading screen again, but this isn't a major problem on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles, as load times are very fast, and you will only have to wait a few seconds before diving back in. Using this saving method is extremely good for beginners who never played the original game, as it allows them to experiment with the game's many somewhat obscure mechanics without risking losing tons of progress due to the vanilla's hardcore saving system.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-new-joy-con-and-pro-controller-patent-heavily-suggest-mouse-functionality-for-the-controller.1102992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-patent-mouse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored mouse functionality for the new Nintendo Switch 2-Con controller is most likely real, judging from a recently filed patent that surfaced online.</p>
<p><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new patent</a>, which was published only yesterday, February 6th, provides an overview of the Joy-Con and Pro controllers and includes some drawings that better outline their functionality. What makes the patent very interesting are these drawings, as they show how the Joy-Con controllers could be used as a regular PC mouse with a left Joy-Con used as a regular controller and the right one as a PC mouse, an arrangement clearly intended for first-person shooters, or even in a dual-mouse configuration that could be used for a huge variety of games. Interestingly enough, even the Pro controller seems to feature mouse functionality with two detachable halves that would act as Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers having mouse functionality has been suggested not only by Nintendo itself in the system's reveal trailer but by some developers as well. Civilization VII executive producer Dennis Shirk recently said that Nintendo is doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cant-come-soon-enough-cool-joy-con/">something very cool with the controller</a>&nbsp;and that it would be equally cool if it could be used as a PC mouse. This functionality would be a big boon for strategy games, allowing developers to implement PC controls in a console game without requiring any additional accessory or controller.</p>
<p>It may be a while longer before we learn if the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con and Pro controllers will feature mouse functionality. The console's next look will be coming on April 2nd with a dedicated <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">Nintendo Direct</a>, which will definitely shed more light on how the console will be different from the original model, besides having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better specs</a> that will make it easier for developers to port games from PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is still scheduled for release this Fall, the game's publisher Take-Two Interactive recently confirmed.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206999431/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Rockstar Games' parent company stated that this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, thanks to the release of games such as Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall and Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>Besides reiterating that Grand Theft Auto VI is still releasing this Fall, in its latest financial reports, Take-Two Interactive also confirmed the number of copies sold for some of its franchises and games. The Grand Theft Auto series as a whole sold over 440 million units, and almost half of these sales are thanks to Grand Theft Auto V, which has sold, to date, a whopping 210 million units. The Red Dead Redemption series, on the other hand, has sold over 95 million units, and the vast majority of these sales are thanks to Red Dead Redemption 2, which sold over 70 million units worldwide and has been the second best-selling title in the United States based on both unit and dollar sales. The NBA 2K franchise also continues to do quite well, having sold over 155 million units worldwide and being one of the top contributors to Take-Two's recurrent consumer spending.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future, Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick also confirmed, as reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/take-two-talks-nintendo-switch-2-indicates-it-will-support-the-console/">Nintendo Everything</a>, that the publisher fully expects to support the Nintendo Switch 2. Take-Two has had a longstanding relationship with Nintendo and has supported the platform when it made sense. Nowadays, Nintendo's consoles can support any audience, according to Zelnick, suggesting that the publisher could support the next console with more diverse titles not strictly aimed at a younger audience.</p>
<p>While a delay is always possible, it is definitely good to hear that Grand Theft Auto VI will launch as scheduled in a few months on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A lot seems to be riding on its successful release, as it is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, </a>so no matter when it is launching, it will almost certainly be a smashing success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pubg-blindspot-is-a-new-5v5-top-down-tactical-shooter-demo-available-during-february-steam-next-fest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, KRAFTON unveiled a new game called PUBG: Blindspot. Previously known as Project Arc, this is a 5v5 team based top-down tactical shooter that reportedly features fast paced shooting inspired by PUBG.</p>
<p>PUBG: BLINDSPOT presents a real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, creating instant, non-verbal cooperation and allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against real players.</p>
<p>In PUBG: BLINDSPOT's take on bomb missions, the attacking players will be tasked to hack into the building's hidden Crypt by installing a Decrypter. They may use grenade launchers and explosive hammers to breach walls and defenses to reach the Crypt or ambush the enemy. Defenders will instead try preventing the enemy from reaching the Crypt. They can install the Decrypter by blocking doors and setting up barricades to prevent access.</p>
<p>Weapons available in the game include assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, long-range weapons like sniper rifles and DMR, pistols, grenade launchers and more, each with their own unique characteristics and feel.</p>
<p>The characters available in PUBG: BLINDSPOT each have their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets. You will see familiar weapons such as the Mk14, AWM and P90, as well as a variety of unique gadgets such as Blue Zone Grenades, Reconnaissance Drones, Grenade Launchers and Close Quarters Explosives. And, of course, throwable staples such as flash bangs and smoke grenades make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446700/PUBG_BLINDSPOT_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable demo</a> will be available for download starting on February 21 as part of Steam Next Fest. The demo features ten unique characters with their own signature weapons and special tools, three intense team deathmatch maps, and four demolition mission maps featuring their own themes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following two <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-further-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delays</a>, Sports Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887773293232668799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the cancellation of Football Manager 25 after 'extensive discussion with SEGA'. The development team said it will focus on developing the next installment in the football coach simulation franchise.</p>
<p><em>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of Football Manager 25, we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em>We could have pressed on, released Football Manager 25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</em></p>
<p>This cancellation affects all versions of the game, in case you were wondering. Automatic refunds will be issued to those who had pre-ordered the game. Furthermore, Football Manager 24 will not be updated with season 2024/25 data, as Sports Interactive said this would be a large effort that ultimately takes resources away from making the next installment.</p>
<p>A release window for Football Manager 2026 hasn't been shared yet, but the franchise has traditionally launched between November and December.</p>
