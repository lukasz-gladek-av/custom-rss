			<p><span>Yesterday, during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FrLCDS3hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase, </a>which was held in partnership with IGN, Microsoft unveiled several news tidbits from third-party developers.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, the most important was the announcement of the release date for Revenge of the Savage Planet. This is the sequel to Journey to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, which earned a positive reception, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Anybody pining for more Metroid Prime needs to put Journey to the Savage Planet at the top of their list. The game has a few rough edges and its sense of humor might not be to all tastes, but it captures that inviting, adventuresome Metroid spirit better than anything Iâ€™ve played in a while. This Savage Planet will pull you into its orbit if you give it half a chanc</em>e.</p>
<p>However, getting a sequel going wasn't easy at all for the developers. Typhoon Studios was acquired by Google shortly prior to the game's release, but in early 2021, following Google's divestiture from its Stadia initiative, the studio was shut down alongside others. Later that year, former members of Typhoon, including Game Director and Writer Alex Hutchinson, established a new developer called Raccoon Logic and were able to secure the rights from Google to produce a sequel. Revenge of the Savage Planet launches on May 8 for Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and will be included with Game Pass on day one.</p>

<p>Another big news story from the ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase was the new trailer for Lies of P: Overture, the highly anticipated DLC for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Soulslike game</a>. In this expansion, players encounter a mysterious artifact that transports them back to Krat in its final days of grandeur. In the shadow of an impending tragedy, their mission is to explore the past and uncover its dark secrets, haunted by surprises, loss, and vengeance. The developer says the choices made will ripple through the past and present in the world of Lies of P, revealing hidden truths and leaving lasting consequences. Lies of P: Overture <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch this Summer</a>.</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>
