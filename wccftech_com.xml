			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/No-Mans-Land-Screeshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>

			<p>Though Black Friday deals usually start ahead of the actual date, there are always still deals that only appear on the day itself, which is why it's still worth keeping your eye out for deals and waiting for the actual day. Well, anyone who was patient enough to wait for it to actually be Black Friday in order to take advantage of deals on video games has been rewarded, because there's a slew of games, all of which were released in 2025, that you can grab for $40 or less on Amazon.</p>



<p>Of course, you can find older games for cheap as well, and some other 2025 releases on sale for more than $40, but no one is able to grab everything they want in a given year right at launch, so there's likely a few games in this list of 20 titles released in 2025 that you can pick up for cheap now.</p>

<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips">LinusTechTips</a> has built a gaming PC featuring specs similar to Valve's upcoming system, providing a good preview of the performance the system is expected to offer (which is speculated to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">heavily rely on AMD FSR to deliver 4K resolution at 60 FPS gameplay</a>). Building this system with off-the-shelf parts (some of which offered nice-to-have features that didn't significantly impact performance), purchased at their lowest historical price, resulted in a total cost of $602.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if this system were to be built today under current market conditions, which are severely impacted by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/memory-markets-have-entered-a-panic-buying-phase/"> memory shortages</a> that are already forcing companies such as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpowerpc-announces-price-changes-for-its-gaming-pcs-due-to-higher-ram-and-ssd-prices/">CyberPowerPC to increase the prices of their gaming PC</a>s, the cost would rise to $900. Going for cheaper parts that would keep the system's performance as is, the cost would be $813.</p>



<p>However, since Valve benefits from a direct-to-consumer model that lets them retain both brand and retailer margins, the total cost of the system (unlikely to be below $600–$650) will ultimately be decided by the markup Valve targets</p>



<p>If market conditions don't change further, Linus estimates that the system may cost $699.99, as this price is above the company's current cost. As the Steam Machine will be on sale for years, there will be plenty of opportunities for the company to improve its margins.</p>

<p>Although Linus' estimate sounds reasonable, based on the analysis, it's challenging to predict the Steam Machine's price accurately at this point. Valve has yet to confirm it, but has already stated that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">it will be really competitive, and in line with the cost of building a PC with similar specs</a>, and that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">the system won't be subsidized</a>, meaning that the company is not going to sell it at a loss at launch - something other console makers like Sony and Microsoft have done in the past thanks to the 30% cut on games sales from their own digital stores, a cut Valve also takes from every game sold on Steam.</p>
