			<p>Just last week, Konami announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/">Silent Hill f</a> would arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, on September 25, 2025, and today, during the company's Press Start presentation, we got our latest developed deep-dive from Konami, and a Japanese studio it collaborated with on Silent Hill f, Neobards.</p>
<p>Members from both Konami and Neobards talked about how the teams worked together to evolve the design of Silent Hill f to both keep the essence of a Silent Hill game, while leaning into the fact that the game is not set in the western town of Silent Hill, but in Japan, and is going for a Japanese style of horror story than anything else in the series so far.</p>
<p>"<em>The setting of Silent Hill f has shifted from the town of Silent Hill to Japan,</em>" said Silent Hill series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamoto. "<em>But it remains a psychological horror experience where one confronts themselves within a mental world. Taking into account that it is a psychological horror, we sought to enhance the essence of Japanese-style horror. The hallmark of Japanese horror is not simply grotesqueness, but the coexistence of beauty and the disturbing. We are creating this title with the concept: Find the beauty in terror</em>."</p>

<p>Neobards game director, Al Yang, added, "<em>We created our visual designs to have a distinct uneasiness to them, but also have a horrific charm that would make it so you just couldn't stop staring. In this matter, we were extremely fortunate to be able to work with Kera-san to design our key character art, as their designs perfectly suited the ideal of 'Beauty in Terror'.</em>"</p>

<p>We also heard from the game's scriptwriter, Ryukishi07, who discussed how he connected elements of present-day Japan with how different Japan was in the 1960s, which isn't exactly that long ago but is still very different compared to modern-day Japan.</p>
<p>With Silent Hill f's launch still months away, we'll likely hear and see more about the game before its release, but even now it feels safe to say that this is shaping up to potentially be one of the most terrifying Silent Hill games yet.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f also wasn't the only Silent Hill game featured during Konami's presentation, as the company also announced that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDORsTHAQSs">Bloober Team</a> would be back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake the first Silent Hill game</a>.</p>

			<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP, the first canon entry in the series in a very long time, is launching on PC as well as on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>During today's Press Start showcase, Konami confirmed the next entry in the role-playing game series, which returned to the spotlight earlier this year with the launch of a remaster of the first two games released on PlayStation decades ago, is launching on Steam as well as on mobile platforms. Besides confirming the game's Steam release, Konami also shared a brand new trailer providing more information on the story set a few years before the events of the original Suikoden and only a few years after Suikoden V, the latest main entry in the series. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=978&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP was officially announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-revival-continues-with-new-canon-mobile-game-animated-series/">March</a> as a new mobile entry in the series. Besides sporting beautiful 2D graphics over 3D backgrounds inspired by the first entries in the series, the game will also see the return of plenty of fan-favorite characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa. While characters from all over the series will be available via a gacha system, Suikoden STAR LEAP will also feature 108 Stars of Destiny that can be recruited without engaging in gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Suikoden I &amp; II: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars is the latest entry in the series, and is now available on PC and consoles.
