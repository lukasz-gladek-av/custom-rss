			<p>Ninja Theory has announced that Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive on PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829"> video posted to the studio's official X account</a>, with studio head Dom Matthews delivering the good news. Matthews doesn't provide a specific release date, only saying that it will arrive sometime this summer, though he did reveal that there will be some new features added to the game with the PS5 release that will also be available on the Xbox and PC versions of the game the same day the PS5 version launches.</p>
<p>"<em>We're so happy to tell you, our fans, that Hellblade 2 will be coming to PlayStation 5 this summer,</em>" Matthews said. "<em>This version of the game will include some new features, which will also be coming to Xbox and PC at the same time as an update</em>."</p>

<p>Ninja Theory might be an Xbox Game Studios developer now, but as Matthews points out in the video, the studio has a rich history with PlayStation. The first Hellblade game launched on PlayStation 4 before coming to Xbox a little less than a year later, and PlayStation veterans will remember that Ninja Theory was the team behind the PlayStation 3 launch title, Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>"<em>We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation, going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword, and we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans, back to Senua's story,</em>" Matthews continued. "<em>And so the team have been working hard to optimize Hellblade 2 for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro to give you the very best experience we can, and we look forward to sharing more details with you soon.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll launch on PlayStation under a slightly new title, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced, and is already available to wishlist on PS5 consoles.</p>

			<p>Microsoft is blaming Apple for the delay of its Xbox mobile store launch. The report comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from The Verge</a>, which found out that the Windows and Xbox company filed an amicus brief supporting Epic Games' fight against Apple.</p>
<p>While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent ruling</a> cracked the door wide open for the Epic Games Store and for the Xbox mobile store on iOS, Microsoft is wary of Apple's inevitable appeal and, as such, has filed a detailed argument in favor of the current ruling.&nbsp;Here's an excerpt from the filing:</p>
<p><em>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices. Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility. Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.</em></p>
<p>The Xbox mobile store was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch in July 2024</a>. When we last heard about the topic in late November, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed Google</a> for trying to block it from launching on its Android ecosystem.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-game-director-leaves-obsidian-to-join-netflix.1194936/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-game-director-leaves-obsidian-to-join-netflix/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel has left Obsidian after over 11 years to join Netflix, specifically the Night School Studio responsible for the Oxenfree franchise. Patel herself provided the announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330425052565307393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>The news is rather unexpected, to be honest. Following the successful launch of Avowed, Patel <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> her interest in doing more in the same world now that the team had found its groove, so to speak:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any issues between Patel and Obsidian. It's possible she simply got a better job offer and decided to take it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Night School Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-lays-off-employees-at-oxenfree-maker-night-school-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered an unknown number of layoffs just three months ago</a>. Following the 2023 debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</a>, the Californian studio has just released the mobile life simulation game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Venice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thronglets</a>, based on the Black Mirror IP. However, given Patel's long-standing expertise in the RPG genre (she also worked on the two Pillars of Eternity games and The Outer Worlds), it seems likely that Night School Studio could be heading toward that kind of game for their next project.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent action roleplaying game</a> has just received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-announces-its-2025-roadmap-for-avowed-update-1-4-patch-notes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed roadmap of updates.</a> The Summer patch will add new NPC abilities and behaviors, new active and passive abilities, new Unique armor and weapons, cooking and crafting improvements, and custom map markers. The Fall update will introduce the highly requested Photo Mode and New Game Plus, a new weapon type, the ability for players to change their character's appearance while out in the world, new character presets in the creation tool, and more Godlike feature character presets.</p>
