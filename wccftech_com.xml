			<p>Judging from its current immense popularity, the gacha RPG genre isn’t going anywhere. If anything, it's going to become even bigger, as games like HoYoVerse's Genshin Impact have proven how there's a rather big audience for ambitious and immersive open-world RPGs powered by gacha mechanics. Back in 2021, Chinese studio Hotta Studio tried getting into the trend with Tower of Fantasy, which provided a competent open-world experience featuring a solid visual design and gameplay, but failed to become a worldwide phenomenon due to issues that inevitably impacted the good the game has to offer, such as a confusing user interface, average balancing which renders some characters useless after a certain point in the adventure and some technical issues. Still, Tower of Fantasy proved Hotta Studio already had what it takes to create a compelling open-world gacha RPG back in 2021, and the experience made developing the game is going to serve Neverness to Everness well, judging from the second closed beta test.</p>



<p>Doing away with the fantasy setting with sci-fi elements of Tower of Fantasy, Neverness to Everness is set in the futuristic metropolis of Hethereau, where the amnesiac main character finds themselves after a Level VII anomaly disaster strikes New Helios. Possessing special abilities that allow them to deal with the strange occurrences known as Anomalies, the main character agrees after spending time in prison for observation, to participate in Code Zero containment operations, joining the Anomaly Hunter team at Eibon Antique Shop. Just from this premise, it's clear how the game has been heavily inspired by the latest entries in the Persona series, as the episodic, almost short anime show narrative arc, nature of the story, the character interactions and the Anomalies being not too dissimilar from the Shadows are clearly based on the ATLUS series. Though the second closed beta test only features a small part of the story, the episodic format works great to develop the overarching story while providing some self-contained, anime-styled fun, although the comedic situations and banter between characters sometimes diminish the unique, almost horror, feel that the vast majority of investigations possess. Thankfully, this isn't a major issue, at least for now, as the characters, although a little bit on the tropey side, are charming and personable, thanks to great design and animation works, and a decent spread between male and female characters, which tends to be a little unbalanced towards the female side in a good portion of the most popular games around.</p>



<p>As a gacha RPG lives and dies by how charming characters are, Neverness to Everness already seems to have everything needed to become a success, but I expect the setting and the open-world mechanics to become the defining feature of the game. When the game was revealed, it was often described as anime Grand Theft Auto, and this definition is not too far from the truth, although the opportunities to be a criminal are limited compared to the Rockstar Games series. Still, the police will start looking for you if you start stealing cars left and right, and in the game's current state, don't expect to be able to get away from officers too easily, as they put up quite a fight. Aside from committing crimes, Hetherau offers a lot of different side activities already, which include purchasing and managing businesses, car races, Spacetime Projector missions, where players need to rewind recordings of incidents to pinpoint the exact moment an Anomaly has appeared, hunting hidden items, and so on. Considering this is only the beginning for the game, the open-world mechanics and activities show a lot of promise.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides spending a lot of time roaming around Hetherau, players will spend quite a bit of time fighting Anomalies in Neverness to Everness using a big cast of characters. In this regard, the game looks promising as well, with a functional yet simple combat system which incorporates elements from character action games like perfect dodges and parries without feeling overwhelming, although the system would benefit from some additional depth, as the moveset of many of the characters available in the closed beta featured some interesting fighting styles that could have incorporated more than a special skill, an Ultimate and a basic single-button combo string. The room to grow and expand the combat, however, is definitely there, so hopefully the developer will provide a slightly deeper experience down the line. Character customization also feels to have potential with the Arcs system, which grants passive skills to characters, and a unique "artifacts" system that has the player slotting Tetris-like pieces to further enhance a character.</p>



<p>As for every similar game, however, it's the fairness of the gacha mechanics that can make or break the experience, and in this regard Neverness to Everness definitely has what it takes to be successful, as unlocking characters and leveling them up to use them in current content without any trouble promises to be less painful than in other games. Sure, there are still rolls and multiple currencies to keep track of, but players are guaranteed to get an A-Class item within 10 rolls, and an S-Class character within 90. Better yet, if multiple S-Class characters are available as part of one of the virtual tabletop boards, which represent the traditional banners seen in similar games, the player can choose which character they want, which is a great option that will likely make Neverness to Everness an extremely player-friendly gacha.</p>



<p>Neverness to Everness might not revolutionize gacha RPGs, but it shows how much more engaging and polished these games are becoming. The urban open world has a lot of potential with satisfying traversal and varied side activities,, and the overall presentation feels closer to what you'd expect to find in full-priced title. While there's still work to be done regarding performance, balancing, and speed of traversal on foot. Neverness to Everness definitely has the chance to become one of the best gacha games of the past few years.</p>

						<h5>Donkey Kong Bananza</h5><p><span>July 17, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the franchise that started it all for Nintendo, Donkey Kong has never been as meticulously managed as, say, Mario or Zelda. For decades, DK was largely entrusted to teams outside Nintendo’s core Japanese development structure, with the likes of Rare, Retro Studios, and the occasional third party offering their own varying spins on the franchise. That said, between a major role in the recent Super Mario Bros. movie and new Universal Studios attractions, it seems clear Nintendo is interested in returning Donkey Kong to true top-tier franchise status. As part of this, Nintendo is rolling out <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a new Switch 2 3D platformer from the EPD Tokyo team behind the likes of Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>Does Donkey Kong Bananza see Nintendo’s ape swing to new heights? Or does this one go Donkey Wrong? Time to dig into DK’s latest…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems DK has become more of a go-getter since his last original platformer, as Donkey Kong Bananza opens with him leading a mining operation, as he uses his fists to dig up “Banandium Gems” (this game’s equivalent of Mario Odyssey’s Power Moons) and scads of sparkly “Banandium Gold.” Unfortunately, a villainous crew of apes, known as VoidCo, crashes a meteor into DK’s mine, sinking all its precious treasure (and DK himself) further underground.</p>



<p>DK initially teams up with a funny little creature named Odd Rock, although it’s soon revealed the stony sidekick is actually Pauline (that’s not a spoiler, as Nintendo has heavily promoted her in trailers and PR materials). In previous games, Pauline has played the role of Donkey Kong’s unfortunate kidnapping victim and, later, the stylish Mayor of New Donk City, but here, she’s a somewhat naïve 13-year old who dreams of becoming a singer. DK and Pauline soon learn that getting back to the surface actually requires them to go deeper, down to the “Banandium Root,” which is said to grant wishes. And so, a journey to the center of the planet, through many colorful and strange locales, begins.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was quite surprised, pleasantly so, by how much attention Donkey Kong Bananza paid to its characters and story. The new DK and Pauline models are bursting with skillfully-animated energy and the two make a charming pair, both in big cutscenes, and during more low-key moments. DK Bananza has a system of “getaways” where you can rest and recharge your heart meter, and each time you go down for a nap you get to overhear fun, sometimes poignant, snippets of conversation between Pauline and her simian companion (DK sticks to grunts, but Pauline is fully voice acted). Pauline even has a nice little character arc, starting out unsure of her singing abilities then gaining confidence as the game progresses.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And yes, while I’ll provide no spoilers here, if you’re perplexed about some of the mysteries Nintendo have presented, like, say, why Pauline is a precocious tween now, I can confirm some actual answers are offered. Nintendo has a history of simply shrugging at continuity, and while I’m sure there are things that still don’t fit, Bananza ties into other games, and the greater Donkey Kong lineage, in ways I think will satisfy, and perhaps surprise, fans. Donkey Kong Bananza is a fulsome celebration of the franchise’s long and storied history.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for how Donkey Kong Bananza plays, our hairy hero doesn’t just use his fists to smash baddies anymore, he can now use them to plow into the terrain with a large portion of most environments being destructible. DK can punch forward, downward, and up, as well as slam down from above after a jump. Additionally, he can grab chunks of rock and dirt to throw, swing, or use as a handy surfboard, and can clamber up pretty much any vertical surface. It's a versatile set of tools for traversing and shaping the world, which makes Donkey Kong Bananza almost feel like a mixture of Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, it may take some players a while to get used to the feel of DK Bananza’s minute-to-minute gameplay. Bananza’s actual platforming is rather rudimentary, particularly in the early stages of the game. DK only has a single, relatively limited jump, and many of Mario's more advanced tricks like wall jumping aren’t present here. Really, the game is often more of a <em>climber</em> than a traditional platformer, with much of the game’s traversal revolving around your near-unlimited ability to scale most surfaces (although you will encounter a few smooth or slick surfaces you can’t get up). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but again, it's something you may have to adapt to. This isn't just Mario with a gorilla skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another thing that sets DK Bananza apart are its destruction mechanics, which allow you to smash most of what you see (down to an underlying hard base layer underneath most stages) and yes, it’s quite satisfying. You can tunnel your way into hills and rock formations, creating your own tunnel systems or, alternatively, rip up pieces of soft dirt and stick them together to make new bridges and other structures. Of course, everywhere you dig is positively chock full of all manner of goodies, including Banandium Gems, Banandium Chips, collectible fossils, treasure chests, and lots and lots of gold.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Admittedly, sometimes this freedom to smash whatever you want can make the game feel a bit messy. Often I’d find myself digging into the ground when I just wanted to attack an enemy, and the camera can sometimes be a bit unruly once burrowed in there. There’s also an odd visual issue I encountered fairly often where most of the environment would disappear into a purple-ish void for a second. I think this is related to the digging mechanic – most of the background is <em>supposed </em>to disappear when you’re fully immersed underground so as to eliminate visual clutter, and it seems like there are moments where the game detects you as being underground for a moment when you’re really not. It isn’t a huge deal, but it is a rather distracting issue in what’s otherwise a very visually-polished game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to DK’s core moves, you’ll also gradually unlock various Bananza forms, which allow you to transform into a muscled-up version of DK, a fast-dashing zebra, a flying (yes, flying) ostrich, and other animals. These transformations are on a timer, after which, you need to collect more gold to reactivate them. As such, Bananza forms aren’t as deeply integrated into level designs as, say, Mario Odyssey’s Cappy transformations. Most of the time, you can get by just playing as vanilla DK, with only certain obstacles – a fragile bridge you need to run over as Zebra DK here, an air-vent you can glide on as Ostrich DK there – requiring a transformation.</p>



<p>Most of the Bananza forms are fairly fun to play as, although that doesn’t mean they’re all created equal (I definitely have my favorites). DK Bananza also takes a surprisingly long time to introduce challenges that require switching between multiple forms – most of the game’s main stages are based around a single Bananza form. In addition to the various transformations, DK Bananza also introduces some light RPG elements, including a skill tree that allows you to upgrade your capabilities and an array of unlockable outfits that confer upgradable buffs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This version of DK is certainly a resourceful guy with a lot of different abilities to keep track of, but, of course, all the skills in the world don’t matter if a game doesn’t have good levels to put them to the test. Thankfully, Donkey Kong Bananza delivers on that front. DK Bananza is divided up into multiple descending layers, with DK diving between them in a similar fashion to how Link plunges into the Depths in Tears of the Kingdom. Most layers are further divided into multiple sublayers, with players sometimes having to travel up and down in order to access certain locations. A number of these individual sublayers are as large and complex (maybe even larger in some cases) as the biggest Kingdoms in Mario Odyssey. It all adds up to a world that feels more interconnected, and notably more complex, than Mario Odyssey's.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Individual layers run the gamut from more typical jungle, icy, and grassy plains settings, to more original themes, like one based around a full race track and even more out-there examples I can’t discuss at the moment. Even the more predictable level themes usually have some quirky twist that set them apart (like the fact that the artic layer is inhabited by desert-loving, parka wearing zebras for some reason).</p>



<p>Graphically, DK Bananza is a hearty feast for the eyes, with nearly every layer standing out as visually unique, impressive in scope, and packed with fun details, big and small. There are some layers that are arguably a bit over-busy, with efforts to create something original resulting in some clashing visual elements (think the Luncheon Kingdom from Mario Odyssey taken to another level) but these stages are the exception. By and large, DK Bananza is an impressive-looking game that usually runs well on the Switch 2 hardware, with only occasional performance issues during particularly frantic boss battles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, DK Bananza’s stages aren’t just varied and nice to look at, they’re also plenty of fun to play. That feeling of there being a secret or unique challenge around every corner you got in Mario Odyssey returns and is taken to a new level. Almost every layer of the game offers some sort of unique gameplay mechanic, some of which are truly wild and wonderful, like the glowing rocks you pluck in the Resort Layer that send you hurtling into the sky or the seeds from the Forest Layer that produce creeping vine bridges.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It should also be said, unlike Mario Odyssey, which took a relatively laid-back approach to progression, DK Bananza offers a more structured core campaign replete with a continuous series of missions, big cutscenes, and lots of boss fights. While there's certainly still plenty of room for aimless exploration, those looking for a game with more of a core driving force will find it here. Almost all the main campaign missions are fun, balancing unique challenges, epic moments, and a nicely-balanced level of difficulty. If there's one somewhat weak aspect of this core campaign, it may be the bosses, with many early ones being trivially easy and later ones becoming more challenging in a sometimes-frustrating way. That said, there are still some good boss fights in the game, they're just not as consistent as they could be.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza’s core campaign is certainly substantial – even with a fairly lean and focused playthrough, it took me around 16 or 17 hours to roll credits. Of course, like Mario Odyssey, there’s a seemingly-infinite amount of extra stuff to collect and some specific incentives for doing so. You're going to be tallying everything Bananza has to offer for some time.<strong></strong></p>

						<section>
				<p>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</p>
