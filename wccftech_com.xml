			<p>The Monster Hunter series is known for giving players tons of viable options to build their hunter, and Monster Hunter Wilds is no different, as even at the beginning of the adventure in the Forbidden Lands, you have a decent choice of gear coming with skills that are more or less useful, depending on the situation. For a newcomer to the series, however, even the few choices available at the start of the game can feel overwhelming. This, combined with the lack of knowledge regarding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-beginner-weapons-to-learn/">14 weapon types</a> and the general flow of the game, can make the first few hours of the game a little frustrating.</p>
<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds does an excellent job at introducing its core mechanics to the player, you are going to make a lot of mistakes as you hunt your very first monsters. As such, the first thing to look for in gear at the very beginning of the campaign is what it can offer in terms of survivability. In this regard, there's no better early choice than the<strong> Hope Mail</strong> and <strong>Hope Vambraces</strong>, which are both available from the start of the game and come with the <strong>Divine Blessing</strong> skill, which reduces received damage and activates fairly frequently. This will help you survive while you are learning how the game works.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250227115609_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Every other piece of gear available during the early game in Monster Hunter Wilds is generally fine for protection, but not as much for skills, so pick any option that looks good for you until you can craft either the <strong>Bone Helm</strong>, which requires 1 Mystery Bone, or the <strong>Alloy Helm</strong>, which requires 1 Machalite Ore and 1 Iron Ore which can be found rather easily on the Windswept Plain. The Marathon Runner skill of the first, which reduces Stamina depletion for actions that constantly deplete it, like running, and Quick Sheathe of the second, which makes you sheathe your weapon faster and lets you use items more quickly with the exception of the Sword and Shield that doesn't need to be sheathed to use them, are decent skills that can enhance your survivability.</p>
<p>For a good Coil and Greaves, you will need to proceed a bit further into the game until you can craft better gear.&nbsp;<span>The&nbsp;<strong>Balahara Coil and Greaves</strong> come with the Evade Extender skill that increases the distance of your dodge maneuver, which is a big help not only for defensive purposes but also for repositioning yourself when needed.</span> To craft them, you will first have to hunt a Balahara as part of the main campaign and then collect 1 Balahara Certificate, 2 Balahara Scales, 1 Balahara Shell, and 1 Balahara Pearl. for the Coil 2 Balahara Shells and 1 Balahara Skulls for the Greaves.</p>
<p>As Monster Hunter Wilds rewards experimenting with gear, these recommendations may not be the best for everyone and are based on my experience as a former newcomer who got pulled into the series with Monster Hunter Rise, before going back to playing older entries in the series, so you may find some other early game gear combination that could work better. In addition, these recommendations don't take the used weapon type into account. For any weapon that can guard and has an offset attack, like the Great Sword, for example, the <strong>Doshaguma Armor set</strong> is a good choice due to Doshaguma's Might, a set bonus that increases attack when Power Clashing against a monster or successfully deflecting an attack with an Offset attack. The Long Sword, on the other hand, benefits greatly from the <strong>Alloy Helm and Greaves</strong>, which come with Quick Sheate that speeds up all weapon sheating, including Special Sheathe, which you will want to learn to use properly if you want to master this weapon type. You will need 1 Machalite Ore and 1 Iron Ore to craft either of them and with some upgrades, they can potentially carry you throughout all of Low Rank.</p>

			<p>With 14 different weapon types and so many mechanics to learn, trying to get into the Monster Hunter series can feel daunting, and even with its streamlining of many of the experience's core mechanics, Monster Hunter Wilds can be difficult to get into for newcomers, since the game still plays like very little else on the market. Every journey, however, begins with a single step, and the very first step in any Monster Hunter game, including Wilds, is finding the best weapon not only to learn the game's intricacies but also to have fun relatively quickly. And just like monsters, not all weapon types are made the same, and some are better suited for beginners than others.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250215123352_1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds share some common traits. For starters, they have relatively simple game plans that don't require managing resources or multiple gauges to hit hard, have versatile movesets that include both solid offensive and defensive options and have very simple combos that don't require pressing multiple buttons.</p>
<p>The first weapon that falls perfectly into this category is the <strong>Sword and Shield</strong>. This weapon has some very simple combos that are still satisfying to pull off, no gauges to manage or multiple stances, a very functional guard, and the ability to use items without sheating the weapon, which is quite helpful when you are trying to learn the game.</p>
<p>The other three great beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds are slightly more complex than the Sword and Shield, but not by much, and still work great to learn the game. The <strong>Dual Blades</strong> are a little lacking in defensive options, as they cannot guard whatsoever and only have a perfect dodging mechanic that requires being in two of the three possible stances, but when it comes to offense, they are very straightforward with great mobility and some easy combos. The one thing that makes them slightly more complicated to use besides the lack of defensive options is resource management, as entering the powerful Demon Mode drains stamina. Keeping an eye on the Demon Gauge to enter Archdemon Mode once full adds a little more complexity, but the weapon's flow is generally pretty easy to understand, making it a solid choice for beginners.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226120617_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <strong>Lance</strong> is also a great beginner weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds thanks to its extremely good Guard, which can be kept up while attacking with its simple combos. Guarding also allows to counterattack when timed right, and with the addition of a few techniques that essentially allow Lance users to intercept monsters' attacks, the weapon is also great to learn some advanced techniques down the line that can be brought over to other weapons.</p>
<p>In past entries in the series, the <strong>Great Sword</strong> wasn't entirely a great beginner weapon. While its moveset was very simple, it required excellent positioning and good knowledge of monsters' tendencies and movesets to land those powerful True Charged Slashes. The buffing of the first two Charged Slashes in the weapon's basic combo, and the addition of Focus Mode, have made using the weapon much, much easier than in previous games, and the improvements made to guarding have made it more than viable to use, in addition to another advanced defensive tool, Offset Rising Slash, which allows you to intercept attacks with good timing. If you're looking for a weapon that hits very hard while being simple to use, the Great Sword is the weapon you want.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226115127_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While these weapons are, in my opinion, the best for beginners in Monster Hunter Wilds, there are a few additional choices that may be better suited for your playstyle. The <strong>Hammer</strong>, for example, is a good choice with a simple gameplan and combos, but it feels a little weak in the game at the beginning without a proper build, so it may prolong fights a little too much. The <strong>Long Sword </strong>comes with relatively simple gameplay as well, but<strong>,</strong> on the other hand, you will need to learn how to use its counterattacks properly, like Foresight Slash and Iai Spirit Strike from Special Sheathe, to use the weapon to its full potential, which can feel a little overwhelming if you're just starting out your Monster Hunter journey. The ranged weapons - <strong>Bow, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun</strong> - are decent choices for beginners as well, but they require resource management to deal serious damage, and I think they don't really teach you the game properly, as a ranged playstyle doesn't carry much over to a short range playstyle.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, you could potentially feel more at ease with even the more complex weapons in the game, like the Charge Blade and the Switch Axe, so you should definitely try them all to see which one feels the best for you. Monster Hunter Wilds is not a competitive game, so having fun remains the most important thing. Back when I started my Monster Hunter journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Rise</a> after many failed attempts over the years, I learned the game with the Long Sword before moving on to some more complex weapons like the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade, so don't stop at your first pick once you have learned the basics of the series' formula: you may find some more fun ways to play the game and enjoy it for longer!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has released the first gameplay trailer for its second project, the single-player open world survival game Prologue: Go Wayback. The Amsterdam-based developer also revealed that it will be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early access</a> starting this Summer for the rather low price of $20, which will not be increased after the end of the early access phase (estimated to be around a year).</p>
<p>In the game, players are dropped into a vast and wild landscape, equipped with just an old map and the basic tools to stay alive. The mission is simple: reach the weather station, but how to get there depends entirely on the player.</p>
<p>The world is dynamic and unpredictable. The weather can change at a moment's notice, forcing players to adapt to fierce storms and freezing temperatures. Gathering resources, finding shelter, and foraging for food will be essential. Extreme weather conditions can affect the character's stats. Items and even buildings found along the way can be repaired. Additionally, each playthrough will be completely different since it is generated by the studio's machine-learning technology.</p>

<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Brendan 'PlayerUnknown' Greene himself, diving deeply into his 10-plus-year plan to get the metaverse right. Prologue: Go Wayback follows the tech demo Preface: Undiscovered World (which is live now on Steam) and is a mid-step toward the final, full-fledged planet-sized massively multiplayer game codenamed Project Artemis. Unlike Preface and Artemis, it is made with Unreal Engine, albeit mixed with the studio's in-house custom machine learning terrain generation technology.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Greene said about Prologue: Go Wayback:</p>
<p><em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. It's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a testbed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-improve-seikret-controls/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-%E2%80%93-best-seikret-controls-to-use.1121526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-improve-seikret-controls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165234_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165952_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>
