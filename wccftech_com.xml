			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>
