			<p>A <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1859251588688162930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1859251588688162930%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge change to the microtransactions</a> is coming in Fortnite, meaning that you can get a ton of content for a fixed price each month. As of <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/">December 1</a>, Fortnite Crew will give you access to all of the following for no additional cost as long as you are an active subscriber:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Pass</li>
<li>Music Pass</li>
<li>Lego Pass</li>
<li>Any other new Pass that arrives</li>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Monthly Crew Pack</li>
<li>Crew Pack legacy styles</li>
<li>Rocket Pass Premium</li>
</ul>
<p>To get all of this content and the premium tracks of each pass, you simply have to pay $11.99 a month. This is a huge change from what it was previously, where you'd have to pay for each pass separately. It hasn't been stated why this change has been made, but there is already a lot of positive buzz around it on social media. Of course, since this means that players will have to pay substantially less to be able to access all of the rewards available, players are beginning to wonder what the catch is. Why would a huge company be favorable towards the players?</p>
<p>So far, it seems that you have to consistently be subscribed to Fortnite Crew to be able to get the rewards, whereas previously, players found that they could pay for Fortnite Crew every other month to get rewards at half the price. However, the rules have been updated to stop Fortnite players from doing that.</p>
<p>It's been stated that for new subscribers to Fortnite Crew, premium rewards on the Battle Pass will only be available to claim if your Fortnite Crew subscription is active. This means that if you cancel it halfway through the pass duration, you won't be able to claim any of the Premium rewards. Instead, you'll now only be able to claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of your current billing period rather than the remaining duration of the pass.</p>
<p>However, for players who are currently subscribed to Fortnite Crew or subscribe before December 1, there will be no changes made to you can claim premium rewards on the Battle Pass. However, should you cancel your Fortnite Crew subscription after December 1 and then resubscribe after your previous subscription has expired, you'll then be considered a new subscriber and will be in line with the new rules for the pass system.</p>
<p>To get any premium rewards on the Music Pass and Lego Pass, an active Fortnite Crew subscription will be needed to get access to the premium tracks. This will also apply to any new battle passes that are added in the future.</p>

			<p>If you've been looking at the upcoming MOBA Battle Royale Supervive, then you're in luck. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Open Beta</a> for SUPERVIVE has just kicked off today and is shaping up to be the next "10,000-hour" game in the multiplayer scene that is hoping to take the scene by storm. This title comes from industry veterans from Riot, Blizzard, Respawn, and Bungie, who have plenty of experience in the multiplayer scene. SUPERVIVE was first playable during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> and was a huge success, with the game being downloaded by over 15,000 players within 24 hours, with new players averaging at least 20 games of SUPERVIVE. To celebrate the release of the Open Beta for SUPERVIVE, a launch trailer has been released to showcase the features of the game and what you can expect from your time in SUPERVIVE. If you are curious, check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SUPERVIVE | Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auV1HOQi360?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who want to get stuck into SUPERVIVE's Open Beta, it will be available for players in North America, Europe, Asia, South America (Sao Paulo), and Korea via NEXON. Here, you can experience open-ended abilities from a hero shooter, with unique physics-based combat similar to Smash Bros, with a third combination of team-driven objectives similar to those you would see in a MOBA. Putting all of these elements together creates an action sandbox for people to get stuck into and sink plenty of time in.</p>
<p>Since Steam Next Fest, the Evolving Equipment system has been overhauled, with 24 new evolutions and unique traits to choose from and experiment with. Hunters now have Level 3 ability upgrades, which allow players to create a more customized playstyle. For those who may feel a little overwhelmed by what's going on in front of them, players will be able to pre-select starting loadouts, which can help them get acquainted with SUPERVIVE and how it all functions.</p>
<p>SUPERVIVE has multiple game modes to choose from, with the option to play in 4-player squads, 10-team battle royals, 2-player duos, and 4v4 deathmatches. In total, there are 16 unique hunters to choose from, each with their own abilities that make them special. All of the hunters are unlocked through spending time playing SUPERVIVE, meaning no money will have to be spent.</p>
<p>There are also new dynamic map features, such as Meteor Bosses, randomized hot zones that have high-tier loot that you can fight over, and new storm shifts that reshape the battlefield around you.</p>
<p>Will you be playing SUPERVIVE?</p>
