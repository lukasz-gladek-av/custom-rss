			<p>Tencent's TiMi Studio has finally pulled the veil from Monster Hunter Outlanders, the mobile game based on CAPCOM's franchise that was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-and-tencents-timi-studio-group-are-creating-a-new-monster-hunter-game-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the press release describes the game as an open world survival title. Players will explore and survive throughout unique regions of an open world map featuring natural environments, ecosystems and monsters. They'll get to craft and build custom equipment and tools and participate in the traditional hunting experience, where they can play solo or join a hunting party of up to four people.</p>
<p>TiMi Studio Group Producer Dong Huang said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s time for mobile players to fully enjoy what makes Monster Hunter one of the most beloved franchises in gaming. Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today.</em></p>

<p>No more information about the game's systems was released today, and no release date has been publicly set, either. The studio, which has a lot of experience adapting big franchises for mobile (they made the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/popular-strategy-game-age-of-empires-is-soon-coming-to-mobile-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires Mobile</a>, as well as the massively successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-immortal-gets-new-dev-update-activision-says-its-justified-by-call-of-duty-mobiles-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Mobile</a> and the not-quite-as-successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-unite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon UNITE</a>), said multiple playtests will be conducted in advance of the launch of Monster Hunter Outlanders. It is also likely there will be a staggered rollout throughout various regions, as usual for mobile games.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: it will be a very different experience compared to previous Monster Hunter mobile entries, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-riders-now-available-for-pre-registration-on-ios-and-android-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Riders</a> (which featured turn-based combat, whereas the series is renowned for its action combat) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Now</a>, a location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic.</p>
