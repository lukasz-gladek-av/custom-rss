			<p>Bungie studio head and chief executive officer Pete Parsons has announced that after 23 years with the studio, he is stepping down from his role and leaving the studio, and will be replaced by chief development officer Justin Truman.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">blog post on Bungie's official website</a>, with Parsons saying he is "<em>passing the torch</em>" to Truman, whom he has "<em>full confidence"</em> in as the person to move Bungie forward. Parsons has been the studio head since 2015, and has overseen the studio through some of its biggest highs, including the initial launch and success of Destiny 2, and more recently, its greatest lows, with multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">plagiarism cases</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">mass layoffs</a>, and a significant amount of internal turmoil, with former Bungie employees pointing the blame for all of Bungie's woes <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">directly at Parsons and the rest of Bungie leadership</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders,"</em> Parsons wrote.</p>



<p>For Truman's part, he reflected on his 15 years with the studio so far, as he moved from engineer, to designer, to producer, and to his current role before taking over as studio head as the chief development officer.</p>



<p>"<em>Across all of these different roles, Bungie’s purpose has stayed clear: 'We create worlds that inspire friendship</em>,'" Truman wrote. "<em>When we’re at our best – we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully,&nbsp;</em><em>overdelivers</em>."</p>



<p>Truman continued to briefly address the fact that Bungie has been having a rough go, to say the least, in recent years. To that end, Truman says he "<em>personally learned a lot over the years,"</em> and that he is "<em>committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them."</em></p>



<p>Will this really be a time of change for Bungie going forward? Only time will tell, but seeing as how Truman is part of that leadership suite that former employees were blaming Bungie's issues on, it could be more of the same. Hopefully, those former employees, and everyone else who has lost faith in Bungie in recent years, can be proven wrong.</p>

			<p>Konami has debuted the launch trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, showcasing the game one last time ahead of its long-awaited release one week from today, on August 28, 2025.</p>



<p>It's one last hurrah for the remake that Metal Gear Solid fans might have, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/">prior to its announcement</a>, hoped for, but never really believed would happen, since it seemed like Konami was letting its biggest series, like Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, rest for years without a new entry. Sure, leaks like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">NVIDIA GeForce Now list</a> provided hope, but until we all saw it with our own eyes, it was tough to believe.</p>



<p>Which is what makes the fact that we're a week away from its launch all the more exciting and unbelievable, and adds to the excitement around the fact that this launch trailer makes it seem like fans of what many believe to be the best game in the iconic Metal Gear Solid series will not be disappointed by the remake.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's even more to look forward to after its launch, with the revised <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">Fox Hunt multiplayer mode</a> that will be out this fall. It's unfortunate that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">won't feature crossplay between devices</a>, but we don't live in a perfect world.</p>



<p>If you've never played the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, you officially have one week to get through it if you want to experience it ahead of the remake's launch, and if you decide to go on that journey, you're in for a treat, since MGS3 is arguably one of the best videogames ever made.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 28, 2025.</p>
