			<p><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>, a star of both the Broadway stage and the big screen, has been named as the latest addition to the cast of <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>. It's another casting choice that deviates from the original games, as Patinkin will play <strong>Odin</strong>, replacing <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who played the character in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>It's the second casting announcement today, confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/">Deadline</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> was tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong></a>. Patinkin joins Ólafsson, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst </strong>as <strong>Kratos</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong>as <strong>Sif</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker </strong>as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, and is hopefully not the last casting announcement we see for a while, especially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">filming reportedly set to start in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the casting announcement we expected to see after Ólafsson, since <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">a recent rumour</a> that correctly identified Ólafsson, Palmer, and Parker's casting ahead of their actual confirmation pointed to <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> reprising his role as <strong>Mimir</strong>. Hopefully, that casting is accurate, as Duncan's performance is beloved by fans of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> games.</p>



<p>Beyond Mimir, we're still waiting to find out casting choices for characters like <strong>Baldur, Freya, </strong>and most significantly, <strong>Atreus</strong>. We also don't know if characters like <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong> will be included, though hopefully we'll know soon as more concrete details about the plot are revealed, beyond the confirmation that this show will pull from the Norse-based games, rather than the original Greek-based games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“AI is Theft, I Have to Use It, Otherwise I’ll Get Fired”: GDC Reports One-Third of Game Workers Are Using GenAI for Daily Tasks]]></title>

			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> is <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially out</a>, offering insights into the video game industry based on responses from over <strong>2,300 game industry workers</strong>. Respondents answered questions about everything from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/">industry layoffs</a></strong> to popular game engines and platforms, and the current, longstanding hot-button industry topic, <strong>Generative AI (GenAI).</strong></p>



<p>For some people in the video game industry, GenAI tools are the latest technological innovation that will revolutionize the game development process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"><strong>Everyone will use them if they aren't already</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they'll be as commonplace as anything else</a>. Others think <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/"><strong>there is absolutely no place for them</strong></a> in game development, not even if you're trying to ride that middle lane where you think <a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/">it'll be helpful for some things</a>, but nothing can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">replicate or replace the <strong>"<em>human</em>"</strong> element in creation</a>.</p>



<p>While <strong>one-third (35%)</strong> of respondents said they don't personally use GenAI for their jobs, a <strong>majority (52%) said GenAI tools are used</strong> at their studios, which has also resulted in more studios creating policies around its use. Only <strong>15% of respondents</strong> said their company did not have a policy on the use of GenAI tools, with <strong>78% confirming that there is policy language</strong> of some kind at their studio. The remaining <strong>7%</strong> said they were unsure.</p>



<p>Policies are also getting more specific, with <strong>22%</strong> of respondents saying that only specific tools are allowed and not others. Most are using LLMs like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-healths-integration-with-chatgpt-health-reportedly-allows-for-fallacious-and-inconsistent-diagnoses/">ChatGPT</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-gemini-siri-deal-is-worth-at-least-5-billion-for-google-indicating-that-the-deal-would-last-through-2030/">Google Gemini</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">Microsoft Copilot</a></strong>, which lines up for what they're using these tools for. "<em>Research or brainstorming</em>" was the most common response, with second going to daily tasks, including writing emails, code assistance, and prototyping. Only <strong>5% of respondents</strong> said they used GenAI tools for "<em>player-facing features</em>," <strong>10%</strong> for procedural generation, and <strong>19%</strong> for asset generation. </p>

<p>For some respondents, it's clear that these tools are essential, more for their efficiency than anything else. "<em>We are a small team, so it is making us capable of achieving more than we would without it</em>," said one respondent who is an executive working at an indie studio.</p>



<p>But even with this increased use and necessity, as the report reads, "<em>it appears the more the game industry professionals know about Generative AI, the less they like it</em>."  <strong>52% of respondents</strong> believe GenAI tech is having<strong> a negative impact on the video game industry</strong>. It's a <strong>30% bump</strong> compared to last year's GDC survey, but even within the negative majority are people who use it because they have to, or feel like they have to for their work. "<em>AI is theft</em>," begins one response from a developer in Ukraine. "<em>I have to use it, otherwise I'm gonna get fired</em>."</p>



<p>What's more interesting than looking at the percentages, though, are some of the quotes from individual developers who answered positively, negatively, or with mixed reactions about GenAI tools and tech.</p>

<p>Again, it should be noted that this annual survey is just a sample size; it's not a complete picture of the industry, and there's still a lot to be figured out with where GenAI tech lands not just in video games and video game development, but in other industries around the world.</p>



<p>At least with its increased use, more studios are writing guidelines as to how it should be used, and most of its use doesn't seem to make it to our actual monitors when we sit down for a night of gaming. That will likely continue to be what players care about the most, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/"><strong>Studio Atelico</strong> told Wccftech in a recent interview,</a> "<em></em><em><strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and 'slop.'"</strong></em> </p>
