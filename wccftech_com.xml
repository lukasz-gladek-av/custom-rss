			<p>Yesterday, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-out-now-with-game-ready-driver-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tomorrow-in-delta-force-black-hawk-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> integrated support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation as part of the game's third update. The game was also updated to support the latest DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution transformer-based AI models, which offer improved quality, as well as Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray tracing. Ray traced shadows also now optionally include all light sources, significantly increasing the quality of shadows in interior locations. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> also reveal good news for AMD and Intel owners, too:</p>
<p><em>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, the third Indiana Jones and the Great Circle adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology, allowing players without GeForce RTX 40 or 50 graphics cards to take advantage of frame generation in the game. Lastly, the patch&nbsp;also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<p>There are also a few technical fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements have been made to environment lights to present a more natural appearance when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency mode would cause inconsistent frame rates</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Nvidia Frame Generation became disabled when HDR was toggled on</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Indy’s hair was missing in reflections when using Path Tracing</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with light leaks in underground locations in Gizeh when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As we had assumed, the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair feature</a> is not available in this update. Indeed, the patch notes mention it as a possible addition for future Indiana Jones and the Great Circle updates alongside HUD modification, which the community has requested.</p>
