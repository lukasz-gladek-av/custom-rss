			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally official</a>. After a couple of years of speculation, the Japanese company has unveiled its upcoming console, which will be released at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago. Its unique concept of a hybrid handheld/home console won over the gaming world, making it one of the best-selling consoles ever, with over 146 million units sold as of the last update. However, Nintendo is no stranger to missteps like the Wii U, the GameCube, or even the Nintendo 64 to an extent. Early reception for the Nintendo Switch 2 seems positive, but we reached out to <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research Games Analyst Rhys Elliott</a> to get his perspective on the reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Rhys, didn't Nintendo play it too safe?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was smart of Nintendo to just make a bigger, better Switch. It is shrewd of them to leverage the inertia of the original. While the Nintendo Switch 2 plays it safe, the announcement video shows a range of quality-of-life improvements fans have wanted for years, such as a bigger screen (with a seemingly smaller bezel), a sturdier kickstand, and a bigger form factor for the Joy-Con. Nintendo might surprise us with something a little more out of left field, though — like that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored mouse functionality</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of the naming specifically?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The straightforward name of ‘’Switch 2’’ is the right choice. Nintendo learned its hard lesson from the Wii U’s confusing naming convention and the abject failure of that console. Many consumers – not just casual but core ones too – thought the Wii U was an add-on for the Wii, similar to the Wii Fit Balance Board or the Wii Motion Plus. This marketing fumble almost destroyed all the gains Nintendo made with the Wii. Things would have been dire if the Switch hadn’t become a cultural phenomenon. And Nintendo’s leadership – more conservative than ever before – understands that.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that Nintendo has all its console eggs in the Switch basket, it simply cannot risk confusing fans. After all, Nintendo’s cross-entertainment efforts across film, theme parks, toys, and even alarm clocks all lead back to its core console brand. If the beating heart of the brand fails, everything falls apart.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will core gamers flock to the Nintendo Switch 2 or not?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Core gamers are harder to please than more casual gamers and the general public. Other portable companion devices like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally likely have more processing power than the Switch 2, and core gamers will draw these comparisons. We expect that many of these vocal-minority gamers will buy the Switch 2 nonetheless. And they are not even Nintendo’s main target audience here – families and more casual players are.</em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo has been awfully quiet about the fan-favorite Metroid Prime 4, which is a niche series relative to Nintendo’s other properties but would attract some core gamers. And Pokémon fandom would find a faster-running version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A enticing, as framerate and performance issues seen in the Switch’s more recent Pokémon games have been a major pain point for that community.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the software outlook for the new console, both from first-party and third-party?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo confirmed that there will be Switch 2 exclusive games. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold over 64 million copies, so making Mario Kart 9 a Switch 2 exclusive would be very enticing to attract players to the new machine. Adding more characters and tracks based on Nintendo’s other franchises would appeal to the masses there. Based on the development timelines of their internal studios, it seems Nintendo has been sitting on a goldmine of titles to launch during the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch window. Alongside Mario Kart, I expect to see a new 3D Mario, an upgraded Pokemon, and likely some other surprises in year one. Nintendo will pull out all the stops.</em></p>
<p><em>It is worth noting that it’s been almost five years since Animal Crossing. The inevitable announcement of a sequel to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which has sold over 45 million copies and became a cultural zeitgeist, will mobilize cozy gamers in full force, too. A new Animal Crossing and Mario Kart would reactivate some of the consumers who played during lockdowns.</em></p>
<p><em>I think backward compatibility is important, too. It is what gamers – and younger ones in particular – have come to expect from the market. It is also what the competition has done with the Series X and PS5 generation. Nintendo would not want to alienate fans here.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What about third party studios?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Except for Ubisoft, many third-party publishers were late to the party with the original Switch, scared off by the Wii U’s underperformance. Things will be different for the Nintendo Switch 2, and third parties will get in on the ground floor. The Switch 2 offers up a springboard for third-party developers to extend the lifecycles of their game catalogs, promising engagement and revenue boosts for third-party developers big and small.</em></p>
<p><em>It will be an opportunity for EA, Ubisoft, and the like to extend the product life cycles of their older PS4- and Xbox One-era games. Speaking of which, Xbox and even PlayStation have been more to launching games on the Switch. I expect this will ramp up on the Switch 2 as these companies continue their off-platform strategies. I can already play Halo on my Steam Deck. I expect I’ll be able to play it on my Switch 2 one day, too.</em></p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new delay</a>, Ubisoft is throwing Assassin's Creed Shadows fans a bone in the way of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new deep dive</a> into the exploration part of the game. Game Director Charles Benoit reckons the studio won't hold the player's hand too much, unlike previous installments in the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We didn't want to hold the player's hand too much with icons and markers. We wanted to craft an open world where information was key and would become a form of reward. This made sense in the context of playing a shinobi and fighting for information. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, information is something you need to look for and earn, whether through your spies, NPC encounters, or through your own eyes. In short, we want players to discover all our cool secrets on their own terms through investigation, their spy network, or by observing the world. When exploring the world, you should look out for undiscovered locations (i.e. "?" icons), because there are so many interesting places to seek out, whether in a destroyed camp or a hidden shrine, we want you to always feel a sense of discovery.</em></p>
<p>Players will still climb to high places, the so-called Viewpoints. However, rather than revealing vast amounts of the map, they'll only uncover nearby interests after tagging them through the new observe mechanic (which does not include any companion Eagle, this time around). Each Viewpoint still unlocks a Fast Travel Point, but some are located in the heart of locations filled with enemies, so fast traveling there may not necessarily be a good idea.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Vantage Point" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnUlfHRHt7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While exploring each region, safehouses called "Kakurega" will become available for players to purchase. They become small extensions of the Hideout (the central, fully customizable home base) and offer some of its more practical functions, such as restocking rations/tools/ammunition, accessing gear stash, managing and accepting contracts, restocking scouts, and managing which allies can be called for help. Kakuregas also have Fast Travel Points of their own, and unlike the Viewpoints detailed above, they're always safe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, several of Japan's mountains won't be climbable due to their steepness. Due to this, Ubisoft warns players may sometimes be better off simply following roads, while supposed shortcuts may turn out to be unhelpful. If you get lost, though, there's a new toggleable Pathfinder feature that draws a white line overlay to highlight the best path to the objective, provided a quest is tracked and its location has been revealed to the protagonists by a scout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Pathfinder" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The quest log in Assassin's Creed Shadows is called Objective Board, which Ubisoft says will be key in investigating and locating the assassination targets. Zooming in on a specific target will reveal Opportunities - quest steps that can be individually selected and tracked.</p>
<p>Players are provided with clues as to the location of each opportunity, and they have to deduce where to investigate or go next by connecting the clues to your map.&nbsp;For those who prefer to have clear quest markers, deploying Scouts in the general area indicated by these clues will make things easier.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Target Board" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faWrGLgBBAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout Assassin's Creed Shadows, the protagonists will be joined by various Scout NPCs who will help them locate quest objectives, gather resources to upgrade the Hideout base, and even cover their tracks by resetting Provincial alerts.</p>
<p>Deploying Scouts lets players scan ahead and reveal a more accurate location for their quest objectives. The more scouts are deployed at once, the greater the scouting radius, increasing the chances of actually finding the target. This is also particularly useful if you have not collected all the clues to reveal your objective, as they can help fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Once deployed, Scouts return at the end of the season and become available again. However, players can choose to pay some in-game currency to a Kakurega to speed up their return to the base.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Scouts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ozpTwqHtXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Scouts are also useful to loot the various resource caches of the Wealthy clans, which are simply too large to be carried by a single person. Instead, you'll mark them with a flag to be smuggled out over time by the Scouts. At the end of the season, all flagged stockpiles will be cashed in to upgrade your hideout.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is out on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
