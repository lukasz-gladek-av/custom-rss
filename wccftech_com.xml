            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newegg, a reputable online retailer for electronics, gaming peripherals, and even games themselves, has <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the description</a> of their Nintendo eShop Gift Card. In the description, it now mentions games that haven't been announced yet, such as a "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster." At the moment, this information is still on their website and has caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>It is most likely just speculation on Newegg's side, as there have been hints at a new Mario Kart already, thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer, with a lot of the information surrounding it being analyzed by Nintendo fans. There are also titles mentioned, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-2025-original-switch/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was first announced at E3 in 2017 and has now been confirmed by Nintendo to be released in 2025, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated trailer</a> released <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">seven months ago</a>. Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also set to release this year. It's uncertain whether these titles will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 or whether they'll also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As we said above, it is most likely that this description from Newegg is just speculation based on Nintendo's release patterns, as well as what the fans are hoping for. Nintendo fans have been wanting specific Zelda remakes for a long time, with a lot of the audience begging for a remake or remaster of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Many other Zelda games could also be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2, such as A Link to the Past or Phantom Hourglass. However, those seem less likely.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that Nintendo will come up with a new Mario game to release for the Nintendo Switch 2, as Mario is Nintendo's mascot, and they always find ways to create new games surrounding Mario and his troupe. Whether that comes in the form of a new Mario Kart game, a Mario Party game, or even a Mario Sports game, there are plenty of options laid on the table for Nintendo.</p>
<p>With such a description hinting at the release of Nintendo's games that haven't even been announced yet, there is a likelihood that they will be contacted and asked to amend the description in the event that they are on the right track. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs, and has no issue in sending a cease and desist to someone or a company, regardless of how small they are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/virtuos-strategically-acquires-pipeworks-abstraction-and-umanaia-in-hopes-of-becoming-powerhouse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced today by Virtuos, a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading video game developer</a>, that they have strategically acquired three studios across the globe. Virtuos has helped co-develop games like Crash: Mind over Mutant, The Outer Worlds, Dead Island 2, and Hogwarts Legacy, for example. They have now announced that they have acquired Pipeworks (USA), Abstraction (Netherlands), and Umanaia (Canada). They have all worked on some very significant games, which will be detailed down below so you can get an idea of the kind of developers they are.</p>
<p>In the acquisition, they will each have their own role to play in the bigger picture, with Virtuos wanting to become a globalized powerhouse for "sustainable, flexible game development solutions." By acquiring these studios, it now allows Virtuos to offer a broader range of services across game development and live operations across the globe, with studios in Europe, Asia and North America. Thus far, Virtuos' has a network of studios across 26 locations worldwide, with their specializations being at the forefront of the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pipeworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pipeworks</a> will now be Virtuos' lead game development studio in North America, as they have a 25-year strong legacy, with experience working on titles such as Terraria and Call of Duty. The team is extensive, with nearly 200 employees working at the company to help co-develop titles for console, PC, and mobile. They currently have multiple AAA titles in development with studios such as Xbox Game Studios, PlayStation Studios, and Warner Bros. Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://abstraction.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a> has a significant co-development expertise, as their portfolio consists of major titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Dune: Awakening, with the company elevating Virtuo Labs' engineering capabilities. Their team consists of over 90 industry veterans, with their mission being focused on founding new technology and game prototypes to benefit and enhance the game development process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.umanaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umanaia</a>, who has a focus on original IPs and uses its experience in creating major titles such as Assassin's Creed and For Honor, and will be helping to bolster the ongoing process of creating Virtuos Originals. Their team is the newest, as it was founded in 2021. For the most part, they will be utilizing their expertise in Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) as well as their successful post-launch strategies. Alongside this, they will be refreshing beloved IPs and creating new experiences with the gamer in mind. Umanaia is also the smallest team, with over 40 senior developers, and will be working hard in the Virtuos Originals initiative.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-9-won%E2%80%99t-feature-jill-in-any-major-capacity-resident-evil-zero-remake-is-still-in-the-works.1088928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unlike what has been rumored for a while, Jill Valentine won't play a major role in Resident Evil 9, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, Dusk Golem commented on the rumors that have been circulating online on the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the survival-horror series, saying that Jill will not play a major role in the game, and the current hospital rumor that's circulating online is completely false, as are <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of rumors</a> circulating on the game. The information provided by the leaker is also fresh, as they have been updated on things more recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wait for actual RE9 news, nearly every RE9 rumor that's been floated around has been bullshit.</p>
<p>What's not bullshit is Silent Hill f did get rated in Korea today, and that's exciting.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1882066902023086459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides working on Resident Evil 9, CAPCOM is also continuing work on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Zero Remake</a>, which, much like the ninth main entry in the series, has also yet to be officially confirmed. The development of this remake saw a big change in the people involved, but development is still proceeding, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-new-resident-evil-9-details-surface.1027635/post-134699286">according to the insider, </a>so there's plenty for fans of the series to look forward to.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Resident Evil series is the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was launched in 2023. The remake is extremely faithful to the original, if not a little too much, as Nathan highlighted in his review. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of CAPCOM remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, CAPCOM hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>

			<p>The multiplayer games lists are always different since they necessarily intermingle with other genres. Looking at what's coming from the releases scheduled for the calendar year 2025, we have a mix of action, RPG, Soulslike, shooter, and more. Here's the five titles that stand out the most before their respective releases.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a></em></p>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Most of the early multiplayer games action this year will likely kick off with CAPCOM's Monster Hunter Wilds. Like Borderlands 4, it's a game that you can absolutely complete solo, but it's just that much more fun when played with friends. Like in the massively successful Monster Hunter World, players may launch a flare to ask for help from other players in the middle of a monster hunt. The much larger zones and dynamically shifting weather should make multiplayer sessions even more exciting in the new title. Lobbies will also get a significant increase in the maximum player count, supporting <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 players at once</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dune-awakening-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dune Awakening (Q1 2025 PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>Long before the two Dune movies were released in theaters, Funcom secured the license to develop games based on the franchise. They have since published the real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-spice-wars-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Spice Wars</a> (developed by Shiro Games), but the project they've really focused on is Dune Awakening. The studio is trying to funnel all its prior expertise in the MMORPG (Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World) and survival (Conan Exiles) genres into a hybrid game that brings out the best of both in the context of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Yes, players will have to survive the hazards of the desert planet, but there's also plenty of social play, where clans can be created and then affiliated with one of the major houses (Atreides or Harkonnen, to begin with). The key to everything will, of course, be the spice. Harvesting it will bring great rewards, as it can be traded or even consumed to gain powers (at the risk of addiction), but players will have to contend with other clans to secure the harvest - all the while trying not to rouse the dreaded sandworm. Dune Awakening is undoubtedly one of the most promising multiplayer games on this list, and it's also the closest to release. Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to launch it in the first quarter on PC</a>, with console versions to follow. For more info, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, and stay tuned for further coverage in the coming weeks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Let's face it - Borderlands fans may have fun with the single player, but the reason the franchise became popular in the first place was the chaotic cooperative multiplayer action. After all, any loot-based game gets instantly more addictive when you're playing with friends with whom to boast about the latest legendary drop you got after a crazy boss fight.</p>
<p>Gearbox hasn't shared specific multiplayer info for this new installment, but the confirmed presence of new tools like the grappling hook and the seamless zones will certainly bolster the cooperative portion of the game even further.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware caught everyone by surprise with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at The Game Awards 2024. Most people were betting on an immediate sequel to the massively successful Elden Ring, but the Japanese studio is first working on this intriguing spin-off. Based on what they've shared, it seems like they will be mixing elements from various genres, including survival and even Battle Royale (the shrinking map, specifically), to create an entirely new multiplayer experience. Players will have to survive for three in-game days before facing a final boss to end the session.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PromoNewN1.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>PIONER (TBA 2025 on PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>The upcoming MMOFPS by GFA Games was already featured in last year's most anticipated multiplayer games list. Now, though, it seems we are closer than ever to the release of PIONER, following the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The premise of a STALKER-like online shared world where players can cooperate to create clans, fight in PvE raids, and even compete in PvP areas, remains incredibly enticing. We'll have to evaluate the quality of the execution, of course. Hopefully, it won't be long until we get to play it.</p>
