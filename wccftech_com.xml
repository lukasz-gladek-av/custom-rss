			<p>Much to many people's surprise, Assassin's Creed Shadows is knocking it out of the park. While Monster Hunter Wilds was an incredibly big game, with it selling eight million copies in just a matter of days. On top of that, it reached 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows is hot on the trails of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached around<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/"> two million players</a> and is continuing to increase. Compared to Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin's Creed takes the lead in physical copies sold in the UK. At present, Shadows is the biggest physical launch of the year in the country, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring</a>.</p>
<p>This feudal Japan title saw it reach over one million players on launch day, despite the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-damning-reports-of-abuse-by-assassins-creed-shadows-studio/">controversy</a> throughout the advertising period of the game. It was also delayed multiple times, but it seems that was for a good reason, as most audiences who have played the game seem to be happy with what they've gotten from it.</p>
<p>With Assassin's Creed Shadows reaching over two million players, it means that it has now bested the performance of Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, two of the newer titles that performed incredibly well for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Dring also mentions that it has sold more boxed copies in one week than <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> did in three months, which is a bit of a harsh statistic for Ubisoft. However, for most, it won't come as a surprise, as even Ubisoft has acknowledged that Star Wars Outlaws did not perform in the way they wanted. In some aspects, Assassin's Creed Shadows was their final hope to produce something in recent years that had the chance to be majorly successful, as Assassin's Creed Mirage didn't quite hit the mark for some players, either.</p>
<p>However, there are still plans for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/"> first DLC</a> to be released for Assassin's Creed Mirage, with ongoing support and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-gets-a-free-dlss-3-mod-thanks-to-lukefz/">mods</a> being released for the title.</p>
<p>While the game holds this very impressive information at the moment, it is likely that it will have it snatched from them by releases such as Call of Duty, Mario Kart 9, or Grand Theft Auto VI, should it be released this year.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this game, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Francesco De Meo's review</a> of the title, where he gave it a generous score of 8.7, calling it a "gorgeous dive into feudal chaos."</p>

			<p>Multiple Xbox games will hit the Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 5 consoles this year besides those that have already been announced, according to a new report shared online today.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release date announcement for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/">PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">stated</a> that 2025 will include a lot more titles appearing on PlayStation 5 and the next-generation Nintendo console. Which former Xbox console exclusives will make the jump has yet to be seen, but it wouldn't be surprising to see any of these games make an appearance during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has yet to reveal which games will hit rival formats next, there's a very good chance that Starfield will be among the next to release at least on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">Earlier this month</a>, the console's logo appeared on Creation listings, suggesting that the game's announcement and release could be imminent.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Fable series could be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">multiplatform release</a> right from launch, as work on other console versions of the game has reportedly already begun. With the game having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/">delayed</a> to 2026, a multiplatform launch has become even more likely, although it remains to be seen how the Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to handle the game, given its lower specs compared to the other current-generation systems.</p>
