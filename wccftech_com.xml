			<p>Today, TEAMGROUP announced the launch of its new <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/product-detail/card/TEAMGROUP/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express-TAPMSDE1TIV30A102/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEX SD7.1 MicroSD Express Card</a>, which promises 'next-generation high-speed storage for handheld gaming'. Its primary usage case is, of course, with the Nintendo Switch 2 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 features a PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and NVMe protocol and has an A1 rating for application performance, delivering significantly faster data transfer speeds. Thanks to the PCIe lane, the APEX SD7.1 offers read speeds far beyond those of traditional microSD cards of up to 800MB/s, which is 8x and 2.6x faster than the TEAMGROUP ELITE MicroSDXC A1 V30 (max 100MB/s) and T-CREATE EXPERT SDXC V90 (max 300MB/s), respectively.</p>
<p>It offers optimal performance on devices with a MicroSD Express slot, such as the aforementioned Nintendo Switch 2, but it remains fully backward compatible with handheld consoles and mobile devices that support standard MicroSD cards, such as the original Switch or Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>TEAMGROUP produced the card in capacities of 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1TB, with the highest capacity model able to store up to 18 games (assuming the average size is 26.8GB, like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt â€“ Complete Edition). It also supports Video Speed Class V30 and 4K UHD video recording, making it ideal for capturing smooth, high-resolution footage.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 has multiple protection features to ensure durability and quality. It is resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments. The product includes a limited lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pricing details are not available yet. We have contacted TEAMGROUP to get them and will update this story if we receive them.</p>

			<p>The pirate-themed multiplayer survival adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crosswind</a> has opened up its Alpha Test <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, and anyone can now request access for a chance to join and check out this interesting title. This Alpha Test phase will run for at least four weeks, and there is no NDA, so those who are selected will be able to share their impressions, images, and videos captured while playing.</p>

<p>In a recent Steam blog post, the Crosswind Crew also clarified that this is a survival adventure game first and foremost, and that's the focus of this playtest, while an MMO-like layer is planned to be added later.</p>
<p><em>The game's structure is as follows: 'A player-controlled world plus various shared zones'. Each player has their own world in which the main story unfolds. This is a large archipelago comprising a dozen islands, a variety of biomes, resources, enemies and secrets. Most of it is procedurally generated, but some of the key points of interest are hand-crafted. This means that your world won't be the same as your friend's. You have full control over who can visit your world. You can keep it private. Alternatively, you can invite your friends to explore, craft and build with you, or even fight alongside you.</em></p>
<p><em>The MMO part of Crosswind consists of shared zones for various PvE and PvP activities. As you progress through the main story, you will unlock the ability to travel to other locations. These are shared among players. For example, in the upcoming playtest, we will have an early prototype of Tortuga. For now, it's just a place to trade goods and meet other players, but in the future, we'll transform it into a bustling social hub where you can discover new activities, make new friends, and even challenge someone to a duel! Other zones and activities, such as a naval PvP zone, will be added later in the development process, thus expanding the MMO part of Crosswind. We see PvP as an additional way to enjoy the game. It will be optional and take time to implement properly.&nbsp;</em></p>
