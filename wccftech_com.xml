			<p><strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> may have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-all-the-sins-we-bear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released five and a half years ago</a>, but gamers are still discovering new things about it. <a href="https://x.com/Speclizer_/status/2003541114201002410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to modder Speclizer</a>, <strong>Naughty Dog</strong> had implemented a <strong>'Hold Up'</strong> feature that was cut from the final game. This allowed Ellie to sneak up behind an enemy, force them to put their hands up, and subsequently control where they would move next and also whether to face toward Ellie or away from her. Eventually, they would try to pull out their weapon in an attempt to fight back.</p>



<p>Since Naughty Dog left this unused animation and script in the game, Speclizer is now looking to add it back to The Last of Us Part II, although it will apparently require 'quite a bit of work'. Of course, this would only be available for the PC version, since the PlayStation 5 version is not moddable. This feature may<span> only be initially available to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/Speclizer" target="_blank">Speclizer's Patreon</a>&nbsp;backers</span>. The modder offers access to all tools and mods with the Tier 2 subscription, which costs €12,50 per month. Speclizer previously released the Project FEDRA and Endure Survival game modes for The Last of Us Part I.</p>

<p>Project FEDRA is a new gameplay experience where the playable character is a FEDRA soldier tasked with maintaining order and completing critical missions, which reward players with ration cards, the currency of the Quarantine Zone. The cards can then be used to purchase weapons and gear to aid in future missions. Speclizer has plans to port it to The Last of Us Part II as well.</p>



<p>Endure Survival, on the other hand, is a more classic wave-based Horde mode with a shop system (players can buy gear between rounds at Bill's store).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, series creator Neil Druckmann led fans to believe that The Last of Us Part II might very well be the last game in the franchise, later adding that the situation could only change if he and Naughty Dog can come up with a new story worth telling. However, three months ago, Druckmann teased 'various The Last of Us' things he is working on after stepping back from his role in the HBO TV adaptation, heavily suggesting a new game is indeed in the works. First, though, the studio based in Santa Monica, California, has to complete its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't launch before 2027</a>. This means fans of the post-apocalyptic franchise may have to wait several more years before returning to the world infected with the mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.</p>

			<p>Fans of the dragon-themed platform series owned by <strong>Activision</strong> are getting an early Holiday present this year with the leaked news that a <strong>Spyro 4</strong> game is in development. The information was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQsIoR2rXk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Canadian Guy Eh', who noticed that a former <strong>Toys for Bob</strong> developer included on his LinkedIn resume that he worked on 'Spyro' for nearly two years up until March 2024.</p>



<p>Given the timeline, this cannot possibly be related to the <strong>Reignited Trilogy</strong>, which was first released on November 13, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-confirmed-for-pc-switch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted on PC and Nintendo Switch</a> on September 3, 2019. Chances are, then, this is the next project in development at Toys for Bob.</p>



<p>Some readers may recall that the studio, based in Novato, California, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-developer-suffers-layoffs-will-work-on-call-of-duty-warzone-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assigned to assist with Call of Duty Warzone</a> for a period of time in 2021. Toys for Bob later launched <strong>Crash Team Rumble</strong>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-rumble-is-all-about-taking-platforming-into-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4v4 team-based multiplayer game</a>, in June 2023. The game wasn't received well, though, and by March 2024, the studio had decided to separate from Activision (and therefore from its new owner, Microsoft), <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-goes-indie-but-will-still-likely-partner-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regaining its independence</a>. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bobs-first-independent-game-will-still-be-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, their first independent project is still expected to be made in partnership with Microsoft and, therefore, based on one of its IPs, of which Spyro is certainly one they're familiar with.</p>



<p>A Spyro 4 rumor actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-4-teased-in-crash-4-its-about-time-art-book-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first circulated five years ago</a>, when it was discovered that the official art book of the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></strong> (also developed by Toys for Bob) included new concept art related to the cute purple dragon.</p>



<p>While we wait for an official announcement, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/spyro-reignited-trilogy-classics-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Reignited Trilogy</a> is currently available at a 65% discount on PC (Steam) and Xbox, whereas PlayStation users can only buy it at full price ($39.99) right now via the PlayStation Store. Spyro Reignited Trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can also be found on the Game Pass subscription</a> service at the Premium and Ultimate tiers.</p>
