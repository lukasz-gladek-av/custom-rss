			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation</a>, the company confirmed that as of March 31, 2025, for the first time in this console generation, PS5 monthly active users have surpassed PS4 monthly active users, which means that more players on PlayStation are finally starting to make the transition to the current generation of hardware.</p>
<p>Just last year, when Sony gave this presentation in May 2024, Sony confirmed that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-of-all-playstation-gamers-are-yet-to-upgrade-to-ps5-sony-stats-reveal">split between PS5 and PS4 players was still 50/50</a>. For one reason or another, four years into the PS4 generation, players were not leaving their old consoles behind. In the past year though, that's changed.</p>
<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino was speaking, the presentation featured this slide, showing that PS5 players are taking up the majority of PlayStation's 124 million monthly active users.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the new 124 million active users figure is an increase from the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-registers-new-123-million-monthly-active-users-record-in-december-2023/">123 million active users PlayStation saw in 2023</a>, which was already a record-setting figure for Sony.</p>
<p>"<em>Our platform is stronger than ever</em>," said Nishino. "<em>We continue to attract more players, and we now have over 124M monthly active users. Through the wide range of content and services we provide, these players are more engaged than ever, which has resulted in record-high gameplay hours. Our platform is also more accessible than ever. The PlayStation 5 offers the best way for players to experience our content, and as such, this player base has continued to grow</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These players are highly engaged, spending more on the content and services than in prior generations,</em>" Nishino continued. "<em>However, the PlayStation 4 remains an important access point for existing players to experience our content and services, and we remain committed to serving them</em>."</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the PlayStation 5's launch, there was plenty of talk about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5">PlayStation believing in generations</a>, only for the company to confirm that most of its big titles coming to PS5 would also be coming to PS4. It's clear that things have changed at this point, with the PS4 still being a big chunk of PlayStation's player base.</p>
<p>In the same annual presentation, PlayStation even confirmed that it is committed to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-committed-to-exploring-a-new-and-enhanced-way-to-engage-with-content-and-services-multiplatform-strategy-set-to-remain-the-same-for-the-foreseeable-future/">multiplatform strategy going into the next generation</a>.</p>

			<p>PlayStation executives <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_01_ja/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in a fireside chat with investors earlier today. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino talked about the platform's future, as reported in this article, while Hermen Hulst, who now heads the Studio Business Group but reports to Nishino <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-leadership-changes-again-nishino-takes-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the latest shuffle</a>, talked about Sony's commitment to making and maintaining live service games following early successes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>) and failures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>). On that note, Hulst said that while much work went into Concord, the game launched into a hyper-competitive segment and was not unique enough to stand apart. Needless to say, the goal is to avoid repeating the same mistakes with PlayStation's next big live service launch, Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We remain very committed to building a diverse and resilient live service portfolio. We have MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2. These are really good examples of the type of titles that we're looking to develop. These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres. Together, that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category. I would say that, additionally, we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve if we get everything right. That game has been a true breakout success. It's been attracting and retaining a significant community. This ongoing success is further evidenced in how we deal with the monetization, as microtransactions now make more than half of that game's revenue. We're also very excited about Marathon's anticipated launch in this fiscal year.</em></p>
<p><em>With live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us, but with that great opportunity, there are some unique challenges associated. We've talked about the early success with Helldivers 2, but we also faced some challenges with the release of Concord. I think that some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately, that title entered a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. We have reviewed our processes to ensure that we're not going to make those mistakes again. We have introduced much more rigorous processes for validating our creative, commercial, and development assumptions, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>That plan will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines. For Marathon, it's our goal to release a very bold, very innovative and deeply engaging title. It's going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade, so we are really excited for that release. Going through the test cycle, we're monitoring the Closed Alpha that the team have just gone through. We're taking all the lessons learned and we're using the capabilities we've built to understand how audiences are engaging with the title. Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But that's super useful; that's why you do this testing. When launch comes, we're going to give the title the optimal chance at success. This cycle of test, iterate, test again, it's such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game.</em></p>
<p>Marathon, an extraction first-person shooter game based on the old Bungie franchise, will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on September 23 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
