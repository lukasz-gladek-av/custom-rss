			<p>Avowed launched in Early Access yesterday, with those who played it giving positive feedback on the game. This title comes from the beloved studio Obsidian Entertainment, which has also made games such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, and more. Avowed launched exclusively on Xbox and Steam, offering a premium early access period for an additional $10 where the game will then launch on Xbox Game Pass next week.</p>
<p>As the game launched, an uproar began regarding Avowed's early access being live on Xbox Cloud Gaming, as reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-avowed-early-access-inexplicably-skips-xbox-cloud-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Central</a>. However, it seems that regardless of whether or not you bought the premium edition of the game, it simply would not be going live on Xbox Cloud Gaming until next week.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Avowed's early access period is currently available on the rival cloud service, NVIDIA GeForce Now. This seems like a bit of a strange choice, especially since Obsidian Entertainment is a part of Xbox Game Studios. It doesn't seem to make much sense that Microsoft wouldn't try to peddle its own services rather than benefit a rival one.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">how expensive</a> the Ultimate Game Pass subscription is, after receiving a price hike, it seems quite unfair that Microsoft wouldn't put loyal customers at the forefront and give them what they wanted by allowing them to have advanced access to the game that they paid for.</p>
<p>In addition, with the new ability to "buy to own" games on Xbox Cloud Gaming, a brand-new title such as Avowed would have been the perfect opportunity for this new feature. The system supports DLC entitlements for those who purchase deluxe editions of a game, which, by rights, should include the ability to access the game early, as stated when purchasing. However, as shown in a <a href="https://x.com/mrbobman15/status/1890114317569360154?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, a user purchased the Premium Edition and found that it was nowhere to be seen on Xbox Cloud Gaming. At the time of writing, Microsoft has yet to explain why this is.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's very uncertain as to why Microsoft has made this decision and whether it was just a massive oversight by people working at Microsoft or whether this was an intentional move to cozy up with a rival cloud gaming service. Either way, it's left those on Xbox feeling slighted and ripped off after not being able to get their money's worth. Whether or not the company will respond to those who have left complaints on social media remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>In a talk at this week's D.I.C.E. Summit <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via PCGamer</a>, an industry conference took place where the theme was sustainability. At this talk, Obsidian Entertainment VP of Operations Marcus Morgan and VP of Development Justin Britch said that they want Obsidian Entertainment to make it to its 100th birthday. Considering the rocky state of the game industry at present, this seems like something that is highly unlikely. However, Obsidian Entertainment does have a history of making incredibly popular games, such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds, and most recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/"> Avowed</a>.</p>
<p>Obsidian is currently 22 years old, which means that the company has a further 78 years to go. The VPs think that this is incredibly doable as long as they stick to the ideas of staying lean, keeping talent, and setting realistic sales expectations. Compared to other companies, Obsidian is more focused on making games that sit well with the players and have an impact rather than focusing solely on the amount of money it can make.</p>
<p>One of the main pillars in the plan for sustainability is staying "lean and invested," with the company remaining small enough so that none of the employees at the company feel like a cog in a machine and still feel human and impactful in the company. However, it wasn't always this way, as Morgan and Britch stated that they had considered opening up studios internationally but decided not to go ahead with it in the event it weakened Obsidian's pre-existing work culture.</p>
<p>Instead of funneling all of the company's money into a single project, hoping that it will make a massive profit, Britch says that the studio spends time determining how much to invest in the project based on the assumption that it will be a "mild success," rather than a smash hit. This is something that companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft could learn from, as they have both recently funneled money into two major projects (<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-staff-says-game-was-referred-to-as-the-future-of-playstation/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, respectively.) with neither turning out quite the way they wanted.</p>
<p>While no names were mentioned during this talk at the D.I.C.E. Summit, there are some very clear examples that come to mind. Namely, the sales expectations of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game didn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/">perform nearly as well</a> as EA and BioWare were expecting. As a result, EA laid off staff at BioWare.</p>
<p>Thus far, from the three titles Obsidian Entertainment released in the 2020s, the company has been largely successful with its efforts. Both critics and the general audience have received Grounded, Pentiment, and Avowed positively.</p>
<p>If the company continues on this straight and narrow path, it stands a good chance of making it to its 100th birthday.</p>
