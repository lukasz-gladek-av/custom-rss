			<p>Amidst controversies <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">surrounding its use of Generative AI tech for NPC voices</a>, Embark Studios' latest release, the third-person extraction shooter ARC Raiders, continues its sales streak, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-dominated-steam-again">Alinea Analytics</a>, it has almost reached 7 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p>After selling close to 750K copies on Steam last week, Alinea Analytics reports that ARC Raiders is at 4 million copies sold on Steam alone, and is due to reach the 7 million mark soon. Last week, the game's publisher, Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">reported that it had officially sold over 4 million copies.</a> </p>



<p>It's further proof that ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the video game industry's biggest hits in 2025. It was even one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shooters-dominated-october-2025-revenue-mau-charts-battlefield-6/">top 20 games for MAU and revenue in Newzoo's October 2025 report</a>. Though, as is the case with all multiplayer games, a strong launch is only the beginning. Now, it's about consistency in the long run. It'll be interesting to see where the game stands a year from now.</p>



<p>Other notable titles in Alinea Analytics' latest report include PEAK closing in on 15 million copies sold, making it one of the biggest indie titles of the year. RV There Yet? and AdHoc Studio's Dispatch were also two of the top-selling games on Steam last week, as indie games continue to have a strong showing this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto reviewed ARC Raiders</a>, giving the game a 9/10 and praising its sound design, gameplay loop, map design, and more. "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>
