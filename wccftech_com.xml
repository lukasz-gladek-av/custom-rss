			<p>It's been over half a year since we had any update from developer <strong>inXile</strong> on their next game, the steampunk RPG <strong>Clockwork Revolution</strong>. Following a new trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown at the 2025 <strong>Xbox Game Showcase</strong></a> in June, inXile founder and CEO <strong>Brian Fargo</strong> had claimed the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would feature 'truly evil' options for players and multi-person dialogues</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Fargo has been featured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clockwork-revolution-could-be-the-most-expressive-xbox-rpg-in-years-with-inxile-aiming-to-bring-the-level-of-reactivity-from-our-isometric-titles-into-something-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new interview published by GamesRadar</a> in which he described Clockwork Revolution as <strong>the studio's most ambitious game</strong> 'probably by a factor of 10', on account of them trying to translate the level of interactivity usually seen in isometric games into a first-person action RPG.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Fargo once again stressed the importance of building truly alternative options for players to choose, even if that means creating more content that can be seen in a single playthrough.</p>



<p><em>For me, roleplaying means I can play a role and actually affect the world around me. If all paths lead to the same outcome, the immersion breaks, and you start to feel like you're just playing a game rather than living in one. But when the world is constantly reacting and reflecting your choices, both in big ways and just as importantly in small ways, that's when immersion really sets in.</em></p>



<p><em>We probably build roughly 30% more content than what any player could see in a single playthrough. We want players to be able to approach the game as a different archetype, whether you want to be good, evil, or something in between. Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path. We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made for them. We also have a very dark sense of humor, which makes all of it even more fun.</em></p>



<p>Clockwork Revolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first showcased during the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The game doesn't have a release date, so unless Microsoft and inXile are secretly planning a late 2026 launch, we're probably going to have to wait until 2027 to play it. As a reminder, inXile's previous game, <strong>Wasteland 3</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in August 2020</a>. </p>



<p>The game is currently announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, although given Microsoft's multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually lands on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, too.</p>

			<p>In September 2025, insider <strong>Nate the Hate</strong> (who just won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award as voted by Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors) <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the rumor</a> that <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, would launch this year on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2. It seems <strong>Square Enix</strong>'s plan in this regard hasn't changed, at least according to the insider, who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013735117735313739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it on X</a> in response to a follower's question.</p>



<p>If true, it would mean that Xbox and Nintendo gamers are getting both released games in the trilogy in the same year. The first one, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong>, is launching today on both platforms. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a free demo</a> that stunned gamers particularly for its great visuals and performance on the Nintendo Switch 2, which <strong>almost looked on par with the PlayStation 5 version</strong>. The developer had previously also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-actually-solid-spec-wise-ffvii-remake-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken well of the Xbox Series S</a>, saying they had no problem porting FFVII Remake Integrade to the platform, except for a few memory-related challenges. </p>



<p><strong>Porting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will undoubtedly be more challenging</strong>, though, especially for the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2. The more recent game has a far larger scope and open world-like environments that will be quite taxing on the CPU, unlike the first game's fairly linear maps. Because of this, a 2026 launch would be all the more impressive, provided it is decently optimized. For comparison, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playable-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is playable on the Steam Deck</a>, but only with some major performance and graphics caveats.</p>



<p>Series aficionados are also waiting with bated breath for news about <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. Last month, director <strong>Naoki Hamauguchi</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it was almost time for its unveiling, and fans thought it would happen at The Game Awards 2025, but it didn't. That said, it could be shown at the next State of Play, whenever that will be. As with previous games, the game will likely launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 first.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BF Labs Players Will Get First Crack at Testing Battlefield 6’s New Season 2 Map and a BF4 Map That’s Being “Rebuilt for Today’s Battlefield”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After an <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/"><strong>extremely strong launch</strong> that carried it</a> to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the <strong>best-selling games of 2025</strong></a>, <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> could not have gotten off to a worse start to 2026 than by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">delaying the arrival of Season 2.</a></strong> If you can't wait for the entire extra month it'll now take to arrive, then the clear answer is to do everything you can to get into <strong>Battlefield Labs</strong>, as <strong>EA</strong> announced that players participating in BF Labs will get to test out Season 2's new map, <strong>Contaminated</strong>, and everyone's favourite mini helicopter, <strong>Little Bird</strong>.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the main additions coming in Season 2 that BF Labs players will get their hands on first, as EA and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> continue to test and tweak things for the upcoming season. In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond">a blog post on the game's official website,</a> the BF Studios team outlined that the new map falls somewhere between the size of <strong>Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Mirak Valley</strong>. To give you a potentially better idea of how big it is, the team adds that it's "<em>comparable</em>" to maps like <strong>St. Quentin Scar</strong> from <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> or <strong>Arras</strong> from <strong>Battlefield V</strong>.</p>



<p>Contaminated and Little Bird are all that BF Labs players will be testing in the next session EA hosts, but the BF Studios team is quick to point out it'll be doing a lot more testing, and that future tests will be "<em>more exploratory</em>," including testing out different aircraft and vehicle systems. There are also adjustments to RPGs and vehicle interactions incoming, to potentially re-tune how vehicles can respond to RPGs and TOW launchers, and how those weapons impact vehicles.</p>



<p>There are other changes not outlined in the blog post that EA and BF Studios say will arrive in time for Season 2, and there are even more changes that won't arrive until after Season 2. Including the return of a <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> map that EA and BF Studios call a "<em>fan-favorite</em>" map: <strong>Golmud Railway</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s Battlefield, not simply ported forward," </em>the blog post reads.<em> "Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Lastly, EA and BF Studios did bring up the popular topic of a <strong>Solo Queue</strong> for its battle royale mode, <strong>REDSEC</strong>. While there's no indication that it'll be testing Solos in REDSEC anytime soon, the team is still testing it internally to help the team understand "<em>where Solo play can best fit within the broader battle royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other battle royale experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration. Any future player-facing testing would be approached with the goal of learning and validation, and we’ll share more details ahead of time if and when those tests are planned.</em>"</p>



<p>Upsetting as it is that we'll have to wait longer than expected for the arrival of Season 2, it's at least good to know what EA and the BF Studios teams are looking to test in the meantime. Now that we're more than a few months into Battlefield 6 being in players' hands, it's also interesting and encouraging to see BF Studios lean on BF Labs like this, so that players get the chance to try out what's coming to the game, and provide feedback that could, realistically, help EA avoid a season so collectively hated that it kills any momentum the game had.</p>
