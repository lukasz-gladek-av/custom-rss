			<p>Today, Funcom has published a new exploration trailer for the upcoming massive multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. The video goes through the basic progression every character will have to go through after crash-landing on Arrakis: first, surviving, crafting a stillsuit, founding a home base, and making vehicles to roam the desert planet.</p>
<p>Eventually, players will venture to the biggest and most dangerous map, the Deep Desert. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> earlier by Game Director Joel Bylos, this huge map can house hundreds of players at once and is always PvP enabled.</p>
<p><em>The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>
<p>In today's trailer, Funcom also remarked that the Deep Desert map will reset every week, explained in-world by the massive Coriolis Storms, which will sweep over the map and change it. This also means Dune Awakening players will then get to explore as if it were new when it comes to its points of interest and resource nodes. It's even possible for explorer types of players to get in there just after the reset, survey the map, and then either share it with allies and clan members or sell it on the Exchange, the game's version of the traditional MMO-style auction house.</p>

<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game will launch on PC in a little over two months. Its benchmark and character creator tool are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on Steam, though.
