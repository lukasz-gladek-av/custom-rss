			<p><strong>SEGA</strong> has just released its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/">third-quarter financials</a> for its current fiscal year, and while some of its numbers don't look as strong as the company may have hoped, like having to incur <strong>$200 million</strong> <strong>impairment</strong> by devaluing <strong>Rovio</strong>, the <strong>Angry Birds</strong> maker that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-buys-angry-birds-rovio-to-expand-in-mobile/">acquired back in 2023</a>, its future outlook has a lot for players to look forward to.</p>



<p>In the segment of its presentation regarding its initiatives for the next fiscal year, SEGA lists that it plans "<em>to release four major new titles for mainstay IPs</em>." The next fiscal year will take us all the way to <strong>March 2027</strong>, which means that if SEGA can hit its goal, it will have <strong>four new games</strong> from its <strong>biggest franchises</strong> on shelves for players to grab.</p>



<p>Outside of a new <strong>Sonic</strong> game looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/did-you-like-frontiers-leaker-teases-next-sonic-game-as-community-pleads-for-more-than-just-sonic-on-generic-ue5-terrain/">follow up <strong>Sonic Frontiers</strong></a>, which has not yet been officially announced, the upcoming games we know about from SEGA that don't yet have a release date include: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/">Total War: Medieval III</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">Persona 4 Revival</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There's also the question of the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter Project</a></strong>, the upcoming sequel to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-sequel/">Alien: Isolation</a></strong>, and SEGA's efforts to reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/"><strong>Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, </strong>and <strong>Shinobi</strong></a>. And, of course, we're also still waiting on news for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-6-release-logo/">Persona 6</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Save for a few obvious franchises like Sonic, Persona, and Virtua Fighter, it's unclear what SEGA is referring to when it talks about "<em>mainstay IPs</em>." After having to write down Rovio and seeing a <strong>54.6%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its operating income and a <strong>51.8%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its ordinary income due to recent releases falling short of expectations, SEGA knows it needs its next batch of releases to hit a little higher.</p>



<p>It all comes down to what could be ready and what it believes will be the game to set it on that path to commercial success. If we really do have a flurry of major SEGA games coming from now until March 2027, then we'll hopefully know more about SEGA's plans soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance Next-Gen Update Delivers A ‘Performance Leap With Up to 60FPS, Ultra-Quality Settings’ On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-next-gen-update-60-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although a little <strong>rough around the edges</strong>, the original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> managed to carve out its niche with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most immersive medieval open-world role-playing games ever</strong>, making it easy for many fans of the genre to look past its <strong>technical shortcomings</strong>, especially on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>From today, however, even console players will be able to enjoy the first entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhorse Studios</strong> at its best, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/"><strong>previously rumored</strong></a> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Next-Gen Update</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Announced during today's <strong>Warhorse Studios Anniversary Celebration Stream</strong>, the Next-Gen update allows players to <em>"experience Henry's journey like never before,"</em> delivering a <strong>significant performance boost with up to 60 frames per second, ultra-quality settings, and improved visual assets</strong>. </p>



<p>Though short, the launch trailer below does a good job showing how much the game has been improved for current-generation consoles, and with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">cross-generation save transfers</strong>, returning to 15th-century Bohemia will be easier than ever. All existing owners can also download the update <strong>for free.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>While the high-quality settings and improved assets are welcome, the biggest improvement in the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> Next-Gen Update is the <strong>improved framerate</strong>. Previous generation consoles <strong>struggled to run the game at 30 FPS</strong>, and with massive drops in cities and with some weather conditions, such as rain, it was difficult for most not only to get immersed in the game's setting but also to just enjoy an adventure that still deserved to be played, despite its issues.</p>



<p>All of the issues found in the original have been addressed in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Released last year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, <strong>Henry of Skalitz's second adventure is a memorable one, by all accounts</strong>. "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original,"</em> wrote Chris Wray in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10/10 review.</a></strong></p>

<p>What immediately jumps out to tech-savvy gamers are the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM requirements</strong>. According to the specs above, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> will <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">require 16 GB of RAM</strong> to run even at the lowest settings, which is somewhat surprising considering the systems the two included games were released for.</p>



<p>The original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, which is among the most complex PS3 games ever released, ran on the measly <strong>256 MB</strong> of the system. This shows how much <strong>game development and thus technical requirements have changed since 2008.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</em> are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not the only games</strong> included in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em>. Included as a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Collection Edition bonus</strong> will be <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">METAL GEAR Ghost Babel</strong></em>, the first handheld entry in the series launched in 2000 on Game Boy Color which features a slightly modernized take of the gameplay formula of Metal Gear 2. A worthy play for any fan of the series, which has finally returned to the spotlight following its <strong>long absence.</strong></p>

            <guid>1435408</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's a new game bundle on <strong>Steam</strong> that lets you pick up what are arguably two of the best RPGs in the last few years on one discount. Developers <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> and <strong>ATLUS</strong> have joined together to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">form a bundle</a> including both <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> and <strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong>. Both games are currently on sale separately, but you can grab them together in a bundle for <strong>10%</strong> off their combined price, and it's a bundle that both sides are proud to be a part of.</p>



<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio creative director and writer <strong>Katsura Hashino</strong> said that he was "<em>very pleased</em>" to know that Metaphor would be put together with Expedition 33, a game that he had his own personal high level of praise for.</p>



<p>"<em>I am very pleased to hear that a Steam bundle will be released with&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em>, a title that has received high praise around the world," Hashino said in a press release. "<em></em><em>Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is a work that <strong>conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre</strong>, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, <strong>I found it to be truly inspiring</strong>."</p>



<p>"<em>I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches</em>," Hashino continued. "<em>While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, <strong>players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre</strong>. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer</em>."</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated how significant this kind of praise is from such a legend of the JRPG genre. <strong>Persona</strong> fans will know Hashino's work well, as he's been one of ATLUS' key creatives behind <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> and Persona for many years.</p>



<p>For Sandfall Interactive's part, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 creative director and Sandfall's chief executive officer, <strong>Guillaume Broche</strong>, had his own reverie towards ATLUS, Metaphor: ReFantazio and the work that Hashino and his team have accomplished over the years, citing them as inspirations for his love of JRPGs.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;is a game that is really inspiring for us," Broche said. "<em>It tells a beautiful story in a completely new world that is masterfully crafted. It deals with heavy themes but one that resonates strongly with me is the </em><strong><em>importance of imagination in all aspects of our lives</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>"<em>The cast is lovable and the turn-based battle system is one of the best I have played. The re-imagination of the traditional jobs system through Archetypes is fantastic and opens up so many playstyles that are fun to play around with. On top of that, the game has one of the most charismatic villains I've ever seen in an RPG</em>. <em><strong>It is a great honor to be able to collaborate with ATLUS on this bundle</strong>, as I have been a fan of their work since&nbsp;</em><em>Shin Megami Tensei™: Lucifer's Call&nbsp;</em>(also known as&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>&nbsp;for some players)."</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/">Wccftech's staff and community pick for Game of the Year in 2025</a>. We also gave it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong>9.5/10</strong> when we reviewed it at launch</a>, while Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">received a <strong>9/10</strong> from us</a> when we reviewed it in 2024.</p>



<p>Both are two of the best RPGs you can play right now, with this new Steam bundle being a great chance to pick up both if you're a fan of RPGs and JRPGs but have somehow not tried either of them yet.</p>
