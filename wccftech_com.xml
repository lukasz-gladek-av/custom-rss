			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>

<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>
