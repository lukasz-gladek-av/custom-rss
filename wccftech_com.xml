			<p>Today, <strong>Guerrilla Games</strong> has finally unveiled its upcoming online co-op action game: <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>. <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank">Announced over four years ago</a>, the game indeed features the&nbsp;<strong>stylized, slightly cartoonish look</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/" target="_blank">players got a glimpse of in early 2023 with the footage leak.</a>&nbsp;It'</span>s undoubtedly a big departure from the main series' trademark highly realistic visuals, and it remains to be seen whether it will resonate with fans. Visually, at least, the MMORPG <strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers</strong>, in development at NCSoft, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certainly looks more similar to the main games</a>.</p>



<p>Anyway, first and foremost, Guerrilla's Game Director <strong>Arjan Bak</strong> reassured fans that they're not going to stop making new single player Horizon games. However, the team wanted to try something different this time around.</p>



<p>In the game, players form the titular Gathering, an elite crew of hunters serving as the last line of defense against machines that grow more dangerous by the day. <strong>The narrative is fully canon</strong> within the Horizon universe, introducing new characters, threats, and mysteries that expand the world's lore beyond what we know from <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/horizon-zero-dawn-welcome-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Forbidden West</a></strong>, and the VR exclusive <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>The launch roster of Horizon Hunters Gathering will feature diverse hunter types</strong>, such as soldiers who hold the line, infiltrators who operate from the shadows, champions who shine in battle, mercenaries with checkered pasts, and veterans seeking one final mission. <strong>The very first small-scale closed playtest will take place at the end of this month</strong>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can sign up for it via the PlayStation Beta program</a>. This test build will include three hunters: <strong>Rem</strong>, <strong>Sun</strong>, and <strong>Axel</strong>, each offering distinct combat approaches, including classic roles such as tank, support, and tactician, and teamwork dynamics. Guerrilla plans to continue expanding the roster over time through post-launch content updates.</p>



<p>Unlike the single player games, Horizon Hunters Gathering <strong>has been designed for team-based encounters</strong>. As such, to succeed in combat, you'll need to read enemy movements, time your party's attacks, and coordinate squad abilities to defeat the most powerful machines. <strong>Guerrilla even introduced a roguelite build system</strong> that lets players collect perks, weapon upgrades, and stat enhancements after each machine encounter, encouraging experimentation with power-up combinations tailored to specific challenges.</p>

<p>At launch, Horizon Hunters Gathering will allow players to explore four large environments, each with unique atmospheres and squad challenges. The Hunter's Gathering serves as the central hub. It's a customizable campsite where teams upgrade gear, adjust loadouts, and prepare for expeditions before venturing into the wilds.</p>



<p>The first playtest includes two mission types designed around challenge and mastery:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Incursion</strong> tasks squads with repelling large-scale machine assaults on tribes, requiring coordination to collect randomized power-ups before confronting a relentless boss, all while a violent storm closes in. </li>



<li><strong>Cauldron Descent</strong> is a multi-stage dungeon where hunters take the offensive, choosing paths through brutal machine encounters and challenging obstacles that demand teamwork. Each cleared chamber provides power-ups that enable deeper descents and greater rewards.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The final game will include a story campaign</strong> that supports both solo play with NPCs and co-op with other players, but the narrative won't be available in the February playtest.</p>



<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering doesn't have a release date, but we know <strong>it will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression</strong> (provided you're using the same PlayStation account).</p>

			<p>Today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> </strong>event had a lot of announcements that were exciting for players who don't have any other console or device to play games on besides a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, because most of the biggest announcements were about games already available elsewhere coming to the Switch 2. Three of those bigger ports all came from <strong>Bethesda</strong>, as Bethesda Game Studios boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">Todd Howard</a></strong> appeared to reveal that <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> and <strong>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</strong> are all coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>



<p>Two out of three of those ports were already spoiled ahead of the show, <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/2019353936290079221">as the reliable leaker Billbil-kun</a> revealed that both Indiana Jones and Fallout 4 were destined for the hybrid console, hours before the Partner Showcase went live.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The first of the ports to arrive will be Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, which makes its way onto Nintendo Switch 2 later this month, on <strong>February 24, 2026.</strong> After that, it'll be Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's turn, arriving on the platform on <strong>May 12, 2026.</strong> Oblivion Remastered will be the last of the three ports to arrive, and it's the only one that doesn't have an exact release date yet. It just has a release window of "<em><strong>later this year</strong></em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>With the arrival of these ports, Nintendo Switch 2 players will be able to further round out their library of Bethesda-published and/or developed titles on the console, now that <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> already has a Switch 2 version available. The biggest game that Bethesda fans are seemingly missing any news on, at least for now, is the arrival of <strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong> on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>Other major announcements from today's Partner Showcase Direct include a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> on Switch 2,</a> which also carries further implications about when we'll get to see the first details for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3.</strong> For everything announced at the Partner Showcase, <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">check out our hub page with all of the announcements, and which games we expected to appear that didn't show up</a>.</p>
