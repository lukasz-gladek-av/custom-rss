			<p><strong>Ed Skrein</strong>, who you might recognize as the main antagonist in the first <strong>Deadpool</strong> movie or as the antagonist in Zack Snyder's ridiculous <strong>Rebel Moon</strong> films has been tapped by <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Productions </strong>to play <strong>Baldur</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>.</p>



<p>Skrein is the latest to join the cast, taking up one of the last major characters whose casting had yet to be revealed. We know who is playing <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Kratos</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/">Atreus</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Brok, Sindri, Mimir</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Thor</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Odin</a></strong>, and we now know who will be stepping into Baldur's numb feet.</p>



<p>Announced in a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-ed-skrein-baldur-1236671517/">Variety</a>, Baldur's casting just leaves <strong>Freya</strong> as the only major character for whom we don't know the casting. Skrein's involvement also keeps the trend of Alastair Duncan (Mimir) and Ryan Hurst (Kratos) as the only actors who were involved in <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and/or <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> that are also involved in this upcoming series. Alastair Duncan is also the only member of the cast to be reprising his role, since Hurst has gone from playing Thor in Ragnarok to playing Kratos in this live-action series.</p>



<p>The show is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming next month</a>, so we'll hopefully have confirmation of who will be stepping into the role of Freya soon. While the rest of the casting choices suggest we shouldn't be expecting <strong>Danielle Bisutti</strong> to be reprising her role, her performance in both games was excellent, and it would certainly go a long way with fans of the games to see her continue with the character she clearly knows so well.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a>:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>
