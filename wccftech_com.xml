			<p>Throughout 2025, rumors of Valve's upcoming projects have swirled with increasing intensity. We covered rumors that mentioned a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Steam Console project</a> based on AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, though the most persistent rumors were those focused on <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deckard</a>, the codename for Valve's new Virtual Reality headset, successor to the Index.</p>



<p>A couple of days ago, Bradley Lynch, a reliable leaker of the company's projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that we would get an announcement this week not only on Deckard (whose final name appears to be Steam Frame) but also on a new Steam controller. The Steam Frame is expected to feature the following specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</li>



<li>Display: 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</li>



<li>Features: SLAM tracking, eye tracking</li>
</ul>



<p>As for the controller, it will reportedly feature a 'capsense' feature to detect how far the user's fingers are from the gamepad's handles. </p>



<p>The announcements might land in a few hours. YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://x.com/mooreslawisdead/status/1988432610951852284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that Valve fans should prepare for the reveal to drop at around 19 UTC. But gamers are not-so-secretly hoping to learn about more than just new hardware. </p>



<p>Other rumors had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Valve was also hard at work on a new Half-Life project. Another leaker, Kurakasis, has <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1988309847046340713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gaben, do it 😈</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 is arguably a mythological figure in the games industry at this point. It's been twenty-one years since Half-Life 2, and although Half-Life Alyx was released in 2020 alongside the Valve Index VR headset, gamers would like a proper sequel to be available as a non-VR exclusive game.</p>



<p>Another leaker, Shpeshal Nick, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1988221134622630153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>If what I was just DMd is actually true (big if), next week GTA 6 could actually have its thunder stolen on the hype scale</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 could certainly steal a bit of attention away from GTA VI, at least for hardcore gamers (certainly not for the mainstream). It doesn't perfectly align with the other teasers, which all indicate an announcement coming later today. Then again, his sources might have been incorrect regarding the timeline. </p>



<p>Anyway, we should learn more about what's coming from Valve very soon. Sit tight.</p>
