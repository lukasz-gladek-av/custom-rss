            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in 2020, Malaysian game development studio Metronomik released <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-release-august-25/">No Straight Roads</a>, an action-adventure game deeply rooted in music coming with a distinct visual style, and some great boss battles that made it easy to look past the general simplicity of the entire experience. After releasing the Encore Edition featuring additional content, the development studio started working on No Straight Roads 2, a sequel that promises to significantly expand every one of its predecessor's features, from music to gameplay.</p>



<p>During last month's Gamescom, I had the opportunity to meet with Metronomik co-founder and Game Director Wan Hazmer and Business Development Manager Rie Matsuura to talk about the second entry in their series. Much like in 2019, when I met him during the very last <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-hands-on-preview/">E3 in Los Angeles</a> to to talk about the original, Wan Hazmer was very enthusiasiastic about the project, and I feel he had every right to be, as No Straight Roads 2 immediately felt like a massive step up over its predecessor, which did a lot of things right, but whose relatively small scope ultimately impacted the experience negatively.</p>



<p>With No Straight Roads 2, Metronomik is not taking any chances. Bunk Bed Junction is not only heading out of Vinyl City for the first time, but they are also expanding the band, as keyboard player Casey and another yet-to-be-revealed band member will join guitarist Mayday and drummer Zuke. And, for the first time, they will feel like an actual band playing together, as all characters will actually participate in combat when not controlled by any player, fighting mobs and bosses together. The introduction of mobs is only one of the things made possible by Metronomik getting bigger as a game development studio, as the support from publisher Shueisha Games and the addition of more developers allowed the creation of a proper AI system for mobs and characters, but also the creation of much bigger stages that will address the extreme linearity of the original.</p>

<p>The unique combination of music and action gameplay of the original is also getting significantly expanded in No Straight Roads 2, as the new entry in the series will explore Jazz besides EDM. This new genre, which is considerably more complex than most modern music, will be explored in a rather unusual way, as the developer has injected a Malaysian flair into it, which is sure to make the experience rather unique. The addition of a more complex genre will also impact gameplay in some form, Wan Hazmer told me, although it was difficult to tell exactly how from the short demo playthrough I watched during the session. One thing this playthrough made sure of is how boss fights will once again be the highlight of the experience. The one featured in the demo did an excellent job showing how the gameplay complexity has increased, with mobs joining in the fight, and the music's intensity indicating when the boss is about to unleash a powerful attack. With some new cues indicating when an attack can be parried, perfect dodging, a stun mechanic that allows players to stun enemies if certain conditions are met, a combat arena that changes depending on how the battle is going, taking advantage of a green screen setup in a very clever way to offer some visual storytelling, it's clear how No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a more involving experience than its predecessor that will surprise the vast majority of players.</p>



<p>With Hi-Fi Rush in some way revolutionizing the action-rhythm game landscape, I expected No Straight Roads 2 to take more than a few pages from its book, but that is not precisely what Metronomik is doing with their game. While it is undeniable that Tango Gameworks' action title has influenced the game, Metronomik is focused on keeping its identity, using music differently and far less restrictively. Unlike Hi-Fi Rush, where the player is punished for doing things to the beat, No Straight Roads 2 provides incentives for doing so but with no downside if the player doesn't. This is not only a way to make the game more accessible and less restrictive, but also to implement more varied music. In Hi-Fi Rush, every song is rhytmically simple in a 4/4 beat, which makes it easy for players to follow even if they have no music education. With No Straight Roads 2 exploring different musical genres, this wouldn't have worked as well and would have proved to be even more restrictive and punishing. In terms of music, No Straight Roads 2 will also feature all original music, so licensing issues will not force the developer to alter their game down the line.</p>



<p>With so many improvements across the board, including multiplayer, No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a much better game than its predecessor. The little I have seen of the game being so interesting already, I cannot wait to see what else Metronomik has come up with, especially how the new bosses will top the already excellent bosses of the original and how the yet-to-be-revealed character will impact an experience that already looks to be tons of fun. Unfortunately, the wait may still be a little long, as No Straight Roads 2 is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC and yet-to-be-confirmed consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Relaxed Mode mod is now available for download, featuring plenty of QOL improvements that can make the game more enjoyable for those struggling with some of its elements, such as the high challenge level.</p>



<p>The mod, which has been developed by didrio and can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/92?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, features a selection of balance and quality-of-life enhancements that can be fully configured, allowing users to only use some of the features the mod offers. Among these are balance changes with all damage reduced to 1 mask, Rosary Beads and Shards multipliers, healing changes, Swift Step and Clawline no longer consuming silk, health bars for enemies and bosses, increased iframes after receiving damage, and more. Although some of these changes undoubtedly make Hollow Knight: Silksong a little easier, the vast majority of them make for a more enjoyable experience, especially for those who never played the first entry in the series and were unprepared for the high level of challenge the new game shows right from the beginning.</p>



<p>Team Cherry seems to be aware that Hollow Knight: Silksong presents a high challenge level right from the beginning, and has confirmed that some balance changes will be included in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-first-patch-makes-early-game-easier/">first patch</a>. Specifically, the patch will reduce the difficulty of early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter, reduce damage from Sandcarvers, reduce mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices and more. Personally, I didn't find the two bosses mentioned by Team Cherry to be particularly challenging, but I can definitely see how they can be difficult to take down for players who aren't used to the sort of balancing that's more common in Soulslike games, rather than Metroidvania titles.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/road-kings-gamescom-2025-qa-hero-open-road/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/road-kings-gamescom-2025-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98you-are-the-hero-of-the-open-road%E2%80%99.1294524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment revealed Road Kings, the latest chapter in their successful series of racing simulation games after MudRunner, SnowRunner, Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, and Roadcraft.</p>



<p>Whereas most of the previous games focused on off-road driving, though, this one is squarely aimed at delivering the definitive trucking experience. Players will start out as rookie drivers behind the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South, from Jacksonville to Savannah. They will have to keep an eye on everything that real truck drivers do, from regulations to fuel, unpredictable weather, and much more. There's even going to be a narrative component that ties everything together, exposing the human element to the drivers and everyone involved in trucking.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to chat with Saber Interactive Porto Game Director Peter Mack and Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits about Road Kings, which is scheduled to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141130/Road_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X consoles (a Nintendo Switch 2 port is still under evaluation).</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Peter, which game did you work on before this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This is the first project I've worked on at Saber Porto. My experience before this was working with smaller LEGO games at another company, but I've now been with Saber Porto for many years.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so this is the first project you've been doing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> With Saber Porto, yes.</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working on this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This project started production around three years ago and was in pre-production for a year before that.</p>



<p><strong>Does this run on your proprietary engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> No, it's Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using any of the signature features, such as Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes, we're taking advantage of a lot of features that are now available.</p>



<p><strong>I don't know if you can share that, but is Road Kings also coming to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I would have to get back to you on that.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> We haven't quite decided that. Yeah, we're investigating it, but we're looking at our pipeline and stuff. One of the things to add to his answer about technology is that yes, it runs on Unreal, but we are leveraging the knowledge and experience that Saber has developed with Snowrunner, road crab, Mudrunner, you know, and any fantastic. We know vehicles. We know big vehicles, and we know trucks. You can really feel that it's solid, real, when driving. We have been praised for our realistic simulations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Saber has done many racing simulation projects about trucks and stuff like that. Where does Road Kings sit in this portfolio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I feel this is a spiritual successor to all of the simulation-centered titles that have come before it. It's inspired by them and it makes a very nice complement to Saber's other racing simulations.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Yep. Right in the middle! We are very proud of it. We've added that Saber spirit to it, where you are the hero of the open road. It is a true truck simulator, but you do so much more. You help people in need, you help communities in need...</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> It's very human.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> It's about trucks. At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</p>



<p><strong>You said there is a story in Road Kings. Can you talk a bit about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. As I was just saying, trucks are a huge part of society, so they are involved in a lot of very important things to a lot of people. We tried to create a story that touches on these facts and what we've learned by talking with truck drivers and understanding their lives. We tried to create a narrative that the player, as part of an immersive simulation, can engage with or not. If you like to just sort of work and drive for long-haul trips over the road, you can, but if you want to engage with a sort of narrative experience, you can do that, too.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Especially in America, where trucking is very important. The country is really big, and we don't have trains like in Europe, so the trucking culture in America is very unique. Tapping on what Peter said about that spirit and human factor, that is really important.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There are also all the changes that are happening in the industry right now. When we were doing research for Road Kings, we were reading about and speaking with people about their fears about the impact technology has on trucking. If you look at blogs lately, it's about autonomous trucks and when they are coming and what they are going to do to this very important aspect of society that has existed in the United States for hundreds of years, and how it's going to be affected. Along with that, there's the change in the technology of the trucks. There is a change going on in the climate and the increasingly unpredictable weather, which often affects drivers and puts them in danger. All these things are for us narrative components to bring into stories you encounter in the game..</p>



<p><strong>Can you share how long the story of Road Kings is going to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I understand it's topping out at about 10 hours of gaming, but that's pretty much if you sail right through and if you do story beat after story beat.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> I mean, it's a simulation game. You can play forever beyond the story.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There is also a layer of procedurally generated conditions and stories that you can encounter. For example, the dispatcher can call you up. Again, taken right from the pages of drivers, blogs, and diaries, they call you up and tell you that they made a mistake and the job you're doing is wrong, and can you do them a favour and take it to the other side of the state? And if you say yes, if it's convenient and makes sense, you get a reputation with the dispatcher, and if you say no, you get paid as normal. So, in addition to it being endless in terms of the simulation, there's even the sort of endless aspect to the small stories you can encounter.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The weather is dynamic, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Does it include icy conditions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Let us get up toward Missouri and we can talk about that, but right now you're in sort of north Florida to southern Georgia. So, we don't have snowstorms for now, but we're looking at it.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about the asynchronous multiplayer mode?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a leaderboard for the player-created companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Is it cross-platform? Can you invite a friend who plays the game on another platform?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Indeed!</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support Road Kings post-launch, with more content and features?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Absolutely. 100%. We already have a lot of content planned for after launch. We find that this game lends itself very easily and naturally to expansion, not just in terms of geography, but in terms of truck types and customizations. All is expandable post-launch, but we also see very easily that we can add more stories and more narratives and more dispatchers, and more companies. I think we have fifteen more companies already lined up to be considered.</p>



<p><strong>Would these be premium DLCs, or possibly some free DLCs, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I think we're looking at a plan that includes all of the above.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you both for your time.</strong></p>
