			<p>Two years ago, on September 21, 2023, Starbreeze Entertainment released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">Payday 3</a>, a game that might've pushed the series forward in terms of its approach to stealth gameplay and its visuals, but was an abysmal mess with <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-peaked-at-1-3-million-daily-users-starbreeze-apologizes-for-server-issues/">server issues</a>, no offline mode, and a massive lack of content compared to Payday 2. </p>



<p>Two years later, Starbreeze is <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1970046991779434606">celebrating the 14th anniversary of the Payday series</a>, though it's a muted celebration, as it's most recent release is far less popular than the game it made before. Looking at Steam concurrent numbers alone, Payday 2 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/">still has thousands of players</a> going on heists and enjoying the wealth of content available with its many DLCs. Payday 3, on the other hand, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/">struggles to hit 1k players</a> with any kind of consistency.</p>



<p>That's probably why, as part of today's anniversary celebrations, Starbreeze has introduced two noteworthy bits of news for Payday fans. Firstly, Payday 3 is getting an <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/09/new-skill-system-preview/">overhauled skill system</a> as Starbreeze continues to try to shape Payday 3 into a game that Payday fans want to play more than Payday 2.</p>



<p>Second, while everyone who still wants to play a Payday game is playing Payday 2, Starbreeze has introduced a new subscription for (almost) all the 65+ DLCs available for the heist shooter. It's not every DLC that's been released for Payday 2, because it doesn't include any DLC content that's been retired or removed.</p>



<p>It's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847540/PAYDAY_2_Subscription/">$5/month subscription</a> to access the many DLCs available for Payday 2, which Starbreeze says it has introduced because, "<em>Payday 2 has had a lot of DLCs released, and for many players, especially new ones, it can be difficult to know what DLC content you may be interested in. So weâ€™ve introduced the Subscription to give an easy way to access all DLC content at a low monthly price.</em>"</p>



<p>That might seem sensible and like a good deal on face value, even when considering that you will need to buy Payday 2 separately to access any of the content in the subscription. But that's before you realize that Payday 2's DLCs routinely go on sale, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/3756/">Legacy Collection</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/34119/#prices">Infamous Collection</a>, the latter of which includes every DLC ever released for Payday 2, going on sale a few times a year for anywhere between 20% and 30% off.</p>



<p>In fairness to Starbreeze, it's not the only studio trying something like this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/">Cities: Skylines</a> offers a similar service, as do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538960/Crusader_Kings_II__Expansion_Subscription/">Crusader Kings II</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_Classic_2024/">Train Simulator</a>, to name a few. But whether it'll actually help Starbreeze keep the lights on while it tries to fix Payday 3 is another question, and so far it doesn't seem to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nnssb4/wait_what_payday_2_subscription/">gone over too well with the Payday community</a>. </p>



<p>Not everything has to be a subscription you pay for monthly, and if you're really someone who wants to get into Payday, then you're much better off doing a bit of research as to which DLCs you'd maybe want to try, and waiting for everything to go on sale, because it will go on sale and ultimately be cheaper than having $5 chipped off your bank account for months on end.</p>

			<p>Right before the beginning of this year's Tokyo Game Show, PlayStation State of Play returns tomorrow with over 30 minutes of updates on announced games and brand new reveals.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">confirmed on the Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the presentation will air tomorrow, September 24, at 2 pm PT / 5 pm ET / 11 pm CEST on &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>. During its 35 minutes of duration, the presentation will provide updates and reveals from developers around the world with new looks at anticipated third-party titles, indie titles. The presentation will also feature updates from some PlayStation Studios' developers, including an extended look at Saros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">the new game from Housemarque launching next year</a>.</p>



<p>In the past few years, a PlayStation Showcase or State of Play presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-confirmed-to-air-tomorrow-showing-20-games/">took place right before the beginning of the annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">rumors suggesting that 2025 wouldn't have been different</a>, today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">June 2025 PlayStation State of Play presentation was filled with a lot of great reveals</a>, such as Romeo is A Dead Man, the next game from Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture which is setting out to be another great action game with some peculiar vibes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">judging from the time I spent with the game during Gamescom</a>, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, whose new features such quality-of-life enhancements and voice acting will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gamescom-hands-on-preview-definitive-edition-in-the-making/">elevate an already great tactical role-playing game</a>, and MARVEL TOKON: Fighting Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">a new fighting game starring Marvel Comics characters from genre masters Arc System Works</a>, so there's a very good chance the new presentation will feature some nice surprise reveals alongside the announced new look at Saros and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/">rumored proper first look at Insomianc's Wolverine.</a></p>
