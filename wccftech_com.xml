			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly be revealed this week with a trailer that will focus on the hardware, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed that the next-generation Nintendo system will be revealed this Thursday, January 16th, with a trailer that will focus on the hardware. To see the games, however, we will have to wait a few more weeks, as a software presentation is reportedly scheduled for February or March. Unfortunately, there's the chance that we may not learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch or how much it will cost in a few days, as the leaker is not sure this information will be included in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>As for the launch lineup, Nate the Hate doesn't possess any concrete info, and the discussion is mostly based on speculation. One thing that could get confirmed, on the other hand, is the massive support from third-party developers the Nintendo Switch 2 will see. Square Enix, for example, will supposedly port Final Fantasy VII Remake this year and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in 2026. Ubisoft also seems to be betting a lot on the console, as ports of Assassin's Creed Mirage and Assassin's Creed Shadows are in the works, and the publisher is also looking into porting more titles. According to French News TV Channel <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/switch-2-assassin-s-creed-mirage-et-shadows-sortiront-sur-la-prochaine-console-de-nintendo_AV-202501140567.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BFM TV</a>, these ports are real, are not being developed by the original studios, are ambitious, and will take advantage of the console's power. The Shadows port, however, will not be released until the end of the year to polish the experience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Square Enix and Ubisoft aren't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">third-party developers and publishers</a> that will support the Nintendo Switch 2. According to Nate the Hate, Konami is working on a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater port, which could release day and date on the Nintendo console. The insider also heard rumblings of an Elden Ring port, but couldn't say for sure if it is indeed happening or not. Still, it seems like third-party developers are eager to port their games to the console, which wasn't exactly the case with the original Switch, which started seeing some high-profile ports only some time after the system launched.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but thankfully, the wait could be almost over. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
