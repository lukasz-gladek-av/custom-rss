			<p>The PlayStation 6 is expected to feature more RAM than the 16 GB RAM of the PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro, but the tech experts at Digital Foundry don't think the next-generation system will have much more RAM than the current systems for several reasons.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the known tech-experts commented on how much RAM the next-generation systems should be expected to have, starting with the PlayStation 6. Given what already can be achieved with 16 GB and how we are already hitting limits in regards to textures and art assets, 24 GB of RAM sounds reasonable, as the extra RAM over the current systems will be needed for machine learning and the more advanced ray tracing that's already been teased as part of the future of PlayStation. Additionally, the cost of DRAM is high and hasn't seen any significant drop in the past few years, so this will undoubtedly be a limiting factor. Also, if the rumored PlayStation handheld is real, it will likely come with 16 GB of RAM, making 24 GB RAM a more sensible choice for the home system if developers are supposed to target both systems with their games.</p>



<p>With the next Xbox, however, predictions are a little harder to make, as Microsoft may decide to go in a different direction and not compete directly with the PlayStation 6 with their next-gen system, but with pre-built PCs. As such, a premium system could easily have a bigger APU and more RAM than Sony's system. According to Digital Foundry, studies were done at Microsoft some time ago looking into the possibility of launching a "PC-in-a-box" rather than a lead console, highlighting how costs escalated dramatically, making such a system not an enticing option in the console space. In the pre-built PCs space, however, there's a price gap between the cheapest systems and consoles that such a system could fill, so the possibility is definitely there to launch a "PC-in-a-box" with better specs than Sony's next-gen system.</p>

<p>Though Sony is expected to launch a PlayStation 6 in the next few years, it will be much more interesting to see if the rumored PlayStation handheld is launching alongside the traditional home console. This system is said to be able to run<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/"> PlayStation 5 games natively</a> and will be more powerful than the<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> Xbox Series S.</a></p>
