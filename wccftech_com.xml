			<p>Turkish independent developer Motion Blur immediately caught our attention when they first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off</a> their upcoming Black State project last Summer. The third-person shooter puts a lot of emphasis on stealth and seems clearly inspired by KONAMI's legendary series Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Black State was demonstrated once again at the recent CES 2025 in Las Vegas, where IGN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeHqPHRAWR0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed</a> around three and a half minutes of new footage in 4K resolution, and it looks glorious. The level of photorealism is incredible, especially for an indie studio. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but interestingly, it won't leverage the built-in Lume and Nanite features as nearly all UE5 games do. Motion Blur has instead developed a 'special pipeline after a long R&amp;D process', which they promise will provide outstanding visuals and unbelievable optimization.</p>

<p>Black State is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as one of the games that will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which will allow for optimal performance on the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>
<p>In the game, the main character is summoned by a secret group of scientists called the Architects for a mysterious mission to save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. Players will be able to seamlessly move between levels without any loading screens. Motion Blur said these real-time transitions lead to different adventures, ensuring players never know which door opens to where, adding an element of thrill and danger.</p>
<p>Players will have a vast array of weapons and tactical gadgets at their disposal to succeed in a series of intense combat scenarios and stealth sequences, including guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns) and unique explosive devices. Just like in Metal Gear Solid, there will be close-quarter combat as well, with over a hundred cinematic kill moves implemented in the game. Players must be very careful, though, as they will face both elite human tactical forces and relentless robot-like killing machines. To top it all, Black State also includes several boss battles featuring unique patterns and mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>Black State doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know when it does.</p>

			<p>If you were hoping to find more gore when playing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, it might be interesting to know that the game was originally going to feature much more of that. The systems were in place, at least, according to former Bethesda Game Studios Character Artist Dennis Mejillones. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel KIWI TALKZ</a>, he explained the motive behind the cut was two-fold: technical and thematic.</p>
<p><em>The level of gore has a lot of implications with the different suits. From a technical perspective, there's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off and you got to meet caps to the bottom where the flesh is. We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses </em><em>on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. In Starfield, you can change your body size significantly. You</em><em> know, the character creator had evolved quite a bit, so I think that was part of it. The other thing is, like, Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's meant to be part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk, splatter mess, where you can make a mess out of something and it just blow up into goo? It's part of the fun. It's like those old-school animes, like Fist of the North Star; they punch each other, and gushes of blood come out. Nobody can hold that much blood, but you're like, that's cool. It adds to that style.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Starfield was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things, The Expanse, Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think it just didn't fit thematically, and on top of that, you have the technical overhead cost to get that to work. So, we were kind of like, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>probably better not to include it in this game.</em></p>
<p>In the lengthy interview, Mejillones also shared his profound admiration for Todd Howard, whom he regards as a mentor. As for Starfield gore, if you're looking to add that kind of spice to your playthrough on PC, there's a neat new mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorefield</a> that was just updated today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Data mining may have leaked the Nintendo Switch 2's computing power in teraflops. <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3950#post-1544590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Famiboards user Zachy</a>, the undocked or handheld mode will have a GPU clock speed of 561 MHz, translating into 1.71 TFLOPS. In docked mode, the GPU clock speed nearly doubles at 1000 Mhz, translating to around 3.1 TFLOPS.</p>
<p>That's one-fourth of the 12 TFLOPS of the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which launched in 2021. However, the RTX 3060 is a desktop GPU, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A better comparison is Microsoft's Xbox Series S console. It has been said that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and indeed, the leaked TFLOPS data supports that theory since the Series S has 4 TFLOPS of computing power. That's not a big difference, though, and third-party game developers will undoubtedly use their Xbox Series S configurations as starting targets for their ports to the new Nintendo console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra 239 SoC&nbsp;</a>(featuring an eight-core CPU and an Ampere-based GPU with 2048 CUDA cores), does have an advantage over the Xbox Series S: its reported native support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction technology. While the latter may not prove to be very useful as developers wouldn't want to spend the meager GPU power on ray tracing effects, DLSS SR will indeed be invaluable to uplift the performance to acceptable standards.</p>
<p>New leaks and rumors about the new Nintendo console pop up nearly daily at this point. The Japanese game developer and console manufacturer has promised it will unveil the hardware (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to include backward compatibility with existing Switch games, providing immediate access to a very large library) before the end of March, which is when Nintendo's fiscal year ends.</p>
