			<p>Silent Hill f officially arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past September 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">and according to Konami, by Sept. 26, 2025</a>, the latest entry in the Silent Hill franchise and the first one to make several big changes such as setting the game in Japan and not in the US for the first time, hit one million copies sold.</p>



<p>One million copies sold in one day is a huge milestone for what is the first new Silent Hill game in years and a continuation of the momentum that Konami was able to kickstart with the help of Bloober Team delivering above and beyond what players expected in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>



<p>It took the Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">a week to hit one million copies sold</a>. Konami could have had no better endorsement in the return of its beloved horror series than to see the first brand-new entry hit the same sales milestones as a nostalgia-charged remake six days faster.</p>



<p>"<em>The remake of Silent Hill 2 released last year, surpassed one million units shipped worldwide within a week of its release, but Silent Hill f is growing in shipments at an even faster pace in each</em> <em>region, including Japan</em>," Konami writes in its announcement of the sales milestone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's good to see one of the videogame industry's most influential series make such a strong return with its last two entries, but more particularly with Silent Hill f simply because it's the first brand-new game because of how many big swings and risks it takes to change things up.</p>



<p>In our review of Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubiñas, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>
