			<p>It's been just a little over seven years since <strong>Epic</strong> threw the gauntlet at <strong>Valve</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching its <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> as a direct competitor to the <strong>Steam</strong> platform</a> on PC. Right away, Epic tried to lure the game development community with a far more appealing revenue share split (88%-12% in favor of the developers, versus Steam's 70%-30%) and fans with a combination of exclusive games (which are more or less gone now, except for rare exceptions), free games and discounts (those <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are still very much happening</a>), and more.</p>



<p>At the end of 2025, we can safely say that Epic's massive efforts and expenses successfully carved a sizable user base for itself. Earlier this year, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the community had grown to host <strong>more than 295 million users</strong> in total. However, it did not impact Steam in the least; Valve's platform has continued to grow at an impressive pace, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent users</strong> two months ago</a>. That's users who were online at the same time, a figure that can be verified independently thanks to the existence of SteamDB. The same cannot be done with the EGS, but it is believed to be far lower. </p>



<p>Besides mere figures, though, core gamers still tend to be quite dismissive of Epic's Store, whereas they are really fond and protective of Steam, perhaps at times even more than they ought to be. Why? This specific question was answered by <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>. <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/epic-fails-to-compete-with-steam-because-egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-community-says-witchfire-lead-as-epic-has-nothing-to-do-but-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with FRVR</a>, he claimed that Valve's Steam feels more like a home thanks to its feature set, whereas the EGS is still merely a shop:</p>



<p><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop.</em></p>



<p><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community. There’s actually so much happening in that community hub for every single game, much more than I ever imagined, and it’s no wonder that people sort of get invested emotionally in Steam. And then they feel like, ‘Okay, my home is here, so my personal library is here’. So when something is released exclusively to Epic, something they want to play, then it’s a problem for them because now I’m gonna [have to] cheat on my home library with some other shop.</em></p>



<p>It's a fair explanation. While Epic has improved its store over time, introducing the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifting feature for Black Friday 2025</a> and, a few days ago, a cross-platform text chat, it still lacks the community features mentioned by Chmielarz. Overall, Epic's improvements to its platform have been too slow to catch up with Steam, especially since Valve hasn't rested on its laurels and continues to refine its own ecosystem. </p>



<p>It should be noted that The Astronauts actually did take the timed Epic Games Store exclusivity deal for Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as discussed in a previous exclusive interview with Wccftech</a>. The game eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a year later on Steam</a>. In the FRVR interview, Chmielarz stated that the company was running out of money, making the deal vital to keep the company independent. Ultimately, he claims everyone got what they wanted: Epic got an exclusive game for a year, The Astronauts got the money to keep afloat, and the Steam community got a more polished game, albeit a bit later.</p>

			<p>You may or may not remember, back when Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King were trying to get the acquisition across the finish line, Microsoft signed deals with the two other major console platform makers to continue (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or in one case, to start</a>) releasing Call of Duty games on that platform. Microsoft and Nintendo's deal was a 10-year commitment, and while no one really expected a Call of Duty game to come to the Nintendo Switch, it seemed like we could expect the shooter franchise to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Well, we're two years into that 10-year commitment, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is no longer a poorly kept secret but the latest console on the market. So, where is Call of Duty on the Nintendo Switch 2? According to Jez Corden at Windows Central, it's just around the corner and into the new year.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">X (formerly Twitter)</a> regarding the series' arrival on Switch, Corden replied, "<em>The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Another user quoted the above reply from Corden, asking for further clarification, and if the arrival of Call of Duty on Switch could be counted as "<em>close</em>," to which Corden said, "<em>I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Now, Corden has been right in the past when it comes to rumours regarding Microsoft properties, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be cautious of his claim. We do at least know that Microsoft has to make good on its promise; the question of when and how is what is left in the balance. To be fair, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did say it would take some time</a> to get the technology ready for the port. </p>



<p>Still, we don't know if Activision would aim to put Call of Duty on the first-generation Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, which, if that is the case, would almost definitely limit the scope of the version Activision is trying to create for the hybrid handhelds. Perhaps in that scenario, it's Call of Duty: Warzone, not a mainline release, that arrives on the platform.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps Warzone hits both the Switch and Switch 2, while the latest mainline entry, Black Ops 7, arrives on the Switch 2 to take advantage of the extra hardware capabilities on the new device. Or, while Warzone makes it on to the Switch and Switch 2, the next mainline Call of Duty game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2027-introduce-new-sub-series-says-leaker/">not the new sub-series said to be coming in 2027</a>, but whatever 2026's Call of Duty will be), is the one to arrive on Switch 2.</p>



<p>Or none of that, with Nintendo and Activision taking what is arguably the weirdest route, but one that would harken back to the days when games for handheld consoles were made as somewhat changed, or sometimes entirely changed, experiences compared to their home-console contemporaries: a completely brand-new Call of Duty game that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 and isn't just a port of the other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, according to Corden, we won't have to speculate much longer.</p>
