			<p>Epic Games president and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney discussed Unreal Engine 6 for the first time (alongside several other topics) in a massive interview featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Lex Friedman podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney said that the next big iteration of the Unreal Engine technology will unify the parallel development threads that Epic is currently working on. The goal is to get the first UE6 previews out to developers in two to three years.</p>
<p><em>We have these two different tendrils of progress. There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers, and there's Unreal Engine 5 targeting the Fortnite community. And there's different bits of development that are only in one area that aren't applied to both. Not all the Unreal Engine 5 features are actually available in Fortnite, because some of them we haven't figured out or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them to all seven platforms in a platform-independent way. </em></p>
<p><em>The place where all of these different threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.&nbsp; </em><em>And it's a few years away. We don't have an exact timeframe, but we could be seeing preview versions of it perhaps two to three years from now. We're making continuous progress towards it.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Epic president admits that the technology is currently being hindered by the company's decision to stick with single-threaded simulations. That choice was made to simplify things not only for Epic itself but also for all game developers, but it is a limitation that Sweeney plans to overcome with Unreal Engine 6, which should finally fully embrace multithreading.</p>
<p><em>The biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation on Unreal Engine. We run a single-threaded simulation. If you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running the rest of the complicated game logic because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming, and we didn't want to</em><br>
<em>burden either ourselves, our partners, or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</em></p>
<p><em>Over time, that becomes an increasing limitation, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and that being Unreal Engine 6, that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine and get those on a better foundation that the modern world deserves, given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that timeframe.</em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the source of most, if not all, the CPU-related issues we've seen with Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It's great to hear Epic is finally going to address it, though it'll be a long while before we see Unreal Engine 6 in any game. As a reminder, the first UE5 preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-preview-updated-to-allow-for-even-bigger-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in early 2022</a>, while the first games that took advantage of the new technology didn't appear on the market until mid-to-late 2023: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layers of Fear remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a>, to name a few. As such, we might have to wait until late 2028/2029 to play the initial batch of Unreal Engine 6 games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Selling 2x As Fast as Any Other JRPG on Steam, Proving Square Enix Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong.1180659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been a great success, given that developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it's already a million seller (despite being available on Game Pass, too). How does it compare to other JRPGs, though?</p>
<p>According to our analyst friend Rhys Elliott, who was often <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously featured in exclusive interviews on Wccftech</a>, it's selling much faster, at least on Steam. Elliott, who recently left MIDiA Research to become Head of Market Analysis at Alinea Analytics, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-more-than-twice-as-fast-as-other-jrpgs-on-pc-analyst-says-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the game's surprising early sales compared to triple-A games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a certified hit, officially selling more than one million copies. The announcement didn't say players reached – it said copies sold. That was a choice, and I applaud the transparency. It's worth noting that two of these are ports, but the data still speaks volumes for how much gamers are drawn to Expedition 33. The low price point likely also factored in, as our Steam data shows that many players bite the bullet when an AAA game goes on sale and drops below $50.</em></p>

<p>The same doesn't quite apply to PlayStation sales, where Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold four times faster at launch. However, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is still ahead of the rest of the pack. Besides, losing to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PlayStation isn't surprising, given the enormous hype surrounding that game ahead of its launch last year.</p>

<p>In the interview mentioned above, Elliott also pointed to the fact that several JRPG fans were waiting for such a realistic JRPG, even with its turn-based combat, in contrast to Square Enix's public statements on the matter:</p>
<p><em>There was also an opening for a modern, realistic-looking JRPG. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has given RPG fans something they always wanted. If you asked Final Fantasy fans from the late '90s/early '00s what the ideal version of a JRPG should look like, it'd be something like this.</em></p>
<p>The reference is quite obvious. Back in June 2022, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it is getting harder to mix turn-based combat and realistic graphics because they create a feeling of idiosyncrasy among some players. Indeed, that game focused strictly on action-based combat, shunning the series' traditional turn-based system.</p>
<p>While I personally don't fully disagree with Yoshida's assessment, there is definitely still space for turn-based combat, especially if it is revamped with key innovations such as in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features real-time dodges and parries.</p>
<p>Besides, this particular game is just too good at almost everything it does, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's 9.5/10 review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was a strong remaster, not just because it was a great Unreal Engine 5 upgrade for a decade-old game, but because it included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for fans to solve, with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-subway-escape-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858%3Fl%3Denglish&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=49867ab213c4ee089d653e284f7a2968&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">16 of those puzzles</a> being made by fans who collaborated with Croteam on the expansion. So it's no surprise that these are some of the most difficult puzzles to solve in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through how to solve the Castle puzzle in the expansion, one of the more complicated puzzles. If you don't want the whole solution, and just want a hint, then the best hint I can give is that you need to make lasers fly.</p>
<p>If you want the full solution, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Castle Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Gather all the pieces</h3>
<p>When you enter the Castle puzzle area, you'll notice that the tetromino is on an elevated platform that you can only reach by a fan directly underneath it, and that you'll need to get both a red and blue laser to the nodes on either side of this elevated platform to reach the tetromino.</p>
<p>To do that, you first need all the pieces you'll need. Basically, this puzzle is one part gather the pieces, the other part execution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start by grabbing the fan off the vent below where you fly up to the tetromino, and place the fan on the pressure switch directly in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;With the fan on the pressure switch, you'll be able to reach the first connector (C1). Connect it to the red node and red laser generator that you can see through the window, and the red node on the wall behind you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan from the pressure switch, and use the fan that's activated to fly yourself (with the first fan in hand) over the gate and into the walled-off area with a deactivated fan vent and a second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan on the vent to activate it, grab the connector and use it to get back across to the other room, without having to pass through the purple forcefield between them.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring C2 into the main puzzle area, and grab the fan you used to fly yourself over the gate the first time, and place it on the first pressure switch you activated. Now you're free to grab C1 and carry it to the center puzzle area, so that you have two connectors and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator that's on the left side of the puzzle area, and place it down on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area. Connect it to the red node in the room on the right side of the puzzle area to clear the path to a box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the box and bring it to the center puzzle area.&nbsp;Place the box on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area (removing the fan first) and using C1, connect it to the blue laser generator on the right side of the puzzle area and the blue node on the left side of the puzzle area. Place C1 on top of the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, and the red node that's hidden behind the shield you're deactivating with the blue lasers to release the third connector (C3). Bring the third connector into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you nearly have all the components you need. All that's left is the box stuck behind a shield on the right side of the center puzzle area, with a red and blue node on either side to deactivate it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Take the box off the pressure switch, and replace it with C1. Connect C1 to the red laser generator.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the blue laser generator, and the blue node in the center puzzle area on the right side.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the other side of the shield. Place C3 on top of the box, making sure the box is somewhere that you can angle C3 to hit C1 and the red node.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>If you've done it correctly, your laser layout will look something like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the second box and bring it to the center puzzle area. You should now have two boxes, three connectors, and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Make the lasers fly</h3>
<p>Now you have all the components, you're ready to make the lasers fly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one box, head up the stairs on the right side of the center puzzle area and place it in front of the fan underneath the blue node. Do the same with the other box on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1, and connect it to the blue laser generator, the blue node above the box, and the blue node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on top of the box under the blue node when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the room. Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the blue laser generator. Make sure the angles are set, and when you place C3 down, you should see the box and C1 on top of it flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node above the box, and the red node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on the box when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick the fan back up, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area. Grab C3 and connect it to C2 and the red laser generator. Again, ensuring the angels are right, when you place C3 down, the box and C2 should be flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now you can pick up the fan, and place it down on the vent just below the elevated platform where the tetromino is.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fly up to where the tetromino is, and the shield will be deactivated, letting you grab the tetromino to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's how you solve the Castle puzzle in The Talos Principle: Reawakened's new In the Beginning expansion. A few of the steps can be done differently, but it all leads to the same final shape. At least, I think it does. Let me know if you figured out a different solution.</p>
