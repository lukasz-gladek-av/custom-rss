			<p>Developer Team Cherry has announced that it will host a "<em>Special Announcement</em>" for Hollow Knight Silksong this coming Thursday, August 21, 2025, at 7:30am PT / 10:30am ET / 3:30pm BST. It's the first official word from Team Cherry on its highly anticipated title in what feels like forever, and it is likely when we'll learn about the game's release date, if we don't hear about it today during Gamescom ONL 2025, that is.</p>



<p>"<em>The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!," </em>the description of the video, which is set to premiere on YouTube, reads. The studio shared the same message on <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, so for now it seems like that's all we'll get from them until Thursday.</p>

<p>We've known that Silksong would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">playable at Gamescom 2025</a> for a while now, and with its marketing ties to Xbox and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there's been a lot of speculation that when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">officially learn the release date</a> for the new Xbox handheld, we'll also learn the release date for Silksong.</p>



<p>That could still be true, and with the ROG Xbox Ally release date likely going live during Gamescom ONL 2025, Silksong's release date could be part of the ONL news cycle, with this presentation later in the week being a deep-dive into gameplay. At least, that would be the case, if not for Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claiming that the release date is being saved for the Thursday presentation.</p>







<p>We'll see how it all shakes out by the end of today, and if Silksong makes an appearance during the ONL presentation. What's certain, is that we are in the final stretch for Silksong. The wait is almost over, and we'll soon have a lot more official news on the title than we've had in the years since it was first announced. </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/">Delta Force</a> is officially out now for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, after the release date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-august-season-break-update-arrives-in-july/">confirmed this past June</a>. As part of the console launch celebration, developer Team Jade has debuted a suite of console-exclusive rewards for players jumping in on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

<p>Delta Force arrives with full crossplay support between consoles and PC, though you can opt out of crossplay if you'd rather not play against PC players. </p>



<p>The shooter runs at 60 FPS on both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S devices, though PS5 Pro players will be able to enjoy the game at unspecified higher frame rates later this year through a forthcoming patch. If you want to get a taste of a higher frame rate for Delta Force on your PS5 Pro now though, a press release for the news recommends you disable vertical sync to unlock the game's frame rate.</p>

<p>Along with the main multiplayer Warfare and Operations game modes, players will also be able to dive into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-campaign-to-launch-on-february-21/">recently launched</a> Black Hawk Down campaign mode as free DLC for Delta Force.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto played the campaign earlier this year in a hands-on preview</a> ahead of its release, he called it "<em>a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that theyâ€™re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package.</em>"</p>



<p>Now players on consoles can experience the campaign, and everything else Delta Force has to offer alongside PC players.</p>
