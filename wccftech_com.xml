            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed by Official Website]]></title>

			<p>Yesterday, renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> details on the Battlefield 6 release date. According to the insider, the game would be released on October 10, priced at €69.99/79.99 for the Standard Edition and €99.99/109.99 for the Phantom Edition, with the PC version being €10 cheaper as with most games.</p>



<p>Today, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut trailer</a> and the news that the reveal event would take place on July 31, eagle-eyed spotter Wario64 has already <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1948404850288427225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> some fine print on the official Battlefield 6 website that practically confirms the aforementioned release date as correct.</p>



<p>On the legal disclaimers, it is confirmed that pre-order offers will expire on October 10, which makes perfect sense if that's the game's release date. Moreover, the codes can be redeemed for two years through October 10, 2027, as with most games. If rumors are to be believed, fans should get their hands on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta test</a> much earlier than that, though, possibly in early August.</p>



<p>As to the game itself, the developers did not reveal much today, except that the bad guys are the so-called Pax Armata, a private military corporation 'bankrolled by former NATO states' whose agenda threatens to plunge the world into global conflict. This sets the stage for what players can expect on the battlefield, in both multiplayer and the series's return to a single-player campaign, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being handled by Motive Studios</a>. </p>



<p>The press release also confirms a veritable return to the core tenets of the franchise in Battlefield 6: visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom. Players will be able to blow through walls, bring down entire buildings, and take to the skies in dogfights for a tactical advantage, but working together with your squad will still be the secret to victory.</p>



<p>Next week, all will be revealed through a series of live events taking place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London, with another scheduled in Singapore on August 2. We'll have Kai on the ground in LA to report his first impressions on the long-awaited next chapter in the Battlefield series. Stay tuned for his hands-on!</p>

			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>
