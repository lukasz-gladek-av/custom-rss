			<p>Renowned AMD leaker KeplerL2 has revealed in a series of posts on the NeoGaf board (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mgijwx/keplerl2_xbox_xs_hardware_has_sold_less_than_30/?share_id=Ch1EvdKxiKZjo7CR5NGHO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>) that the Xbox Series S and X consoles have sold less than 30 million units, according to his estimates based on AMD sales data.</p>



<p><em>They aren't even at 30 million. You don't need third party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales. Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console; Van Gogh and all its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles. Z1/Z2 are repurposed laptop chips (Rembrandt/Phoenix/Strix) and fall under the Client segment.</em></p>



<p><em>It is also important to note that AMD's number is higher than what Sony/Xbox would count as unit sales since it includes chips sold but still in-flight (i.e., being assembled somewhere).<br>So Q3 &lt;100 million console units with ~66 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck would put Xbox Series S and X at a maximum of 29 million. Q4 &gt;100 million console units with ~75 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck means Xbox sold a minimum of 21 million units. So, Xbox sales for this gen range from a minimum of 21 million + Q1/Q2 2025 unit sales to a maximum of 29 million + Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025.</em></p>



<p>This means Sony's PlayStation 5 could have around three times the install base of Microsoft's Xbox duo. The choice to create a lower priced model, the Series S, was not nearly enough to stop the constantly dwindling sales. Even in the last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otherwise profitable quarter</a>, Xbox hardware sales decreased 22% on a year-over-year basis.</p>



<p>At least the Xbox Series S and X are not sold at a loss anymore, according to KeplerL2, unlike Sony's PlayStation 5:</p>



<p><em>PS5 had a brief period of being even/profitable, but then component prices went up (N7 wafers, GDDR6, and a few others), and it went right back to losing money. As far as I know, the regular PS5 is still sold at a minor loss; only the PS5 Pro is profitable. They did a die shrink for the Series X and raised prices; it should be profitable now.</em></p>

			<p>We're now in August, the launch month for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and the developers have now released a brand new trailer to show off all the available weapon options in the game.</p>



<p>The first one is of course the sword, which allows for fast, 'split-second strikes'. The greatsword, on the other hand, is slower but capable of 'earth-shattering power'. The third weapon is the poleblade, which is said to deliver a 'piercing storm' to enemies. The fourth and final option is the scythe, which enables 'cutting-edge control' of its strikes. The trailer also demonstrates how Lost Soul Aside allows seamless weapons swapping even mid-combo. Players can, for example, launch an enemy in the air with one weapon and then slam it back down with another. </p>



<p>The unique stats of each weapon can significantly influence the player's tactical approach. The weapons can also be enhanced and customized by using special weapon fragments discovered throughout Lost Soul Aside. These fragments can alter the weapons' appearance, enhance combat or healing capabilities, and upgrade Kaser's fighting style. Players can attach fragments to their weapons and experiment with unique combinations to discover thrilling and powerful effects.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside wears its inspiration (mainly games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta) on its sleeve, although technically it is described as having roleplaying elements, too. Indeed, protagonist Kaser will grow even stronger throughout the game by attaining new skills and abilities unlocked via a dedicated Skill Tree. These powerful skills, which can boost damage, enhance healing, and generate protective shields, are granted by the dragon-like creature Arena.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to further intensify attacks with precise, high-impact bursts of strength by timing button presses during weapon combos to achieve devastating results. Finally, the Fusion Gauge can be filled through attack combos and abilities to summon Arenaâ€™s claws and fiercely strike enemies. This upgradeable skill unlocks new combat techniques as Kaser progresses in his mission.</p>



<p>After over ten years of development, the game that started as a solo project by Yang Bing is scheduled to launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 29. You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>
