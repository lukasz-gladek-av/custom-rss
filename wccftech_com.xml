			<p>The full Nintendo Switch 2 system specifications have been detailed today, providing a better idea of what the system may be capable of and revealing some of the limitations developers will have to work around for their games.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">Digital Foundry</a> provided a full run-down of the system specifications for the next-generation Nintendo console, starting with the CPU. The ARM Cortex A7BC runs the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set with cryptography extensions enabled, with no support for 32-bit in the SDK, and features 64K of L1 instruction cache and another 64K for L1 data cache. Each of the eight cores has 256K of L2 cache, sharing 4MB of L3 cache. Like the original Nintendo Switch CPU, not all cores will be available for games, as two will be reserved for running the operating system. In terms of CPU maximum clock speed, the CPU can reach as high as 1.7 GHz, a lot higher than the figures of 1100 MHz for handheld mode and 998 MHz for docked mode. According to Digital Foundry, the max clock speed is a theoretical maximum that could be reached in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, Digital Foundry confirmed the specs leaked before the system was revealed. The console's GPU is built on the Ampere architecture, which powers the RTX 30 series GPU, has 1536 CUDA cores, and runs at 561 MHz in handheld mode and 1007 MHz in docked mode. The GPU can run as high as 1.4 GHz, but it's not clear if developers can push the GPU higher than the values indicated for handheld and docked modes. Additionally, developers won't be able to use all the GPU resources, as some are reserved for the system. The 3.072 TFLOPs figure was also confirmed by Digital Foundry, but it has become somewhat irrelevant to gauge the system's performance. Regarding the console's ray tracing capabilities, the Nintendo Switch 2 is rated for around 10 gigarays per second, 20 in docked mode.</p>
<p>Much like the CPU and the GPU, not all of the Nintendo Switch 2's 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM will be available for games. Besides confirming that the RAM comes with two 6 GB modules and its 102GB/s and 68GB/s bandwidth for docked and handheld modes respectively, Digital Foundry confirmed that 3 GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system, which is a much bigger chunk of RAM reserved for non-gaming functions compared to what was reserved for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Via the system's SDK, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm how the Nintendo Switch 2's custom-made FDE, File Decompression Engine, should allow for faster and more power-efficient decompression, and how VRR is only available for the system's screen, and is not currently supported over HDMI. It was also confirmed how Game Chat may have a certain performance impact on the system, so much so that a tool to test the function without an active session is being provided to developers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support multiple NVIDIA DLSS options—DLAA, 1x, 2x, and 3x options. While details on these options are not available, it is speculated that they could be equivalent to the Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes available on PC.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for select regions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another video game-to-film adaptation is in the works, and this time it's Ubisoft's open-world extreme-sports multiplayer game Riders Republic being made into a movie, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> reports.</p>
<p>The studio has teamed up with Bad Boys for Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah to direct the project, with Noé Debré signed on to write the script. Ubisoft and Gaumont will develop and produce the film.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/">Riders Republic</a> was a flawed but solid game for anyone who just wanted to jump on a bike and ride down the side of a mountain, hop on a snowboard, or just as quickly jump into several other sports of the extreme variety. It launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riders-republic-fixes-achievements-matchmaking-mass-races/">bunch of issues</a>, like most modern multiplayer games, but what it definitely wasn't known for was its rich characters and story.</p>
<p>Which means that, for now, it's anyone's guess as to what this movie will be about. The only note about what this movie will actually be about in Deadline's report says that the movie will capture the action of the extreme sports "<em>with humor and spectacular stunts on the snow-covered slopes of the Alps</em>."</p>
<p>We've been enjoying a renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations with some standout successes, like HBO's The Last of Us, Amazon's Fallout, the Sonic movies, and the Super Mario Bros. movie. But there have still been some big misses, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-tv-show-is-canceled-but-is-being-shopped-around-while-fallout-ramps-up-season-2-and-earns-emmy-nominations/">Paramount's Halo TV show</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-movie-handed-to-tim-miller-for-reshoots/">Borderlands</a> movie, which both showed that you can't just adapt any video game into a film and walk away with $1 billion.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft hadn't already tried to make a big blockbuster hit out of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-review/">Assassin's Creed</a> years ago, it would definitely have tried that in this current landscape before trying to make a Riders Republic movie. Perhaps casting and the 10 million player base that Deadline's report says Riders Republic has will help make the movie successful. But right now, that feels difficult to imagine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-nintendo-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most successful games to launch this year. Despite being available on Game Pass from day one, the JRPG developed by Sandfall Interactive has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to sell more than two million units</a>. Considering that its budget was certainly not as large as a regular triple-A game, its success is already guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may even get bigger by adding a new platform like the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with French YouTuber mistermtv</a>, as translated by MP1st, Sandfall Interactive CEO and Game Director Guillaume Broche said that the great sales have changed the perspective, and that the idea was 'interesting'.</p>
<p><em>Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything. So clearly, it’s too early to say, but we’re kind of in a situation where… let’s say there are a lot of opportunities showing up — way too many at once — and we’re figuring out what we’ll go for and what we won’t. But yeah, it’s definitely something that could be interesting.</em></p>
<p>A turn-based JRPG like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could indeed resonate very well with the Nintendo audience, which would get access to a fantastic game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but it's not one of the heaviest titles made with Epic's technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could likely run it. Whether that means Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive actually make the port remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-%E2%80%93-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week.1189017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has announced STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy - Enhanced Edition, an updated version of the first three STALKER games it previously released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/">PS4 and Xbox One,</a> now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC next week on <strong>May 20, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new current-gen version of the remasters includes better lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, upscaled textures and environments, advanced shaders, and cutscenes that have been pre-rendered in 4K to add to the storytelling. For console players, though, the catch to all that is you'll see as much of these upgrades as the graphics mode you pick will allow.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, PS5 Pro, or Xbox Series X consoles, players can select between four graphics modes. Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance. The first three are all set at a 4K resolution, with the frame rate caps being the only variable. Quality runs at 4K/30fps, Balanced runs at 4K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 4K/60fps. Ultra Performance sets the resolution down to 2K to reach 120fps.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox Series S players have Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes to choose from, though none of those modes have any of the three STALKER games running at 4K. Quality mode on Series S runs at 2K/30fps, Balanced runs at 2K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 1080p/60fps.</p>
<p>Obviously, PC players don't have to deal with all of that and can more manually adjust graphical settings based on the hardware they have available to them, but there are still a few improvements PC players can look forward to. Such as the games now being optimized for Steam Deck, and support for cloud saves.</p>
<p>Current-gen console players will also be able to plug in a keyboard and mouse, if they want, with KBM support coming in this new version. GSC Game World has also confirmed that the PS5 and Xbox Series versions will have Mod.io support, so they can enjoy some of the modding fun that is usually only accessible on PC.</p>
<p>The best part about this new Enhanced Edition is that anyone who has already purchased any of the remasters in the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will get the corresponding enhanced edition for <strong>free</strong>.</p>
