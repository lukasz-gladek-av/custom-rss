			<p>The award-winning cRPG <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong> couldn't possibly run on the original <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/modded-nintendo-switch-baldurs-gate-3-run-crysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a test made with a modded console</a> that featured twice the amount of RAM (<strong>8GB</strong> instead of <strong>4GB</strong>), with the game still bringing this 'Switch on steroids' on its knees.</p>



<p>However, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> is a completely different beast. In some regards, it is even superior to the Xbox Series S, as Studio Wildcard's Lead Programmer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just told me in an interview</a>, and the Xbox Series S does run the game, albeit not very well. <span>Additionally, there have been successful Switch ports of computationally intensive games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</a>, to name a few, and the&nbsp;<strong>Steam Deck</strong>&nbsp;native version of BG3&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">has also made great strides</a></span>. Furthermore, last year, insider Nate the Hate had shared that he heard Baldur's Gate 3 might indeed be coming to the new Nintendo console. </p>



<p>All in all, there was good reason to believe this version would arrive at some point. However, during today's Reddit AMA, <strong>Larian CEO Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the topic</a> with a negative response:</p>



<p><em>We would have loved to, but it wasn't our decision to make.</em></p>



<p>That sounded like Vincke hinting it might be due to issues with IP holder <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>. Larian famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to pivot away from Baldur's Gate 3 DLC and a sequel</a> to make something else (which we recently learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a new <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), and fans have long suspected that there was a fracture between the two companies, although Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-ceo-clarifies-wizards-of-the-coast-was-a-a-great-licensor-and-had-nothing-to-do-with-bg4-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly said</a> their decision had nothing to do with the company. </p>



<p>In the ResetEra thread that picked up Vincke's Reddit comment, Nate the Hate quickly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/swen-vincke-no-baldurs-gate-3-for-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision-to-make.1401871/post-149859475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>From what I was told last year… It's a complicated situation and involved their relationship with WotC.</em></p>



<p>At this point, the question is whether Wizards of the Coast might be looking for someone else to port their massively successful game. Last month, it was announced that Baldur's Gate 3 had surpassed <strong>20 million copies sold</strong>, a nearly unthinkable figure for a cRPG before Larian's game. It's hard to imagine it wouldn't sell at least a few more million units on the rapidly growing Switch 2 installed base.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast, asking for a comment, and will update this story if and when we receive it. Nintendo Switch 2 users who may be into Larian games can, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition</a> in the meantime, and the studio's Technical Director just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in the Reddit AMA</a> that <strong>they will consider a port of the future Divinity game</strong>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">It's been over two years since <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> confirmed</a> that it would be making <strong>The Division 3</strong>, and that series creator<strong> Julian Gerighty</strong> would be at the forefront of the project. Since then, Ubisoft has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">major updates and expansions for The Division 2</a>, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, we even got a major reveal of what the company has planned for the franchise, with a new survival extraction game called The Division 2: Survivors and an upcoming mobile MMO title called The Division Resurgence.</p>



<p>As for The Division 3? Ubisoft did not mention it at the time, but during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> when Gerighty was showcasing and discussing The Division 2: Survivors, he also answered a question regarding The Division 3.</p>



<p>While he couldn't say much beyond the fact that the game is still coming and a confirmation that it is in production, he does set the expectation bar quite high for what players can look forward to.</p>



<p>"<em>So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Division 2 Developer Interview | New Game+ Showcase 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GE_C1ueUnss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Gerighty isn't saying too much, and he quickly moves on to continue talking about Survivors and Resurgence, since those are the two projects that he was technically supposed to be talking about. But as you'll see from the first few comments under the interview, players were more pleased to just have a few new words on The Division 3. </p>



<p>Hopefully, these aren't the last words we hear on the game before 2026 is done. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong> will officially be seven years old when we get to March 12, 2026, and while Ubisoft Massive has done a great job in maintaining the third-person shooter and updating it with new content, for two, arguably three of those last seven years, all players have wanted to see is a third mainline entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>We likely won't get it in 2026, but hopefully, we'll know to expect it for 2027.</p>
