			<p>The upcoming PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode will impact performance so much, especially with reduced memory bandwidth, that it's unlikely that better power efficiency is its only goal</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the upcoming Power Saver mode that has already been introduced to the system with a beta system software update, highlighting how the stated goal of improving the system's power efficiency is unlikely to be the main goal of this new mode for a few reasons. For starters, some of the rumored limitations it brings, such as significantly reduced memory bandwidth, will impact the system's performance a lot, so much so that the most demanding games will run poorly in Power Saver mode without the developer's intervention, and asking developers to target this mode also seems to be quite a lot to ask, if power efficiency is the only goal. Even looking from a user's perspective, the PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode doesn't make a lot of sense, according to Digital Foundry, as it's very unlikely someone would gimp their systems just to have minimal savings on energy bills, with the expected minimal difference in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, how Microsoft has handled power efficiency for its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is another strong indication that the PlayStation 5 Powr Saver mode's main goal is something other. In Fortnite, for example, Microsoft introduced some tweaks to save power without requiring developer intervention, such as reducing the framerate of the game's main menu to save power if the system is left idling, and changing the game's dynamic resolution scaling with no impact on the experience. As such, having an entire system setting to address power efficiency seems to force a lot of work on developers for very little gain for the end user.</p>



<p>As such, Digital Foundry thinks this new PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode is being introduced to provide developers with some specs targets for a future device. A low-power PS5 in the vein of the Xbox Series S seems very unlikely this late in the generation, and the reduced memory bandwidth is a strong indication that Power Saver mode has, as rumored, some relation with a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">future handheld system.</a></p>

<p>Besides introducing Power Saver mode, which currently cannot be tested as no game supports this new setting, the new PlayStation 5 beta firmware introduces some welcome new features, including the ability to pair DualSense controllers with multiple devices at the same time.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/atari-to-acquire-82-6-stake-in-thunderful-group-with-e4-5-million-investment-amid-restructuring-and-layoffs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Atari entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in Thunderful Group, the publisher of the SteamWorld series, among other franchises, with a massive investment, while the Swedish company continues its restructuring process, which is sadly leading to layoffs.</p>



<p>In today's <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html">announcement</a>, Atari confirmed it is investing 50 million SEK, around €4.5 million, in Thunderful through a directed share issue. Once finalized, this investment will give Atari ownership of roughly 82.6% of Thunderful, effectively making it the company’s new owner. This agreement, however, still requires approval from Thunderful's shareholders with a vote that will be taken during a meeting scheduled to be held around August 28.</p>



<p>Besides announcing the new agreement with Atari, Thunderful Group <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">announced</a> today that a restructuring of the company's operations has begun to reduce the cost base with the aim of improving operating cash flow. This decision was made after a strategic review highlighted that the company needs to adjust its costs to achieve profitability even at lower revenue levels. Unfortunately, this restructuring is leading to layoffs within game development studios and publishing business, continuing a trend that shows no sign of slowing down. Patrick Svensk, Chairman of Thunderful, commented on the ongoing restructuring, which is expected to continue even after Atari acquires the company, saying: <em>"It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues. At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact."</em></p>



<p>Atari's proposed acquisition of Thunderful Group seems to indicate a change of strategy at the publisher, which has mostly focused on a retro-focused strategy with the acquisition of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-acquires-digital-eclipse-to-bolster-its-retro-focused-strategy/">Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-purchase-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a>. As such, it will be very interesting to see what's in store for the future of one of gaming's better-known companies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wb-games-montr%C3%A9al-might-be-making-another-dc-comics-live-service-game.1255713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In October 2024, a job listing <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-montreal-rumored-to-be-working-on-new-dc-comics-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that WB Games Montréal was recruiting for a new game based on a DC Comics license. That was fairly unsurprising in itself, considering that the developer has only ever worked on such games, from 2013's Batman: Arkham Origins to 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gotham Knights</a>. Now, though, <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another job listing</a> suggests that this project is being designed as a live service, which was enough to ruffle the feathers of many fans. </p>



<p>The job listing is for an Executive Producer who would oversee many aspects of the game's development, including the planned live service operations, as stated in the excerpt below.</p>



<p><em>As an Executive Producer, you will lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog. You will oversee the entire production lifecycle—from concept to launch and beyond—ensuring the game meets the highest standards of quality, innovation, and player engagement. You will work closely with the Creative Director and studio leadership to align creative vision with production realities, manage cross-functional teams, and ensure the project delivers on time, on budget, and to critical and commercial success.</em></p>



<p><strong><u><em>Production Oversight:</em></u></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure robust QA and live operations processes are in place to support a high-quality player experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Execution and Market Readiness:</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee post-launch content and live service strategy, ensuring ongoing player engagement.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Anyone who followed Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will understand why many fans are already quite disappointed by the prospect. Created specifically as a live service game based on the popular team of DC Comics antiheroes, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed so spectacularly that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused</a> a $200 million lower EBITDA and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">41% year-to-year decrease in revenue</a> for Warner Bros. Games compared to the previous highly successful launch of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Granted, one game's failure does not equal another. Sure, there have been several failed live service games over the last few years, but a few have also succeeded, and when they do, they rake in big money. That's why publishers keep trying, and we already have plenty of indication that WB Games (now restructured into four divisions dedicated to its tentpole franchises) has not been deterred by the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. They are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eager to make a Hogwarts Legacy live service game</a>, after all.</p>



<p>Of course, it's way too early to say which DC Comics license WB Games Montréal will use for its next project. Still, we'll keep an eye out for further listings and rumors.</p>
