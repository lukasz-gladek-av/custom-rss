			<p>The success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 2025</a> doesn't just mean more college football games down the line for American football fans. It also means the return of other collegiate-level sports games from EA, as the company has just pointed to an EA Sports College Basketball game on the horizon.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660">official EA Sports X account</a> teases the return of the series, captioned with EA saying "<em>Bring the Madness. Let's run it back</em>,<em>" </em>adding hashtags for college basketball as 'CBB' and the popular EA Sports tagline 'It's in the game.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last time EA released a college basketball game was 2009, with the release of NCAA Basketball 10, and according to <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/memo-ea-sports-looks-to-bring-back-college-basketball-video-games-starting-in-2028-2029-0ef3">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">GameSpot</a>), a memo from the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) puts the first game in EA's return to college basketball arriving in 2028. </p>



<p>If it hits that release window, then that means the first game in what'll likely be called 'EA Sports College Basketball' will be out almost two decades since the last time EA had a college basketball game on shelves. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA confirmed</a> that sales for College Football 25 exceeded $1 billion, so it's not the biggest shock that the company would look to bring back its other collegiate-level sports series. It'll be interesting to see how <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-football-26-madden-nfl-26-release-dates-announced-no-ps4-and-xbox-one-versions/">EA Sports College Football 26</a> does in comparison, to see just how strong the desire is from college sports fans to have these games return as an annual series again.</p>

			<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition may not be too far from release on Nintendo Switch 2, as the new edition of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware has been recently rated in the United States.</p>



<p>As the game has been available for a while on other formats, the Switch 2 edition's ESRB rating, which can be found <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">here</a>, wouldn't have been notable if the game's release date was known. However, the fact that the rating has been made public shortly before this week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-summer-showcase-my-hero-academia-game/">Bandai Namco showcase</a> suggests that the release date announcement and subsequent release may not be too far in the future.</p>



<p>The Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was among the third-party games revealed during the big Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event held back in April. The new edition of the celebrated game will come with new features not found in the original release, such as two new starting classes, four new Armor sets, new weapons and skills, three Torrent customization options, and some yet-to-be-detailed quality-of-life improvements. The Tarnished Edition will also include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a></strong>, which introduces a second map and some pretty challenging enemies.</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn why the base game is one of the best action RPGs by FromSoftware by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
