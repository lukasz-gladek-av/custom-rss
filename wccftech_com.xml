			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, is out on PS5 and PC in a little more than two weeks' time from the time of this writing. Despite it having a rough road to launch, now that we're so close to it, the game looks more impressive than ever, and its new 'Death Awaits' trailer ahead of its <strong>open preview server slam test</strong> next weekend is the latest example of just how solid it looks.</p>



<p>The server slam test will give Bungie the chance to let the servers get pushed to their limit right ahead of launch, as the test will take place from <strong>February 26 to March 2</strong>. Marathon arrives on PC and PS5 three days later, on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on Marathon's journey, how it looks is not the only impressive thing about it; it's also impressive to see the buzz around the game. It was always going to have an uphill battle, coming in as the game that had to shoulder Bungie's future hopes while its marquee franchise, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">Destiny</a></strong>, continued to flounder.  </p>

<p>Marathon lost its <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">game director amidst a scandal </a>near the beginning of its production. It's suffered through <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">more than one round of layoffs at Bungie</a>. It had a massive scandal regarding the game's whole artistic foundation and aesthetic being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">ripped from another artist without permission</a>. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a>, ad even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">believed to be dead</a> by some of its biggest doubters. </p>



<p>Its closed, NDA-protected beta tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-leaked-closed-technical-test-bungie/">kept leaking gameplay like crazy</a>, and the last major public beta test <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">wasn't as well-received as Bungie would've hoped</a>, even providing a solid sounding board for other games to do better.</p>



<p>Now, though, as we sit days away from launch, even though it's still far too early to say Marathon has the ability to 'save Bungie,' it looks clear that this won't be a flop. Marathon has the chance to start off strong and grow into another strong title in Bungie's portfolio.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/</link>
            <guid>1438363</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">issued a statement</a> regarding a major glitch in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> that players have been exploiting recently, which allowed players to duplicate their <strong>coins</strong>, essentially destroying the in-game economy and allowing players to buy their way back to full strength and then some, if they lost their gear while <strong>Topside</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether the statement will apply to you or not depends on how much you took advantage of the exploit. For "<em>severe cases</em>," the players who took huge advantage of it will be <strong>suspended</strong> from the game. How long those suspensions last is currently unclear, but that is the action Embark will go with if it deems your abuse of the exploit to have "<em>had a significant impact on the in-game economy or other players’ experience</em>."</p>



<p>If you just dabbled with it, then you'll simply be issued a warning. Also, it should go without saying that all players who took advantage of the exploit will have the coins earned through the exploit removed from their accounts.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>Thank you to everyone who sent us reports of the recent duplication exploit, and to everyone who continued playing in good faith while we took the time to properly investigate the issue.<br>Starting this week we will begin issuing enforcement actions to… <a href="https://t.co/VatYFM7ljV">pic.twitter.com/VatYFM7ljV</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2023752363853463637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game’s economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance</em>," writes Embark Studios. "<em>Over the course of this week, we will begin issuing enforcement actions to accounts that we can confirm took advantage of these exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark goes on to explain that it took as long as it did to respond to these exploits because it wanted to do a thorough investigation to not only discover and fix the issue, but to make sure that it fairly addressed the players who abused the exploit without over-punishing those who perhaps used it once or twice.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing. This is the first time we’ve handled an incident of this nature at such scale in ARC Raiders. Rather than rushing, we chose to take the time needed to fully understand the situation and make sure our response was consistent with our values and expectations.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark continues, "<em>It's our hope that this response provides a platform for future action, and we’ve already improved our detection and tracking, internal review tools, and safeguards to limit the impact of similar exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We take this incident seriously, and we’re approaching it as both a corrective effort and a learning opportunity to strengthen the systems that support fair play.</em>"</p>



<p>So if you had your fun with the exploit, it's clear to say that not only is that done, but Embark has no time for players who look to these exploits. With how well ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">continues to sell</a>, these kinds of problems are bound to pop up, and it's good to know for the players who want an even playing field that Embark does not play around with these kinds of problems.</p>

			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026</strong> has already seen the release of some excellent games, with many more on the way, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> is poised to dominate the gaming year in terms of sales, as the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">double dela</strong>y</a> did not dampen the excitement surrounding the highly anticipated next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The next entry in the popular series is not the only open-world game launching this year, and of them, <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>' <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/">Crimson Desert</a></em></strong> could be the <strong>Game of the Year</strong> if, by any chance, <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> ends up failing, according to a former <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> animator.</p>



<p><em>"This game, this could be Game of the Year, okay. Mark my words,"</em> former <strong><em>GTA V</em></strong> and <strong><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></strong> animator <strong>Mike York</strong> stated in a recent breakdown of <strong><em>Crimson Desert</em></strong>’s features. <em>"And the reason for that is because of how much you can get lost in this game... it really is a contender when it comes to all the cool stuff all this game kind of has to offer."</em></p>



<p><em>"If GTA VI drops the ball, this could be Game of the Year,"</em> <strong>York</strong> added during the recent analysis. <em>"If GTA VI wasn't here at all this year, this (Crimson Desert) would probably take Game of the Year, from what it looks like."</em></p>



<p>Clearly, there's a lot that is still unknown about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crimson Desert</em></strong>, especially how such a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/"><strong>diverse set of features and mechanics</strong></a> will come together, and if the game's story will be memorable. However, from what has been seen so far, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mike York</strong> feels <span><strong>cautiously optimistic</strong>&nbsp;about the game, especial</span>ly regarding its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">physics-based interactivity</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mechanical depth</strong>, with an impressive level of detail in the world-building. Coming from someone with <a href="https://mikeyork.wixsite.com/demo/resume"><strong>an impressive resume</strong></a> who has worked on some of the best games ever, this sounds like some very high praise.</p>
