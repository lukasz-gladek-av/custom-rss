			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, Tuesday, August 19, 2025, that's 45-minutes long, featuring legendary game director and designer Masahiro Sakurai, that's all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>The news first broke on the Nintendo Today app, before being published to social media, as we've seen Nintendo do several times now regarding major news and updates for its products. It'll kick off at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Aug 19 at 6am PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders/status/1957432749125779831">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Kirby Air Riders account reads. "<em>The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be the first we've seen of the first non-Smash Bros. game from Sakurai in years, and the first Switch 2 game directed by Sakurai. The game is also currently set to release sometime later this year, so it's likely that tomorrow's presentation will also include an official release date announcement, along with a bevy of information and gameplay footage of what to expect from the follow-up to the 2003 GameCube title, Kirby Air Ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In what feels like the greatest period of turmoil for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/">Ubisoft</a> in the company's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to be the bright spark of life that the company needs, as a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">The Game Business</a> (backed by numbers from Europe's <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">Game Sales Data</a> firm) names it the best-selling new game in Europe in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>To clarify, Shadows is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling PC and console title in Europe of all the games released in 2025. It's not the best-selling game overall, since that marker unsurprisingly goes to last year's EA Sports FC 25, which will likely hold the title until <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">EA Sports FC 26</a> next month. But as of right now, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands above games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-drive-another-record-year-for-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and every other major release you can think of from this year so far.</p>



<p>In fact, according to GSD figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">Split-Fiction</a> is the only game to get close to Shadows as far as 2025 releases are concerned. The next-closest is Monster Hunter Wilds, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-early-digital-sales-toby-fox-deltarune/">Mario Kart World</a>, which is followed by Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, and Nightreign after that. Out of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe for 2025 so far, including games released last year and older, Split-Fiction, Wilds, World, Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, Nightreign, and Shadows are the only seven games released in 2025 to make the list.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the list not released in 2025 are <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which is having an incredible year despite being nearly eight years old at this point, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, which is enjoying a boost from Ubisoft revamping it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">Rainbow Six Siege X.</a></p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe on PC and consoles according to GSD, per The Game Business: </p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Split-Fiction</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Mario Kart World</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto Online</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</li>



<li>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</li>



<li>Battlefield 1</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that this is just what the sales charts for Europe's PC and console videogame releases look like so far. Those are the key words here, because by the end of this year, it's doubtful that Shadows will be able to hold onto that top spot for 2025 releases. Not just because EA Sports FC 26 is on the horizon, but because FC 26 is coming, and this year's new Call of Duty, and Battlefield 6, and Borderlands 4, and Ghost of Yotei, and Pokemon Legends Z-A, and The Outer Worlds 2 - and those are just some of the big autumn-to-winter-timed games we know about that have release dates.</p>



<p>We'll see what this top-20 list looks like in a few months' time. But for now, Ubisoft can enjoy its moment at the top.</p>
