			<p>UK indie developer Playtonic Games is about to launch Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of 2017's platform game Yooka-Laylee, and they have now shared the first gameplay footage and info on the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The footage was provided to IGN and you can find it embedded below. As for the Switch 2 port, Playtonic Games <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971201407001809335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X today</a> that this version will only run at 30 frames per second, on both handheld and TV mode.</p>



<p><em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode. Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch.</em></p>



<p><em>We've also received a lot of questions regarding a playable demo on Nintendo Switch 2. Unfortunately, this is not something we're able to accommodate pre-launch but are planning to release post-launch.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">pushed to all platforms today</a>, adding an FOV slider for console players, stability and performance improvements for all platforms, UI, audio, visual, gear refinements, and more.</p>



<p>As the latest entry in Gearbox's shooter series, even with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical acclaim from multiple outlets</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">major commercial success right at launch</a>, the story of Borderlands 4 isn't about everyone grabbing their own copies and having a blast. </p>



<p>It's about the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">poor technical performance at launch</a>, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford's bizarre approach of antagonizing players upset at the state of the game</a>, and, as of two days ago, how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has been indefinitely delayed</a> while Gearbox works on the versions already in players' hands.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today's update, and every update that'll come after it, is slowly trying to chip away at that narrative and turn it around from 'Borderlands 4 is broken but fun' to 'Borderlands 4 is fun.'</p>



<p>Starting with stability updates and performance improvements, which are key elements of today's update, and will likely remain key elements of every update going forward. Character animations have been updated, issues of frame rate hitching and crashes have been addressed, and several issues where players didn't get the rewards they were owed from completing an objective have been fixed. </p>



<p>For console players, an FOV slider has finally been added, and for all players, there's a series of balance changes for each of the Vault Hunters and several gameplay elements.</p>



<p>It's all a start, of course, but the work on Borderlands 4 is far from done. Hopefully, it doesn't take Gearbox too much longer to fix the myriad of issues the game launched with. Though with how many problems the game had, it feels like we're in this for the long haul.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-gameplay-ea-battlefield-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-portal-gameplay-appears-online-shows-just-how-far-the-editor-can-be-pushed.1309014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-debuts-battlefield-6-campaign-trailer/">we got our first look at the campaign mode</a> in Battlefield 6 during Sony's State of Play presentation. Today, gameplay from the upcoming Portal mode in Battlefield 6 has appeared online, and it's a major showcase of just how far players will be able to push this new Portal.</p>



<p>If you're unfamiliar, the Portal in Battlefield 6 is where players can access other player-made game modes and levels that drastically change everything about what it is to play Battlefield 6. It's a full-blown creative mode where you can make seemingly anything you can think of using assets and models already in Battlefield, and this year's version of it seems to be more expansive than ever before.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer for the mode from EA and Battlefield Studios that was <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1971228205387317485">posted to X (formerly Twitter)</a> shows a bit of what this new tier of level-crafting potential looks like, with quick shots of the editor and how granular players can get.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6RGo76uyTk&amp;t=5s">YouTuber JackFrags</a> shows off some of the Battlefield Studios-made modes that really show off how you can just create whatever you want in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. Want to recreate Counter-Strike? Check. Want to create your own Battlefield version of Call of Duty Zombies? Check. Want to make a version of Only Up where you're competing against other squads to race to the top and hold that position? Check. Racing F-16s, creating your own conquest maps, re-drawing out-of-bounds lines, adjusting every detail of the gameplay experience? Check.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's far more freedom than we've seen in previous Battlefield games, and while the modes created by Battlefield Studios shown in the video are just a few of the more obvious options (like a Zombies mode or racing vehicles), you can only imagine the kinds of modes players will make once they get their hands on it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to find out, as Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming October 10, 2025.</p>
