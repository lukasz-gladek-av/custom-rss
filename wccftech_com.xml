			<p>Crystal Dynamics announced that it has laid off "<em>just under 30</em>" developers, as part of the company's current restructuring. These cuts are the second layoff the company has had this year. The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/">company's LinkedIn page</a>, and called the decision "<em>difficult, but necessary</em>." It also claimed that this decision was made as a way to optimize the development of the next major Tomb Raider game it is currently making.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation</em>," the studio wrote in its statement.</p>



<p>"<em>Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future.</em>"</p>



<p>It always feels like a contradiction that a studio would lay off staff to 'optimize' a studio's development, because having fewer people to work on the game means that the remaining staff have to do more with less. It sounds like it creates more bottlenecks than optimizations.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear more about the coming Tomb Raider game soon, though currently it seems like the next major Tomb Raider project we'll hear about will be the upcoming film, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">which stars Game of Throne's Sophie Turner in the titular role</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a new ESRB rating hinted that Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-switch2-ps5-xbox-series-port/">would be coming to current-generation consoles,</a> Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">officially confirmed the news</a> that both the base game and its Undead Nightmare DLC would be arriving on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 next month, December 2, 2025, with the additional surprise that it'll be coming to iOS and Android mobile devices, too.</p>



<p>For anyone who already bought Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch/">on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch,</a> you won't have to buy it again, as Rockstar is making this a free update for anyone who already owns the game on any of those platforms.</p>



<p>On Xbox Series X/S and PS5, players can enjoy this new current-gen native version at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support and an enhanced image quality, while the Switch 2 version includes support for DLSS, HDR, and the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls. It'll also run at 60 FPS on Switch 2, according to Rockstar.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>On top of this new current-gen native version coming as a free upgrade, players on PlayStation subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra will be able to dive into the game with its new update as of December 2, 2025, when it joins the library of PS Plus Extra titles. Players with a GTA+ subscription will also be able to jump in when it arrives through their subscription.</p>



<p>Regarding the mobile versions, while you'll be able to grab it on the Google Play or App Store, if you have a Netflix subscription, you'll also be able to access the game through the Netflix app as part of your subscription.</p>



<p>It's great to see Red Dead Redemption make its current-gen console debut, and to know that we'll be able to revisit this classic game on modern hardware at an appropriate resolution and frame rate. However, the matter of Red Dead Redemption 2 still being without a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version is still unsolved. </p>



<p>Hopefully, that's next on the docket, if Rockstar can find the time between <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">getting ready for Grand Theft Auto VI</a> and dealing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">backlash it has wrought upon itself through alleged union busting</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Steel Frontiers Isn’t The Only Horizon Multiplayer Game Guerilla Has In Development]]></title>

			<p>Guerilla Games and NCSoft finally announced the Horizon-based MMORPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">we've been hearing about for years</a> today with the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">Horizon Steel Frontiers,</a> which is coming to PC and mobile sometime within the next couple of years. But that's not the only multiplayer Horizon game that Guerilla has on the go.</p>



<p>While previous rumors about an upcoming Horizon multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">seem to have been focused on the coming MMORPG</a>, Guerilla's next major release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, is a separate multiplayer game that the company is working on.</p>



<p>"<em>Just to clear up some confusion I've seen</em>," Schreier writes in a post on Bluesky, "<em>the newly announced NCSoft Horizon MMO is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that's in development at Guerilla Games. That one is Guerilla's next big project</em>."</p>







<p>Unlike Steel Frontiers, which is coming to PC and mobile, and not PS5, this new multiplayer title from Guerilla will likely not be skipping Sony's console, though it will still likely be a multi-platform release to at least PC players.</p>



<p>Now that Steel Frontiers has had its official reveal, hopefully this other project that the studio is working on isn't too far behind. Guerilla's studio director Jan-Bart van Beek made it clear a couple of short years ago that the team is continuing with the Horizon franchise for a long while, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-developer-has-16-plans-for-the-franchise-highlights-challenges-in-creating-the-multiplayer-game/">that they have scores of ideas on where to take it, new multiplayer games being just one of those avenues</a>. </p>
