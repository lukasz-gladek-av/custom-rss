			<p><strong>Update 02/05/2025:</strong> According to <a href="https://it.ign.com/chrono-trigger/217954/news/square-enix-potrebbe-essere-al-lavoro-su-un-remake-di-chrono-trigger-si-attende-lufficialita">IGN Italy</a>, Yuji Horii's words about a Chrono Trigger Remake were, "<em>I understand there is also a remake in development</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">The Shadow Syndicate</a> is a new game from indie developer KillaSoft, announced during the Future Game Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam. Playing as a grizzled husky detective, you'll solve the mystery and supernatural conspiracy at the heart of its 1930s Brooklyn setting.</p>
<p>A narrative-driven game, The Shadow Syndicate, will have you paying attention to clues, talking to the other animals in Brooklyn, and breaking a few skulls through third-person shooting, with the help of a good amount of bullet-time action when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You'll play as retired soldier turned private detective Sam Marlowe, discovering what turns out to be a city-wide supernatural conspiracy with secret societies, occult powers, and some mysterious darkness that threatens to consume Brooklyn.</p>
<p>But you're not just bringing a gun to a magic fight, as your Sacrifice Ring lets you use a slew of powerful abilities. However, it should come as no surprise that using something called the 'Sacrifice Ring' comes at a cost. Each power will strengthen you, but they all come with a deadly curse that will loom over you with each ability gained.</p>
<p>There were several games shown off during the Future Games Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam, but The Shadow Syndicate was both one of the most interesting games shown and one of the few brand-new announcements. Hopefully, we will hear more about it soon.</p>
<p>The Shadow Syndicate is currently set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.</p>
