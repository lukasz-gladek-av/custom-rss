			<p>Today, Hello Games has released a long-awaited feature for No Man's Sky: cross-save. The small developer said it was a huge undertaking, but it was one of the most requested features from the community.</p>
<p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server was particularly challenging for No Man's Sky, as the workload increases with each platform supported and the length of time people have been playing. Hello Games found that many players had accumulated thousands of hours in their saves, which inevitably made it more complicated for them to implement this feature. For these reasons, they have slowly worked on the technology needed for the cross-save update for over six months.</p>
<p>The rollout begins now with a small number of players. Starting today, all No Man's Sky players can link their different accounts <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. A subset of players will then be able to select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. Over the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p>

<p>Thanks to cross-save, players can play on their console from the comfort of their sofa, continue one of the game's Expeditions on the move with the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their powerful PC rig, and then view it in incredibly immersive virtual reality. No Man's Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save across the following platforms: PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2 and PC VR.</p>

<p>That's not all, as today's update marks the return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-comes-to-no-mans-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with BioWare's Mass Effect franchise</a> on N7 Day. Starting today and for the next two weeks, No Man's Sky players are getting another chance to meet the SSV Normandy SR1 in a reworked version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p>
