			<p>Silent Hill f locks every cutscene to 30 FPS on all formats, but on PC, this limitation can be easily lifted with Special K, delivering a smoother experience, although with some caveats.</p>



<p>Yesterday, BenchmarKing reported on <a href="https://x.com/BMKing23">their X profile</a> that the 30 FPS lock can be lifted by using the Framerate Limiter function of what is commonly known as the Swiss Army Knife of PC gaming, delivering smoother transitions between cutscenes and gameplay and an overall better experience. If you have never heard of this tool, more information and a download link can be found on the <a href="https://www.special-k.info/">Special K official website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After testing this out, I can say that removing the lock with Special K improves the experience, but with some caveats. In the opening cutscenes, for example, some sequences benefit more than others from a higher framerate. The sequence where Hinako and her sister have a brief talk, and the following family argument between Hinako and her parents, benefit the most thanks to there being more action on screen and quick camera cuts. The sequence showing Ebisugaoka under the rain, on the other hand, shows less noticeable improvements due to slower camera cuts and a lack of action, limited to the falling rain.</p>



<p>Although I didn't find the Silent Hill f 30 FPS lock for cutscenes particularly impactful, it is definitely surprising that it has been implemented, as it makes transitions from cutscenes to gameplay clunky and somewhat unpleasant. While this stopgap solution is welcome, an official removal of the lock would be preferable, as every cutscene would benefit from running at higher framerates.</p>



<p>Not counting some weird design choices like this cutscene framerate lock, Silent Hill f is a thououghly enjoyable game, thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">engaging and memorable story and gameplay that masterfully blends familiar mechanics with some new features</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S to all those who purchased the Deluxe Edition. It will launch for everyone else tomorrow, September 25.</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en">annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, Square Enix released two new trailers for Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, providing new looks at the two HD-2D games launching this December and next year, respectively.</p>



<p>The Octopath Traveler 0 trailer, which can be watched below, provides a quick look at the game's story and setting, highlighting how players will return to the continent of Orsterra and witness a tale of beginnings. This tale will be made more engaging to experience with some new gameplay features never seen before in the series, like the ability to customize the main playable character, new town building mechanics, and enhanced turn-based combat where players will be able to bring eight characters at the same time, over the four that could be brought in the first two entries in the series.</p>

<p>While much different from Octopath Traveler 0, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales will have plenty to offer to fans of classic role-playing games besides the gorgeous HD-2D visuals. The new Tokyo Game Show trailer shared today provides a solid overview of the action-focused experience, which looks like a modern take on the classic top-down ARPG formula seen in older entries in The Legend of Zelda series.</p>

<p>Scheduled for release sometime in 2026, and with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">playable demo publicly available on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, I wasn't surprised that a more recent build of The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales wasn't available during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>. My disappointment, however, was made easier to bear by having the chance of testing out Octopath Traveler 0 before its launch on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch. Although my time with the game was short, preventing me from getting deeper into the town building mechanics, it was more than enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved/">appreciate some of the enhancements to the series formula</a>, especially the bigger combat party,. which are set to open a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-steam-deck-native-version-brings-performance-improvements-in-act-3-new-video-highlights.1306374/</guid>

			<p>The recently released Steam Deck native build of Baldur's Gate 3 introduces noticeable performance improvements where they matter most, although it is not possible to currently judge how much performance is improved with actual data due to benchmarking tools not being available with this build, according to a new video shared online.</p>



<p>The new video focused on the new build of the cRPG developed by Larian Studio and shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> highlights how the new native build of the game feels smoother in Act 3. This area is known to be extremely demanding and struggles to run smoothly on every platform, and the footage shown during the video definitely suggests that performance has indeed been improved in some capacity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to know how much performance is improved in the new build because benchmarking tools are unavailable without the Proton compatibility layer. This also prevents users from <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">enabling AMD FSR 4 for better image quality</a>, although Lossless Scaling appears to work even without the compatibility layer, so an upscaling option is still available those who want to enjoy the game with this build.</p>

<iframe title="New Baldur's Gate 3 Steam Deck Update Just Dropped.." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sCMGywSJ-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though the most significant new addition, the native Steam Deck build is only one of the new features introduced in Baldur's Gate 3 by Hotfix #34. The other improvements and fixes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940?emclan=103582791464711919&amp;emgid=511843343389426278">outlined in the official update notes</a> are stability improvements on Xbox consoles, gameplay and audio fixes, and much more.</p>



<p>Considering how long Baldur's Gate 3 is, improving the Steam Deck handheld experience with a native build is highly welcome, allowing more users to experience one of the best cRPGs released in recent times. No matter the platform on which it is played, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game more than worthy of experiencing, in my opinion, thanks to an engaging story, a charming cast of characters, and deep role-playing game mechanics, which make for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">a great adaptation of the D&amp;D 5e ruleset</a>.</p>
