			<p>If you're going to be a blood-sucker, you at least want to be fashionable when you do it. In a new dev diary released by The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive, they've teamed up to discuss how fashion plays a part in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Each clan has its own set of styles that make it easily identifiable when speaking to them or exploring the streets of Seattle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">four base clans</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 each have their own unique style to represent personality, history, and subcultures through their fashion. When creating the fashion in the game, they wanted to make sure that they were offering players "a variety of styles to suit their tastes."&nbsp; Not only did they make sure that there were different outfits for the Protagonist, but they also made sure that the Foley was fairly attributed to the outfit, with the sounds of shoes or the rustling of clothes. For example, "creating a more stealth-like feeling or the aggressive presence that one might expect between Banu Haqim vs Brujah," says Lead Audio Designer Tessa Verplancke.</p>

<p>Additionally, making sure that outfits matter in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, characters are also able to judge their outfits, such as interactions you have with Tolly. This is shown in a brief clip on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-fashion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradox Interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>As the protagonist in this game, clothing matters because of the sound it can make. For example, if you want to feed on the right Blood Resonance, you need to make sure that you're wearing clothes that fit the mood of the person you're approaching.</p>
<p>"Just knowing that the angry sex worker nearby is full of choleric blood and ready for a fight is just step one. Step two is making sure that you're wearing something that will push them over the edge and really make that blood boil. Dressing and acting like a wealthy John could get them talking, but if you approach looking like someone who likes it rough? That might scare them right out of their angry mood, and then all that delicious choleric potential goes away," says Senior Narrative Designer Arone LeBray.</p>
<p>This dev diary is now the 21st diary released by Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room, providing a wealth of information about the importance of character customization and making sure you know how to dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>
