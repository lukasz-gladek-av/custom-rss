			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>
