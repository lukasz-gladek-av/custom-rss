			<p>Today, Wired Productions and Shanghai-based indie developer Pollard Studio have announced the release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The upcoming first-person psychological thriller game will be available on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/karma_the_dark_world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-dark-world-karma-3921c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) starting March 27, priced at $24.99. Pre-orders will be able to enjoy a 10% discount on either platform, and owners of a prior Wired Productions title on Steam can get an extra 10% off.</p>
<p>The game will also be enhanced on PlayStation 5 Pro thanks to full-featured PSSR integration, which will enhance image quality, definition, and texture clarity—along with improved reflections and distance rendering—providing what is being described as 'rock solid 60fps performance' at 4K resolution. An Xbox version is also being developed and will launch later.</p>
<p>Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Wired Productions has always championed storytellers who push the boundaries and craft compelling narratives. Yonghe Wang and Pollard Studio team have raised the bar and have delivered a rollercoaster assault on the senses, in an abstract, surreal, dark yet hauntingly beautiful cinematic gaming masterpiece. If Kojima, Christopher Nolan and the late and great David Lynch ever had the chance to work on a project from China, KARMA: The Dark World might just be the end result.</em></p>

<p>KARMA: The Dark World is a first-person psychological thriller game set in a dystopian alternate East Germany in 1984. In this time and place, the Leviathan Corporation rules with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, social class rules, mind-altering drugs and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who serve.</p>
<p>Players will become Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau. Using advanced technology to enter the minds of the accused, they will investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings back to Leviathan.</p>

			<p>The latest versions of the Unreal Engine 5 feature systems designed to prevent shader compilation issues, but they reportedly don't work well without additional work from developers.</p>
<p>During their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over a recent <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/game-engines-and-shader-stuttering-unreal-engines-solution-to-the-problem">blog post</a> shared by Epic on the Unreal Engine official website detailing why shader caching stuttering issues occur, highlighting how the shader compilation process designed in the past reached a breaking point in Direct3D 11 with the increase in shader code, and how it was addressed in modern APIs like Direct3D 12 and Vulkan with the introduction of PSOs, Pipeline State Objects, which opened up a lot of other issues, even in Unreal Engine despite the engine providing solutions for developers to compile PSOs so that game performance isn't impacted which continue to be worked on and improved. The blog post also addresses the misconception that shader compilation stuttering issues were introduced in DirectX 12, as they are a result of the increased shader code and general complexity, rather than anything the API has introduced over the previous version.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, these systems Epic introduced to reduce stuttering issues reportedly don't function as intended without developers' intervention. According to what technically-minded developers have told Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia, these systems don't work properly from Unreal Engine 5.1 to 5.4 and require specialized work to actually make them function as intended. Still, Digital Foundry found what Epic has outlined in the blog post, such as addressing Global Shaders issues which cause a lot of issues in a lot of games, and working with hardware and software vendors to adapt drivers and graphics APIs very promising, so hopefully, future versions of the engine will provide better experiences on PC than the current versions do.</p>

<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5, which introduces an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights called <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">MegaLights</a>, Sequencer improvements, and much more. You can learn more about this version of the game engine on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">official website.</a></p>
