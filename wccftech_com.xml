<p>This month, NVIDIA also added a few extra games to the library compared to the original plans for February, including the Batman: Arkham games (the first step for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-wb-games-titles-starting-with-batman-arkham-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. Games' renewed support of GeForce NOW</a>), Far Cry: New Dawn via PC Game Pass, F1 Manager 2024 via the Epic Games Store, and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trade via PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>On another note, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1iz2xas/membership_updates_free_1month_and_6month_options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update on its transition to an internal payment processing system. According to a representative, starting today, new members are once again going to be able to sign up for GeForce NOW, whether they are planning on a free, 1-month or 6-month membership. These memberships will be available in the US, Canada, and Europe. New members can sign up using a credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. However, there's no update yet on existing GeForce NOW members being able to make changes to their current membership. As a reminder, in the meantime, they can enjoy free gaming without billing.</p>

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con grip and the very first look at the console's charger have come today thanks to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>As shared on the&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year and provided some new images of the dock <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> also shared a few hours ago some new pictures of the Joy-Con grip and the new console's charger. While the Joy-Con grip looks identical to the current one, although the model shared in the picture may be incomplete as it's not clear how it would hold the Joy-Con controllers in place, the charger is definitely different from the one of the current Switch models, as it is generally a little smaller with only a slightly bigger width, according to some rough measurements provided by user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>. The most interesting thing about the charger, however, is that no cable is visible in the model provided by the Chinese leaker, so there's the chance that it could have a detachable cable.</p>
<p>While this isn't exactly the news fans are looking forward to hearing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, it's still nice to be able to learn more about the system before the floodgates open for real on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd</a>, when the Japanese company will host a dedicated Nintendo Direct to provide more information on the system. In addition, the company will host several preview events around the world where players will be able to get hands-on time with the system before its launch. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but the system should be out before the end of summer, according to a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> former employee.</a></p>
