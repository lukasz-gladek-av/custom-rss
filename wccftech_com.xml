            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">on December 17, 2025</a>, Splitgate developer <strong>1047 Games</strong> relaunched Splitgate 2 as <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong>. The new title is meant to signify a fusion of the best of the first game and its maligned sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">after Splitgate 2's initial launch went terribly</a>, and 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">promised to "<em>make FPS great again</em>."</a></p>



<p>If you didn't know that Splitgate 2 had relaunched under its new moniker, or that it had relaunched at all, then don't worry; you're not alone. Arena Reloaded doesn't seem to have fared any better than Splitgate 2, at least according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">its concurrent player numbers on SteamDB</a>. The game <strong>currently struggles to hit 1k concurrent players,</strong> and two days after some publications reported on those poor numbers, 1047 Games has taken it upon itself to respond.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">In a statement posted to its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the caption reads, "<em>1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations</em>," almost like it was trying to write a headline for publications to use. The statement goes on to begin with, "<em>Steam Charts don't measure fun</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible. To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day. And to everyone who hasn't</em> <em>played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The thing is, 1047 Games is absolutely right. It's not the best thing to get stuck in the weeds of SteamDB numbers when it comes to multi-platform games. Those numbers are only showing one platform, and we can't even take it as a proper read of PC players because Arena Reloaded is also available on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox don't share concurrent player numbers, so we can't really know how popular the game is outside of Steam. And SteamDB charts are only ever worth keeping an eye on when it comes to multiplayer games; they absolutely do not matter for single-player titles. </p>



<p>With all that said, if 1047 Games felt the need to make a statement like this, that can't be a sign that things are actually going fine internally when the team looks at its player numbers. If its numbers on Steam were low, but on consoles, it has thousands or even hundreds of thousands of players each day, then why care about chatter surrounding a platform that isn't the one your community is on? Some games are more popular on PC, while others are more popular on consoles.</p>



<p>So yes, SteamDB charts are never the full picture and anyone claiming that Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is dead in the water based solely on those numbers doesn't have all of the facts. But making a statement like this two days after initial reports of the low numbers seems more like an attempt to keep Splitgate in the news as much as possible, hoping more people will remember that it exists and give it a chance.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, of course, but if Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's concurrent player numbers on Steam are an accurate representation of how unpopular the game currently is, and the dire straits it is in, then that also feels like the exact kind of thing you would do if you were desperate for anyone to play your game.</p>



<p>Let us know below if we've got the situation completely wrong, and you're playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on your console or PC.</p>

			<p>While heavy hitters like <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/"><strong>Tekken 8</strong></a></em>, and <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> will continue to be updated with new characters and balance changes, which should be even more interesting for the <strong>Bandai Namco</strong> game following series creator Katsuhiro Harada's departure, 2026 will also see the release of some major fighting games. This is set to make it a landmark year for the fighting game community, particularly for those interested in <strong>tag fighting games</strong>.</p>



<p>Luckily, <strong>2026 will also offer plenty to those who prefer traditional 1-versus-1 fighting games</strong> with the launch of a new game based on a successful franchise and a massive overhaul of one of the best fighting games of the current console generation.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong>five most anticipated fighting games</strong> launching in 2026.</p>

<p>If you checked out our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">best fighting games of 2025 list</a></strong>, you may find the inclusion of 2XKO in this list weird. However, there's a good reason why the tag fighter set in the world of League of Legends is also one of the most anticipated fighting games launching in 2026.</p>



<p>After years in development as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Project L</em> and its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC early access release</strong></a>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">2XKO</em> officially launches <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">its console versions and full Season 1 this January</a></strong>. This free-to-play 2v2 tag-team fighter is built from the ground up to be accessible yet competitive, featuring some deep tag mechanics that provide players with a lot of options and a "Duo Play" mode that allows four players to compete at once. </p>



<p>Launching alongside a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026 Competitive Series</strong> featuring 20 sanctioned tournaments, Riot is positioning <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2XKO</em></strong> to be the next big pillar of the fighting game community. And with the developer knowing more than a few things about supporting a competitive game for years, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">2XKO</em> is likely here to stay for a very long time.</p>

<p>While not a "new" game in the traditional sense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arc System Works</strong> has confirmed that 2026 will see the launch of<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/"><strong>Guilty Gear -Strive-</strong></a> Version 2.0</em>, a massive overhaul that will reportedly be rather big.</p>



<p>This substantial shift in gameplay philosophy, as described by producer Ken Miyauchi, will coincide with the start of&nbsp;Season 5,&nbsp;which is expected to introduce additional characters following the addition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners'</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lucy</strong> to the roster in late 2025.</p>



<p>With new universal mechanics, reworked move sets for the base roster, and a significant graphical improvement to enhance what are some of the best visuals seen in fighting games, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Guilty Gear -Strive- Version 2.0</em> has every right to be among the most anticipated fighting games of the year.</p>
