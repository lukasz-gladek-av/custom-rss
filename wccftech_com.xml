			<p>Warhorse has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> official mod support&nbsp;<span>for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 soon, but in the meantime, modders continue to find ways to improve the highly successful first-person open world role-playing game that just celebrated selling</span>&nbsp;two million units in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>Nexus user nimbul recently <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a utility mod that loads configuration (CFG) variables correctly even after level loading. Without it, the game reverts to default variables. Thanks to this mod, Nexus user vktrfly worked on those variables to improve the global illumination quality in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with great results</a>, as you can see in the screenshots and the footage below.</p>

<p>According to the modder, the following two variables can be used to further enhance indirect lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>e_svoTI_DiffuseConeWidth = 4 ; Reduces light leak, default is 8</li>
<li>e_svoTI_NumberOfBounces = 2 ; Medium performance impact. Default is 2 at Ultra and above</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter can go up to 3 but will have a greater performance impact and may not be worth it, according to the author. Still, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely well optimized</a>, so users with the latest GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards may be tempted to try it - especially if they are subscribed to PureDark's Patreon and can, therefore, access his DLSS Multi Frame Generation mod for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>

<p>There is a downside, however: this global illumination mod cannot be used in conjunction with the previously covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Async Compute mod</a>. The author wrote:</p>
<p><em>If you encounter strobing, flickering, or pulsing lighting effects, they are not caused by this mod. Make sure you are not using AsyncCompute Enabler and e_svoTI_AsyncCompute = 1 is not in your user.cfg. AsyncCompute causes issues with global illumination, and Enhanced GI makes those issues extremely apparent.</em></p>
<p>Warhorse is currently preparing <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's first free content update</a>. Scheduled to launch in Spring, it will add barbers to change Henry's look, horse racing, and a proper Hardcore mode. Later this year, three premium DLCs will also be released.</p>
