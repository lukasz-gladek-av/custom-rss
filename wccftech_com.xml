			<p>Romero Games, the studio founded ten years ago by DOOM series creator John Romero and his weife Brenda, confirmed its next unannounced project is no longer in the works, and the project's cancellation is related to the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">wave of Xbox layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>In a new message shared on <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">X</a>, the studio confirmed that their unnamed publisher has canceled funding for their game alongside several other unannounced projects at other studios. This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher and above the studio's visibility and control. The decision to cancel the project, the message continues, does not in any way reflect the team's work, performance, or quality of the project. Development was reportedly proceeding well, but this wasn't enough to avoid the project from being canned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Romero Games' message doesn't mention the publisher's name, a message shared on X by the studio's former hard surface artist, Christoph Redl, confirms that the project's cancellation is a consequence of the recent wave of Xbox layoffs.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I’ve lost my position at Romero Games.</p><p>I’m now actively looking for new opportunities as a Prop Artist, Hard Surface Artist, or 3D Artist.<br>I'm open to both in-house and remote roles and excited to bring my skills to a new team. <a href="https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b">https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b</a></p></div>— Christoph Redl (@christophredl94) <a href="https://twitter.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the message above, Romero Games' new project is not the only one that has been canceled as a result of this week's Xbox layoffs, and a lot of studios have been impacted, from Forza Motorsport series developer<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/"> Turn 10</a>, which was hit hard with over 70 employees having been laid off, to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Zenimax Online</a>, whose new MMORPG has been canceled, and Perfect Dark's developer The Initiative, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">shut down</a> following the cancellation of its highly anticipated project.</p>

			<p>Proper usage of the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler can make the Nintendo Switch 2 punch well above its weight in terms of image quality and even surpass the Xbox Series S, as highlighted by the excellent work CAPCOM has done with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> port.</p>



<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series which debuted on PC and consoles two years back, highlighting how NVIDIA DLSS does a great job upscaling the image to 1080p in docked mode from the low base resolution of 540p. Though there are some issues like visible aliasing and flicker when characters reveal the background, the end results are considered better in terms of sharpness and image stability than those produced by CAPCOM's in-house upscaler used in the Xbox Series S version, which renders at native 1080 but doesn't handle image noise well. The Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game also beats the Xbox Series S release in terms of texture quality, despite the minor 1 GB differences in available RAM in favor of the Nintendo system. In other cases, however, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is closer to the PlayStation 4 release with no screen space reflections in Fighting Ground matches, missing depth of field, background NPC counts restricted to the standard setting, and non-interactive physics-based particles. In handheld mode, with a lower 360p base resolution upscaled to 720p and additional graphics cutbacks to keep the 60 FPS target, the game is even closer to the PlayStation 4 version, which is still rather impressive, for a handheld.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though obviously more powerful than its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving with some of its launch titles and upgrades to original Switch games what it is capable of achieving. The Splatoon 3 upgrade is particularly impressive, as it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">increases resolution by five to six times</a> in certain scenarios while keeping the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, making playing the third entry in the series on the system the way to go to enjoy it at its very best.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-bet-on-the-wrong-horse-with-subscriptions-says-analyst-following-latest-round-of-layoffs.1234881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The main takeaway from the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">layoffs</a> may well be that Xbox is losing its multi-year battle to dominate the gaming industry with Game Pass.</p>



<p>It was in October 2017's earnings call with investors that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-game-pass-netflix-games/">told</a> the world that the company sought to replicate Netflix's success with a similar subscription service for gaming. Game Pass had launched a few months earlier, but Sadella's statement made it crystal clear that the company would go all-in with that plan.</p>



<p>To lure more users to Game Pass, Microsoft spent a lot of money acquiring new Xbox studios starting in 2018: Ninja Theory, Compulsion Games, Playground Games, Undead Labs, inXile Entertainment, Obsidian Entertainment, and, in 2019, Double Fine. All their games would launch day one on Game Pass, making it a very enticing proposition for consumers. </p>



<p>Over time, though, the Xbox division realized that this wouldn't be enough to convince dozens of millions of users to subscribe. To make a real impact, Microsoft decided to open its wallet and spend $76.2 billion in the consecutive record-breaking acquisitions of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, two of the biggest publishers in the industry. That gave them access to intellectual properties like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, and many more.</p>



<p>However, it quickly became clear that such franchises could not be confined to a single console platform, never mind a flailing one such as the Xbox. They would lose a lot of money by not putting those games on PlayStation and even Nintendo consoles. This led to the multi-platform strategy that a lot of fans have complained about lately.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Game Pass growth <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stagnated</a> well below Microsoft's lofty ambitions. Despite the overtures of Xbox executives, the subscription service still isn't allowed on Sony or Nintendo platforms, and its growth on Xbox consoles has reached the point of full saturation. PC Game Pass is growing, but it's not enough to get where Microsoft wanted, and cloud gaming hasn't taken off nearly as much as originally believed.</p>



<p>To delve deeper into the causes of this failed bid from one of the tech industry leaders, we reached out to our good friend Rhys Elliott (Head of Market Analysis at <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/">Alinea</a>), who shared with us some thoughts, chiefly that subscriptions just aren't a good fit for gaming.</p>



<p><em>Like many industries, gaming overextended itself following the black swan event that was the COVID-19 pandemic. During those difficult times, everybody was at home, interest rates were low, and engagement with – and spending on – games skyrocketed. The growth-at-all costs mindset became dangerous. Many companies thought that double-digit growth would continue, greenlighting risky projects and strategies and going on M&amp;A sprees. But the market is very different now, and many moves ultimately did not pan out. The games market has reached its maturity phase. Now, inflation rates are high, money is considerably more expensive to borrow (for consumers and companies alike), there is a cost-of-living crisis, and publishers have been forced to lay off employees and adapt to this new normal. But with Xbox, there is more at play.</em></p>



<p><em>The Xbox One was the beginning of those troubles, and Xbox has been in a constant state of recovery ever since. The Game Pass strategy was Xbox’s main remedy, but the games never arrived with the impact needed. Xbox bet on the wrong horse with subscriptions. Many proclaimed that subscriptions would become the de-facto way consumers access game content, just like Spotify, Netflix, and the like are ruling distribution in music and video. Despite companies’ best efforts, subscriptions will not be the main method of game distribution. For now, consumers – and the market – have spoken.</em></p>



<p><em>The reasoning is clear: the attention economy is already oversaturated, and consuming game content is more demanding than other mediums. A consumer can:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Listen to hundreds of tracks on Spotify each month</em></li>



<li><em>Watch dozens of movies / TV episodes</em></li>



<li><em>But the majority only has time to play a few games maximum – and that extends to even highly engaged players</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is just the tip of the iceberg about why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Most gamers are already served by the free-play markets</em></li>



<li><em>Others are happy to buy a few premium games a year</em></li>



<li><em>Xbox was also following that trend on console despite a recent boost from adding Call of Duty to Game Pass, the service's new baseline</em></li>



<li><em>Subscriptions with day-one launch games are good for consumers, but they cannibalise game sales on Xbox’s core platform. And stagnating growth in that strategy has led Xbox to shift its strategy towards becoming a third-party publisher.</em></li>



<li><em>Another wrinkle is that Microsoft’s acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard were meant to reshape its gaming business. And they have – just not in the way many imagined. Xbox is now a giant publisher, with a back catalogue that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Fallout and many more. But the division is in flux, caught between its historic role as a console platform and a future that is increasingly platform-agnostic – third party. Whether this results in a more successful Xbox, or simply a more diluted one, remains to be seen. But I am not optimistic, truthfully. The Xbox of old is fading, and it’s sadly come with casualties. Too many casualties.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There's little doubt that Game Pass has so far failed to be as relevant as Microsoft had hoped. There are just too many games on the market, and more and more of those games are continuing to get content for years after launch, stealing attention away from the new titles. There just isn't enough time to play all this content. Quality, not quantity, will win and get away with increasing premium prices. But let's face it, Microsoft never really managed to shine with quality games.</p>



<p>That is not to say Xbox is dead, but as others have noted, Xbox as we knew it is certainly dead, and its Game Pass push hasn't gone well enough to meet estimates. Furthermore, it was Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-championed-game-pass-even-against-his-own-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">championed</a> Game Pass at all costs, even against internal concerns. However, despite rumors to the contrary, it doesn't appear that he'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">retiring</a> from his position any time soon.</p>
