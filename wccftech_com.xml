			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is far from being the only entry in the series to offer multiple playable characters, but the differences between the characters have never been as big as they are in Shadows. Naoe and Yasuke are very different characters who excel at very different things, and their unique abilities determine how you should approach the many challenges the game offers.</p>

<p>In many ways, <strong>Naoe embodies the traditional Assassin's Creed series playstyle</strong>. Extremely agile, the shinobi from Iga is the fastest playable character, can climb on buildings and mountains with ease thanks to the grappling hook only she can use, and has every tool you may need to infiltrate enemy strongholds and remain in the shadows undetected, such as kunai for long range kills, and smoke bombs to conceal her presence. If it comes to a fight, Naoe can hold her own reasonably well but requires perfect play due to her low health, which makes her almost always a few steps away from death, especially at Expert difficulty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the second Assassin's Creed Shadows protagonist, <strong>Yasuke</strong>, is extremely <strong>good in combat</strong>. Not only does he have tons of health that allow you to make some mistakes and still survive, but he also has a lot of great combat options with amazing weapon variety - three melee and two ranged options - and plenty of Adrenaline right from the get-go that makes it easier for him to use skills. By advancing on the dedicated skill tree of each weapon type, Yasuke can become a killing machine that can even fight multiple enemies at once with extreme ease, especially with a naginata equipped. All this combat power, however, comes at a cost. Yasuke is not only much slower than Naoe but is also far less agile, meaning that using parkour is almost always not an option for him. He is meant to face enemies head-on, fully embodying the direct combat playstyle that was much the focus in Asssassin's Creed Valhalla, although he can still be stealthy by taking enemies from afar with the bow.</p>

<p>With the two Assassin's Creed Shadows main characters featuring very different playstyles, which of the two is the better character to play the vast majority of the time? <strong>The answer to this question depends on how you want to approach the game</strong>. Playing as Naoe will allow you to play the game as if it were any of the classic Assassin's Creed games which placed great emphasis on stealth gameplay and killing enemies undetected. The vast majority of main quest missions have been designed to allow you to take full advantage of Naoe's superior parkour, making a stealth approach extremely satisfying most of the time. At the same time, given Naoe's low health, you will be forced to play slowly to avoid making mistakes, getting discovered, and then forced into an all-out battle which Naoe may have trouble surviving. Yasuke, on the other hand, can literally barge into enemy strongholds from the front entrance, take on every enemy that confronts him, and easily survive the vast majority of fights. This approach is also the fastest to clear enemy camps and strongholds, which also means you will be able to get your hands on powerful Legendary equipment more quickly using him.</p>
<p>No matter who you choose,<strong> every quest in Assassin's Creed Shadows can be completed without too much trouble at the normal difficulty settings</strong>, so don't agonize too much over which character is the best to use. Get acquainted with both of them and pick the one you have the most fun with, with the knowledge that, at times, you will be forced to use the other in specific quests.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-update-0-5-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-increased-storage/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Palworld developer Pocketpair&nbsp;<span><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 0.5, which adds</span>&nbsp;major features like cross-play between all platforms, a Photo Mode, and increased storage.</p>
<p><em>▼New Content</em><br>
<em>・Crossplay!</em><br>
<em>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>・Global Palbox</em><br>
<em>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</em></p>
<p><em>・Dimensional Pal Storage</em><br>
<em>⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</em></p>
<p><em>・Cosmetic Armour System!</em><br>
<em>⤷ You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character’s appearance without affecting armour stats!</em></p>
<p><em>・Photo Mode</em><br>
<em>⤷ Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</em></p>
<p><em>・Drafting Table</em><br>
<em>⤷ Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</em></p>
<p>There's also the addition of dedicated servers for the Mac version of Palworld, as well as plenty of balance adjustments and tweaks, bug fixes, and UI improvements. However, the team also said that dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version aren't currently available, though they are working on adding support in the future.</p>
<p>After last year's explosive launch of the game, its success has slowed down, although it still reached the incredible number of 32 million players earlier this year. However, Pocketpair's plans got a big wrench stuck in them when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit for patent infringement. Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley talked at GDC 2025 (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Gamesradar</a>) about how shocking it was for the studio to find this out:</p>
<p><em>This obviously came as a shock to us. I think it came as a shock to a lot of people because it's alleged patent infringement, which is something that no one even considered, and it's something that we're still hashing out basically. It didn't feel good, obviously. We were pretty vocal before Palworld released that we did legal checks before the game released, and they were all cleared - in Japan. So obviously, when the lawsuit was announced, we were all like, 'What?'</em></p>
<p><em>And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts, and they said, 'what's going on,' and that's when we discovered it was patents that they were going for. Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so a pretty depressing day, a lot of people kind of head-down walking home in the rain. It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version. We were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show. Obviously, we had to kind of scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that. But yeah, the short answer is it did not feel good.</em></p>

			<p>Earlier this week, 4A Games <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new blog post</a> on its official website to celebrate the Metro franchise's 15th anniversary. Following up on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier statement from a couple of years back</a>, the development team openly said that the next installment will be much darker because of the Ukraine-Russia War:</p>
<p><em>In 2022, a full-scale Russian invasion changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game. As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make.</em></p>
<p><em>Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war, and often emotional story - and you can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky. Dmitry has always <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-writer-is-on-russias-wanted-list-for-his-anti-war-stance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against the war in Ukraine from the start</a> – a courageous decision for any russian, that has seen him <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-series-author-dmitry-glukhovsky-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced to jail (in absentia)</a> - and we are proud to have him as a friend and co-creator as we tell this next, and never more relevant chapter of Metro together. Rest assured, you are in for quite the ride.</em></p>
<p>The development team also shared an update on their current status. 4A Games is now composed of over 200 members, 150 of whom are still in Kyiv, while the rest are located in the studio's headquarters in Sliema, Malta. Besides Metro, 4A Games is also working on an unannounced intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian developers are inevitably still impacted by the war, and as such, they asked fans to manage expectations when it comes to the reveal of the next Metro: it will be ready when it's ready. Indeed, it's already been over six years since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Exodus</a>, and it sounds like we'll have to wait a while yet before we hear anything concrete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Quimera</a>, a sci-fi first-person shooter game in development at Reburn, formerly 4A Games Ukraine and now completely independent of 4A Games.</p>
