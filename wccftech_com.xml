			<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot answered several questions during the company's General Meeting 2025 held earlier this month (a recording is available <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, though you'll have to register first to access it).</p>



<p>The executive addressed hot topics related to Ubisoft, such as the commercial failure of Star Wars Outlaws, which he blamed largely on the IP's current woes:</p>



<p><em>For Star Wars Outlaws, we didn't reach our sales targets. The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand - the brand that it belonged to - was in 'choppy waters'. And the game had a few items that still needed to be polished, and they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes. We did heavily improve the game after those early weeks, and when it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, it will have a new version of the game.  </em></p>



<p>Guillemot refers to the fact that some Star Wars products that were released immediately before Star Wars Outlaws did not perform well. Chiefly, he might be referring to The Acolyte, which aired between June and July 2024 and was already canceled in August due to low viewership.</p>



<p>It's hard to imagine The Acolyte having such a big impact on Star Wars Outlaws sales, though. After all, other live action TV series like The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka had much better reception among fans. Much more accurate is the other half of Guillemot's statement, where the Ubisoft CEO admits that the game launched with several problems that were only ironed out over the course of the following months. Perhaps the game, in its current, improved state, will find a new audience on the Nintendo Switch 2, where it is scheduled to launch on September 4.</p>



<p>In the General Meeting 2025, the Ubisoft CEO also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games initiative</a>:</p>



<p><em>Regarding the petition, we operate in a market and whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7. So, we provide information regarding the game and how long the game can be played. Players and buyers are forewarned that the game may be discontinued. </em></p>



<p><em>[...] This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft. All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players, because obviously, support for old games cannot last forever. But that's an issue that we're working on, and it's something that the industry at large is working on to minimize impact on players. But clearly, it's something that you need to factor in. The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there is a service component, eventually the services may be discontinued because the software may become obsolete over time. </em></p>

			<p>The Battlefield 6 open beta may go live in around two weeks, judging from some recent discoveries shared online today.</p>



<p>As reported on the Battlefield series subreddit, members of the 1BF Telegram group discovered via the API of EA's backend services that the publication of the Battlefield 6 open beta build spotted earlier this month is scheduled for August 4. The open beta itself may not become available on the same day, but the fact that it is being published suggests that it should go live not too long after its publication. In addition, it has been discovered that this open beta build is five numbers ahead of the latest Battlefield Labs beta, meaning that it should sport plenty of improvements and possibly some new features not found in the latest testing build. The launch of the open beta will likely be preceded by the announcement of the game's release date and opening of pre-orders, as, according to another redditor, an <em>"early open beta access"</em> line has been discovered in the API, continuing the trend of pre-orders granting early access to beta tests.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 open beta becoming available in early August also falls in line with rumors of EA hosting a three-day event later this month for media and creators. The event is said to also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/">live reveal</a> in the vein of the Battlefield 1 reveal, which also included live gameplay besides the official announcement. As such, it looks like it won't take long to finally see more of the next entry in the long-running series and how it will attempt to achieve its ambitious target of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">100 million players.</a></p>

			<p>Another game is soon joining the small lineup of PlayStation 5 Pro targeting native 8K resolution and 60 frames per second gameplay.</p>



<p>Pure Pool Pro, sequel to 2014's Pure Pool by Ripstone Games revealed today with a new trailer, will reportedly run at native 8K resolution and 60 frames per second on Sony's mid-generation refresh system, and at native 4K resolution and 120 frames per second on the base model. In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/ps5-pro-pockets-a-native-8k-60fps-game">Push Square</a>, Ripstone Games' George Holland provided some additional information on the matter, saying that the nature of the pool being fixed around the table, their relatively lightweight proprietary engine and their initial pre-alpha testing before any optimization led the team to believe that 8K@60 FPS on the PlayStation 5 Pro is achievable.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, Pure Pool Pro will be joining a small lineup of games targeting 8K resolution on the system. Among them are <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-gran-turismo-7-pssr-8k/">Gran Turismo 7</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a>, but neither of them can run at native 8K resolution on the system, instead taking advantage of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler to reconstruct a lower resolution, usually in the ballpark of 4K resolution, to 8K. Considering how 8K displays aren't widespread, not too many players are able to enjoy these few PlayStation 5 Pro games at 8K resolution, but having more options is never a bad thing.</p>



<p>Besides allowing developers to implement 8K modes in their games, the PlayStation 5 Pro has a lot to offer over the base model, as its higher specs than the base model can offer the same image quality seen in Quality display modes at 60 frames per second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new entry in the Fire Emblem series may be in the works for Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a recent online discovery.</p>



<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAPgmb2p7L8">Doctre81</a>, a veteran Japanese 3D character modeler who has worked with Square Enix, SEGA, and Cygames, among other publishers, revealed on LinkedIn that they have worked from January 2025 until April 2025 on the "sequel of Nintendo's SRPG (tactical role-playing game) on Switch 2". While the 3D character modeler hasn't mentioned the name of the game, or the series it belongs to, there's a very good chance this sequel is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, as the other notable tactical role-playing series by the Japanese company, Advance Wars, hasn't seen a new entry in a very long time, and it may not be as popular nowadays as to warrant a sequel, considering how Advance Wars 1+2: Re‑Boot Camp did not set the sales charts on fire. The fact that the 3D character modeler only worked for a few months in the game may also suggest this isn't a new entry in the series, but possibly a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for one of the Fire Emblem games released on the original Switch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this sequel a new Fire Emblem game for Nintendo Switch 2?</figcaption></figure>



<p>It has been some time since we saw a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, so a new game launching on Nintendo Switch 2 would make many fans quite happy, especially those who didn't exactly like the latest entry in the franchise, Fire Emblem Engage. The game launched in 2023 features very solid gameplay, bringing back some classic mechanics, but its mixed bag of character designs, disappointing storyline, and trite social elements left something to be desired. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-second-expansion-is-unlikely-to-launch-in-2025-%E2%80%93-rumor.1248650/</guid>

			<p>A second Starfield DLC expansion continues to be in the works, but it may not launch this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A few days back, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed on the ResetERA forums that Bethesda isn't quite done with its latest role-playing game, as another DLC is in the works, but it doesn't seem like it will release in 2025 at this point. While this may be disappointing for those who are eagerly awaiting a reason to return to Starfield, if the expansion is taking longer to develop than the Shattered Space expansion, which launched only one year after the base game, it could mean that it will be way more substantial than the first expansion.</p>



<p>The Starfield Shattered Space limited scope was hardly the only issue of the expansion. While the introduction of a more focused storyline was very welcome, the expansion left a lot to be desired, as the average map and quest design and the lack of new features turn it into a slog fast, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, the new expansion, which is rumored to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>, will introduce the new features and tweaks Starfield needs to become a much better game.</p>



<p>Starfield and the Shattered Space expansions are now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. A PlayStation 5 port of the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">rumored</a> to be in the works, and despite earlier indications suggesting its announcement would be imminent, has yet to be officially revealed.</p>
