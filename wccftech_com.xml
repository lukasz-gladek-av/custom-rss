			<p>Despite lacking TPM 2.0 support, the old AMD FX-9590 CPU is capable of running Battlefield 6, and even at playable framerates.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FullyBuffered">Fully Buffered</a> attempted to run the latest entry in the series by EA on two old CPUs, the Intel Core i7-2600K and the aforementioned AMD FX-9590. While the game wouldn't launch on the Intel CPU due to the lack of Secure Boot support, the AMD CPU could launch and run the game, having Secure Boot support. As such, it seems like not supporting TPM 2.0 doesn't prevent a CPU from running the game, as lacking SecureBoot support does.</p>



<p>Although the AMD FX-9590 is an old CPU released over 10 years ago, it runs Battlefield 6 surprisingly well, paired with an RX 5700 8 GB GPU. In Conquest mode with a total of 64 players, the game runs at a mid-30s FPS range, occasionally reaching the 40s range at 1080p resolution, which is very impressive for an older CPU. In other game modes, and by lowering the resolution, the game even hits the mid-40s range. Unsurprisingly, all of the CPU's core are pushed to their limit to run the game, hitting 98% utilization at 4,65 GHz.</p>

<p>An old CPU, such as the AMD FX-9590, running Battlefield 6 as well as it does, confirms the greater attention the development team put into optimizing the game and ensuring it could run well even on low-spec systems. Before the game launched, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that <span>among the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/" target="_blank">a substantial number were on minimum specs or below.</a>&nbsp;Therefore, it was essential</span> for the team to optimize for these low specs to ensure all players could enjoy the game. Overcoming the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S also made <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Battlefield 6 a better game from a technical standpoint.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, one of the best games in 2025, and one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/">games contending for game of the year</a> is going to be <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/play-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-for-free-this-weekend-on-steam">free for players to try on Steam and Xbox Series X/S starting today</a>, November 6, 2025, until this coming Monday, November 10, 2025. This free weekend comes just ahead of the launch of its third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae, which launches on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Along with the free weekend, if you do decide to grab the full game, then you'll get it at a 40% off discount on both Steam and Xbox, though PlayStation fans seem to be left out of the fun, as there is no mention of a free weekend for PlayStation or a discount on PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>When Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 released at the beginning of this year in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's reviewer, Chris Wray, gave the game a 10/10, writing</a>, "<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will launch together with the Valley of Memory expansion to introduce gameplay changes and new features, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/62bserGVoUbHQPrsGCasOU/assassins-creed-mirage-new-gameplay-features-and-valley-of-memory-expansion">The new update</a> launching together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/">the free expansion on November 18</a> on all formats will introduce some brand new features, starting with the ability to replay all black box missions and contracts after they have been cleared once. Each replayable mission presents distinct challenges that require players to approach these missions creatively, such as avoiding the use of Eagle Vision, targeting only the main enemy, and more. Completing these missions grants the player exclusive in-game rewards usable in New Game +.</p>



<p>The upcoming free Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also introduce a new free jump option that will allow players to jump manually, a new control scheme to smooth parkour that works better with free jump turned on, a Back and Side Ejects Mode, which allows Basim to perform ejects regardless of the presence of a safe landing spot and a few other parkous tweaks to make the experience smoother.</p>



<p>Finally, the new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also add a new skill called Engineer 2 that will allow him to equip all level 1 enhancements to his tools, and a new level 3 modification that will power up every tool. Rounding up the new features included in the update is the inclusion of new difficulty levels called Hardened Assassin, which will sport enemies with higher defense than Assassin difficulty, and Ultimate Assassin, the hardest difficulty in the game.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game which brought back the classic series' gameplay formula by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Nathan Birch's review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix is the latest video game publisher to push for AI usage in video game development, aiming to let it handle a critical part of development almost completely by 2027.</p>



<p>As part of the company's latest earnings report, the Japanese publisher shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Progress Report on its Medium-Term Business Plan</a>, detailing some of the initiatives underway to boost long-term growth, which include promoting AI utilization in Japan. This is being achieved through the initiation of joint research with the Matsu Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes using AI technology.</p>



<p>The current goal of this joint research project is to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027. This will <em>"improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development"</em>, Square Enix detailed in the report. As of now, the research team is composed of more than 10 people, including researchers from the Matsu-Iwasawa Laboratory and engineers from Square Enix.</p>



<p>While Square Enix has only started researching AI usage in QA, other publishers are already using it for their titles, putting testers' jobs at risk. Last month, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA has already been using AI in QA for a while</a>, as a former employee at Respawn confirmed that over 100 people were laid off last Spring because the company started using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, which was work previously handled by human employees.</p>



<p>Square Enix's plans to utilize AI to enhance game development efficiency appear to align with a prevailing sentiment among the most successful Japanese video game developers, such as Masahiro Sakurai and Hideo Kojima. Both developers are not averse to using AI to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">make large-scale game development sustainable</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">let it handle tedious tasks to allow them to focus on the creative process.</a></p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A has been out for three weeks at the time of this writing, and has had a stunning commercial start with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">5.8 million copies sold in its first week</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/">strong sales in both the UK and the US</a>. Continuing the momentum, today, The Pokémon Company announced that the game's first paid DLC, Mega Dimension, will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices this coming December 10, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came with two new trailers, one that's more of a cinematic showcase of the new DLC, and another that goes into more detail about Mega Dimension and lays out what to expect in the paid expansion.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As shown in the cinematic trailer above, Mega Dimension marks a historic change for the Pokémon series, which is that the level cap for Pokémon, which has been at level 100 for the entire history of the series, has been removed, and you'll now have to face Pokémon far, far stronger than level 100.</p>



<p>The DLC begins with the introduction of a new character, Ansha and her partner Pokémon, Hoopa. They pull you into a new dimension and a new version of Lumiose City that has new versions of Pokémon running around the city, but you're not just there to capture new Pokémon. You're also there to uncover a mystery behind distortions that are appearing across Lumiose City, with the help of Ansha and Hoopa.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Wccftech's review of Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, our reviewer Nathan Birch gave it an 8.5/10, and<em> </em>wrote, "<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em>"</p>
