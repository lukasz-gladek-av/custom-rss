			<p>Sony is working on AI-powered versions of PlayStation characters that can respond to voice input from the player during gameplay, a new leaked video revealed.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> by an anonymous tipster before it got taken down on YouTube, shows an AI-powered version of the Horizon series protagonist Aloy that can respond to queries using synthesized voice and facial movements both in a demo setting and during Horizon Forbidden West gameplay, as highlighted by SIE director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal who demonstrated the technology in the removed video. The technology, powered by OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations, is augmented by Sony's internal Emotional Voice Synthesis system and by Mockingbird technology that handles audio-to-face animation.</p>
<p>While this AI-powered version of Aloy was developed to show the technology internally, there's a very good chance that we will eventually see it implemented even on consoles, as parts of the technology can run directly on PlayStation 5 with little overhead. This glimpse of what the technology is capable of achieving doesn't exactly provide hints at how it could be implemented to enhance gaming experiences, but there's little doubt that it will impact future games considerably, considering the direction the industry is taking and how the PlayStation 6, in particular, is said will go <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">all-out on AI.</a></p>
<p>Sony isn't the only major console manufacturer investing heavily in AI. Last week, Microsoft unveiled its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse AI model</a> capable of generating gameplay. This&nbsp;should help developers, especially in the early stages of development, although the contrary is more likely, given the current state of the industry.</p>

			<p>Square Enix is planning to celebrate Chrono Trigger's 30th anniversary with various projects, according to a new post shared on social media today.</p>
<p>On the publisher's official Japanese <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5E28ba345c8804a38a6acfe4646e646ed32e8e603c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> profile, Square Enix highlighted how today, March 11th, marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Chrono Trigger, a dream project that brought together the creator of the Final Fantasy series Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Dragon Quest series Yuji Horii and the creator of Dragon Ball Akira Toriyama. To celebrate the game's 30th anniversary, the Japanese publisher is planning to launch various projects this year that will go beyond the world of the game to thank all those who have played the game.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger is among the few 16-bit-era JRPGs released by Square Enix that have yet to be properly remade. While the game was released with additional content on the Nintendo DS, which is also available in the Steam release, it was never effectively remade. Hopefully, in light of the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-already-sold-2-million-copies/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake</a> released last year, the Japanese publisher will consider at least an HD-2D remake of Chrono Trigger to introduce what is, in my opinion, one of the best JRPGs ever released, if not the very best, to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Chrono Trigger on modern gaming hardware is on PC with the aforementioned Steam release. The game launched in a rather poor state back in 2018 but has since been improved with <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-update-3/">new features and enhancements</a>, making this version one of the best ways to enjoy the classic game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>The WWE 2K franchise has been in a rebuilding phase for the past few years, culminating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year’s WWE 2K24</a>, which was one of the best pro grappling games 2K and developer Visual Concepts had delivered in years. But as most seasoned wrestling fans know, it’s one thing to prove you’re championship material; it’s another challenge altogether to stay at that elite level. That’s the test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> now faces.</p>
<p>Does WWE 2K25 continue the series’ upward momentum? Or does it make some unfortunate high-risk moves? It’s time to lace ‘em up again and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2520.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Over the past few years, the WWE 2K games have taken steps to refine their in-ring action, adding offensive maneuvers and new ways the change the momentum of matches beyond standard reversals, such as blocks, dodges, and “breakers.” In some respects, WWE 2K25 further polishes the between-the-ropes product – animations feel a bit smoother and some minor features, like being able to launch attacks from the ringside barriers, have been added. I’m also a fan of the new “Giant” fighting style, which grants those playing as one of the big boys (or girls) an extra bar of “armor.” Once the giant’s armor is worn down, they play more like a regular wrestler, and their limited invulnerability is balanced by them not being able to do certain more acrobatic moves. I wouldn’t mind seeing other WWE 2K wrestler archetypes updated to stand apart more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k259.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That said, WWE 2K25’s action also regresses in some ways. Blocking has been removed from the game, and while it was never something I used that much, it’s always disappointing to have something removed from your toolbox. The Chain Wrestling minigame has also been brought back, which I’m somewhat ambivalent about. Sure, the mechanic works well enough, but it isn’t particularly engaging, as it forces you to keep your attention on minigame meters instead of what your wrestler is actually doing for a significant amount of time. Overall, I still enjoyed the action in WWE 2K25, but I was left with a lingering feeling the series is taking a turn back toward gimmicks instead of faster action and fighting-game-style versatility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2519.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>WWE 2K25’s two new match types are also largely duds. The Underground match is an odd addition, as the COVID-19 era “Raw Underground” experiment it’s based on isn’t particularly well-remembered by anyone. The match itself isn’t anything special, essentially just removing the ring ropes and darkening the arena for your standard hardcore match. There isn’t even a dedicated Underground arena (the unique presentation of Raw Underground was one of the few memorable things about it).</p>
<p>The new Bloodline Rules match sounds promising in theory but is pretty underwhelming in practice. Basically, players have the ability to call in up to three run-ins per match, which can be countered by your opponent with their own run-ins. These allies don’t just run in and disappear, they stick around and often start fighting each other, resulting in an increasingly disorderly schmozz. The end result is quite the opposite of the carefully orchestrated “cinematic” matches that Roman Reigns has made his trademark.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k255.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the plus side, while the new match types aren’t terribly inspired, almost every type of match in the game can now be played with any mix of men and women as intergender wrestling makes its return. Of course, intergender wrestling is a divisive topic -- I’m not always a great fan of it in real life, but I’m also all for letting people have their fun within the largely consequence-free world of video games, and it can be switched off in the options.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2521.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visually, WWE 2K25 receives the standard minor glow-up the series gets every year. Lighting has been improved and the often Medusa-like hair physics of years past have finally been tamed. As usual, some Superstars look almost uncannily realistic, others not so much (even after Bayley herself directed some shade at last year’s game, she <em>still</em> doesn’t look quite right).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the core in-ring action, WWE 2K25 offers the usual array of ways to play and an all-new one – The Island. Similar to NBA 2K’s The City hub, The Island allows you to explore themed areas with other players, climb the rankings in online matches, make your way through a series of single-player “quests,” and, of course, spend money on cosmetics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2522.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I won’t sugarcoat it: The Island is a drag. While it looks nice enough, with references to various WWE Superstars – a Kairi Sane Pirate Princess restaurant here, a very random Damage CTRL computer repair shop there – almost none of it is interactive in any meaningful way. The quests you can engage with are as basic as they get – find a WWE wrestler somewhere on The Island, get treated to a very underwhelming static, text-based “cutscene,” have a match, then go find another wrestler, read more inane text, and have another match. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>The stories laid out in The Island’s quests are purely Saturday morning cartoon fare. You’ll find yourself doing things like constructing special “video game armor” for Xavier Woods so he can do battle with his gaming alter-ego, who has somehow come to life, or going on a time-traveling escapade with Rey Mysterio thanks to a magical lucha mask. Maybe this stuff actually sounds kinda kooky and fun to you, but trust me, it’s all presented in the dullest way possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2523.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And yes, of course, everything about The Island is tuned to maximize extra spending. In addition to the numerous in-game shops selling overpriced cosmetics (most things cost between 6,000 and 18,000 “VC,” meaning a single 32,500 VC pack costing $10 may only buy you two or three items) progressing your OVR is a slog, requiring <em>hours</em> of play to add a single point to your rating. Of course, when I tried to jump into some online matches mere minutes after The Island went live, I was almost exclusively matched up with guys with paid-for 100 OVRs. If you want to be competitive at all, you need to fork over for either an expensive special edition or VC packs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the effort Visual Concepts sunk into The Island seems to have had a knock-on effect on the rest of WWE 2K25, as the MyRise career mode is notably diminished this year. Rather than two individual stories for the men and women, they’re smushed into a single story, and instead of a more intricate system of missions and side missions, you simply get a main story and the ability to engage in filler “Live Event” matches.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2524.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The MyRise story, entitled “Mutiny,” is mostly nonsense. After your created character debuts in WWE, the very unlikely duo of Kevin Owens and Bayley stage a mutiny of NXT veterans, despite both of them having left the brand ages ago. The mutiny makes no sense, as 90 percent of WWE superstars from the past decade or more have come through NXT, so what, exactly, are they rebelling against? Today’s WWE star is the NXT star of a few years ago. The whole thing just feels random, with none of the alliances or characters making any sense if you watch WWE even casually. It's disappointing, because MyRise storytelling had really improved in recent years, with plots that actually played off WWE history and personalities in interesting ways, sometimes even cautiously challenging WWE narratives. That's nowhere to be found this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2525.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's not all bad news, though, as some modes do offer improvements. “The Bloodline’s Dynasty” 2K Showcase builds nicely on the positive upgrades the mode received last year, adding matches that let you change history and “dream” showdowns that never happened in the real world. This adds some much-needed variety to the Showcase experience, which sometimes felt like a bit of a grind in years past. New timed objectives during matches are somewhat less successful, but overall, this may be the best Showcase we’ve got to date.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2526.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>MyGM is largely the same as last year, and still suffers from not allowing you to pre-determine outcomes, but the addition of online play is unquestionably a big boost for those who do enjoy the mode. Universe mode offers the usual handful of annual updates, including the return of promos, and remains a solid, if dry, tool for fantasy bookers. The Ultimate-Team-style MyFaction mode also returns and continues to be an odd fit for a game with a roster of only a few hundred names to draw on. A new single-player mode and a few more match options for online play freshen things up a bit but don’t fundamentally change the MyFaction experience.</p>
<p>While WWE 2K games have always had their share of glitches, I encountered more than usual this year, and they weren’t just minor graphical bugs – full-on crashes on PS5 were fairly common. Some of these issues may have already been patched, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that WWE 2K25 is arriving in a messier state than its predecessor. Even with this lack of polish and some skippable modes, it still feels like WWE 2K25 offers a solid amount of content worth exploring. That said, if you opt to stick with a dependable veteran like WWE 2K24, you won’t be missing out on as much as in some past years.</p>

						<section>
				<p>WWE 2K25 doesn’t manage to build on the momentum created by the last few entries in the series. For every step forward, such as online MyGM or the varied Bloodline 2K Showcase, there’s a step back, like the lifeless MyRise career mode and some questionable changes to core gameplay. The biggest blemish is The Island hub, which excels at separating players from their money and not much else. There’s certainly still fun to be had with WWE 2K25, but the series risks dropping back to the midcard if it continues on this new trajectory.</p>

			<p>MercurySteam continues to share new details about Blades of Fire. In the span of a couple of weeks, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new info</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed PC system requirements</a>,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gets-lots-of-new-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and new gameplay footage</a>, and now there's a fresh interview with Gamereactor in which studio co-founder and game director Enric Alvarez <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/724323/Forging+a+New+World+-+Blades+of+Fire+Interview+with+Enric+Alvarez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the narrative structure. While a very narrative-driven game, Blades of Fire also provides the player with agency over</span>&nbsp;how much they really want to know about this world and its characters.</p>
<p><em>It might not look like it because of the freedom the game gives you, but it's a strongly narrative-driven game, and characters are the most important thing. Because you don't have a good story without good characters. So, when writing the story, we wanted to have a certain exposed narrative through cutscenes, other characters, etc., but we also wanted to have a kind of organic narrative, depending on how proactive you are. </em></p>
<p><em>The curiosity will drive you through important bits of the story. For example, there's two mechanics that you can talk to Adso anytime. One mechanic is, okay, tell me what you know about the mission you're accomplishing. And they will tell you vague stuff because they don't know everything about that. So, you, as a player, will know what they know.</em></p>
<p><em>And there's a second layer, which is, I want to talk about specific topics to Adso. You can stop at any time and say, hey, Adso, tell me about the forgers. Tell me about the hammers. Tell me about the master forgers, or about this castle, or about this new character we just found. All this requires your curiosity and active participation. There's a lot of narrative delivered in this way. I think between both, we have something quite cohesive and interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>In Blades of Fire, most of the story doesn't come for you. You have to go for it. You have to actively pursue wanting to know more. You'll find quite crazy characters in this game that will give you a different perspective on what's going on in the game and many surprises.</em></p>
<p>This new fantasy action/adventure game by MercurySteam is slated to launch in two months and a half, going live on May 22 for PC (only on the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>The Diablo IV <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24179278/the-2-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR)</a> goes live today for a week, allowing players to test the features that will be available in the next season. By far the most interesting is the fact that after defeating certain bosses, adventurers will be able to claim some of their powers for their own.</p>
<p>Blizzard said this is an attempt to increase build variety. In total, the current plan is that 24 of Sanctuary's bosses will be supported by the feature. Various world bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (see the article for more information), and even Lilith herself are among the diabolical titans offering Boss Powers.</p>
<p>Each of their powers has two effects, a main effect and a modifier effect, that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. Players can have up to one primary and three modifier powers active at any one time. The primary boss power you equip will be the star of the show, while the modifiers are designed to enhance your chosen Main Boss Power and take it to new heights.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of the supported Diablo IV bosses and their powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss Wandering Death)</li>
