			<p>Today, as part of their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/02/remedy-q4-2024-ir-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year 2024 financial report</a>, Remedy confirmed that Alan Wake 2 has finally surpassed two million units sold. As you might remember, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-forza-motorsport-alan-wake-2-npd-circana-october-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with sales</a> despite being critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Remedy CEO Virtala also revealed that the development and marketing costs have finally been recouped, and the developer has begun earning royalties for Alan Wake 2 towards the end of the last quarter. The executive credited the game's continued support with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake House expansions</a>, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro update</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry update</a>, and of course the retail version of Alan Wake 2, for helping push the sales of the horror game, especially during the latest Holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, revenue increased by 49.3% to â‚¬50 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Operating profit also improved compared to last year but remained negative. Still, Remedy is hopeful for the future, stating that 2025 will mark a new era of sustainable and stable growth. The Finnish developer has the ambitious goal of doubling the 2024 revenue by 2027 while retaining an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin of 30%.</p>
<p>Following Alan Wake 2, Remedy is now fully committed to its next projects, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which CEO Tero Virtala confirmed for a 2025 launch. The executive also said that in December, the development team successfully conducted a closed technical test with external players, testing the game's matchmaking and backend services and collecting data to shape the final game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> has just entered full production after establishing production pipelines and verifying asset creation speed. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</a> is also making 'steady progress' in full production, and it is now heading towards 'key objectives' that were agreed upon with publisher and IP owner Rockstar Games.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Remedy is apparently also working on an unannounced project, as evidenced by the slide posted above. The studio hasn't shared any information yet, though, which suggests that it's at an early stage of development.</p>
