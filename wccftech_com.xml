			<p>The Astronauts, the studio behind early access first-person fantasy shooter Witchfire, have released the latest major update for the game, Webgrave, which adds an entire new region to explore called Velmorne, new weapons and gear for players hunt the Witch with, changes to player onboarding, quality of life improvements, and more. </p>



<p>A new trailer showcasing the update has also been debuted, going through several of the changes included in the update, mainly around how player progression and build crafting work in the update. Which is great for returning players, but for new players, and even some returning ones, the arrival of a new in-depth tutorial set on a new map before you're dropped into Hermitory is perhaps the biggest highlight of the update. </p>



<p>What's definitely a welcome feature for returning players is the introduction of a new difficulty level, Gnosis VI, to raise the stakes even higher if you've already found yourself running through Witchfire's challenges without issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Witchfire was first launched into early access on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/">Epic Games Store in 2023</a>, and then on Steam in <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/">September 2024</a>. The studio has continually updated and tweaked the game in response to feedback from players, and in a press release for today's update, The Astronauts co-founder and creative director, Adrian Chmielarz, thanked players for taking that journey with the studio.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to our early adopters! To all of you who have participated in our Early Access so far: Thank you very much for your help in getting us to this point</em>,<em>" </em>Chmielarz said. "<em>Your feedback in our official Discord and beyond has been vital!"</em></p>



<p>Witchfire will have been in early access for two years this coming September. Now that the game is getting a proper tutorial as part of this expansion, and an overhaul to its weapons and ability systems, it'll be interesting to see if we finally get word of a 1.0 release coming sometime next year.</p>

			<p>Glen Schofield is a name that horror video game fans have known since the arrival of the first Dead Space game in 2008. He's credited as the creator of the series, and even though he spent some time away from horror during his Call of Duty days in the 2010s, it's clear he was always pulled to the genre since he tried to return to it with The Callisto Protocol in 2022. He's worked in the video game industry for over two decades, with most of that time spent in AAA games. Now, he thinks it might all be coming to an end. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), Schofield ponders on the fact that he might have directed his last game when The Callisto Protocol released nearly three years ago now. He talks about what he's been doing for the last eight months, and how he has tried, and been unsuccessful, in finding appropriate financial backing for a project he's been developing with his daughter, who is also a game developer and has worked as an artist in games for the last eight years.</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past eight months, I've been quietly working with my daughter, Nicole, on a new game idea. She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more</em>," Schofield writes. </p>



<p>"<em>We pulled the budget down to $17 million, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of 2nd and 3rd meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10M.' Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5M.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap...I've worked on games of every size. From 2 of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So I'm back to my art. I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so thank you for playing my games</em>."</p>



<p>Schofield also added that the members of the team he and his daughter were working with to develop this early concept horror project are all looking for work, and that his daughter was also one of the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">caught up in the layoffs</a> suffered by Striking Distance Studios, the company that Schofield and others founded back in 2020. SDS also seems to have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">cancelled a project it was working on</a>.</p>



<p>The video game industry is in a tough place at the moment, no doubt about that. Schofield has been around the AAA block more than a few times now, and if this is his sign to hang it up and take early retirement, then it'll have been unfortunate for him to hang up the gloves on a final game like Callisto Protocol.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-%E2%80%9Chave-confidence-in-trusted-age-rating-systems%E2%80%9D-in-response-to-adult-games-removed-from-steam-and-itch-io.1255098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>UKIE, the United Kingdom video game industry trade body, has put out a statement in response to adult games being removed on Steam and Itch.io. </p>



<p>Payment processing partners have been pressuring Itch.io and Valve regarding the adult content available on both platforms. Itch.io "<em><a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">deindexed</a></em>" all adult and NSFW content on its platform last week in response to pressure from payment processing partners and Collective Shout. Valve also <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1945409792207421900">pulled several adult games</a> from its platform earlier this month and<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/"> changed its publishing guidelines</a> to accommodate new policies from processors.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ukie-responds-to-adult-games-being-pulled-from-steam-and-itchio-after-pressure-from-payment-providers">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, UKIE is telling PayPal and other payment processing partners that it should place its confidence in age rating systems like PEGI, rather than ask for the all-out removal of adult and mature content. </p>



<p>"<em>The UK games industry champions creative freedom while taking its responsibilities to players seriously. Clear and consistent age ratings are crucial part of helping people make informed choices about the content they engage with. That's why UKIE strongly supports the use of robust classification systems like PEGI across all platforms, including those hosting adult or experimental content. This ensures that content is labelled appropriately, that younger audiences are protected, and that creators can publish with transparency. We believe payment providers and platforms alike should have confidence in trusted age rating systems and the enforcement mechanisms behind them</em>."</p>



<p>If you don't have your Steam settings tuned to not show you adult content, then you're aware of how much space they take up in the store and in its list of trending games. It's unclear how far the pressure from payment processors will go, and if we'll see all adult content entirely removed from Steam and Itch.io in the coming months. </p>



<p>One thing the internet is not lacking in, however, is adult content. Players looking for those kinds of games will undoubtedly find them elsewhere if Steam and Itch.io stop becoming options for them. The people who will be impacted the most by this are the people creating these games, who already found audiences on Steam and Itch.io, and who will have to start from scratch in one form or another to build those audiences elsewhere.</p>
