			<p>Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, following the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly successful finale of Fortnite Chapter Six: Zero Hour</a>, where 10.5 million players joined the event in the game and over three million were watching through various livestreams.</p>



<p>As fitting for the Golden Coast island, players will 'Storm Surf' their way to it instead of dropping from the Battle Bus as usual. Once there, they'll find a brand new sun-soaked map that can be explored on foot, with vehicles, and even with the new hot air balloons. The developers outlined the following key locations: </p>



<p>● Battlewood Boulevard<br>● Sandy Strip<br>● Wonkeeland<br>● Humble Hills<br>● Bumpy Bay<br>● Classified Canyon</p>



<p>As you can see in the image gallery below, Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break features a fair amount of variety in locales.</p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break introduces a few juicy gameplay additions, such as drivable reboot vans and a self-revive device that can be used when the player is in the DBNO (down but not out) state. DBNO is also further enhanced with the ability to roll and tumble away from enemy fire, a sprinting ability which uses Energy, the ability to use ziplines, ascenders, and even get into cars as a passenger, or crawling or being thrown into the back of the aforementioned reboot van.</p>



<p>Defeating bosses like Human Bill, Hush, or Beach Brutus will let you claim their powers as well as their loot, giving your character full health and shield, a bonus maximum health and shield, infinite energy, and a powerful ability. On the flip side, your position will be visible to nearby opponents at all times.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, during each phase of the storm, Rift anomalies may summon loot and grant powerful effects to everyone in the match. More anomalies will be added throughout the course of the season.</p>



<p>Furthermore, to ensure fairness at the start of a match, gold bars will no longer carry over from one match to another. As such, players should spend them before the current match ends to reboot their teammates, hire characters, or grab powerful gear from vending machines with a new item stock. Epic is also now letting players drop bars to share resources with teammates.</p>



<p>Additional improvements include redesigned hit markers and improved visibility, ammo status indicators for weapons in the inventory, the ability to aim down sight while jumping, a spectator mode that now automatically tunes into the nearest teammate, and an overhauled emote wheel.</p>

<p>The new season adds several new weapons that Epic says are more responsive, offering layered recoil and smoother ADS (aiming down sight) transitions. Reload progress is now saved when your magazine is empty, which is certainly going to be useful. Here's the list of new weapons in Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break:</p>



<p>● Iron Pump Shotgun: A new heavy-hitting Pump Shotgun.<br>● Twin Hammer Shotguns: Dual-wielded Pump Shotguns.<br>● Deadeye Assault Rifle: Scoped, automatic, and built for those who hit headshots at middle-to-long ranges.<br>● Holo Rush SMG: Scoped, fast, and dangerous in tight quarters.<br>● Vengeful Sniper Rifle: Reaps opponents with bolt-action precision.<br>● Arc-Lightning Gun: Zap players, vehicles, and builds with electricity.<br>● Forsaken Vow Blade: Dash in and out faster than with the Kinetic Blade, unleashing a flurry of lightning-fast strikes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-wingsuit.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The wingsuit is a featured item for this season, allowing players to glide through the Golden Coast island. Moreover, the following items are returning from the Vault:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart (alongside the usual sports cars and SUVs)</li>



<li>Enforcer AR, Tactical Pistol and Dual Micro SMG</li>



<li>Shockwave and Clinger grenades</li>



<li>Chug Jugs</li>



<li>Shield Kegs</li>



<li>Med Kits</li>



<li>Bandages</li>



<li>Shield Potions</li>



<li>Mini Shield Potions</li>



<li>Zero Build only: Shield Bubble Jrs and Port-a-Bunkers</li>
</ul>



<p>The Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break Battle Pass lets you seek revenge as The Bride, represent the future as Marty McFly and unlock Fortnite originals such as Miles Cross and Cat Holloway, plus a new version of Dark Voyager. It also features special styles for three outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). These additional Styles can only be unlocked by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload and Battle Royale, respectively.</p>
