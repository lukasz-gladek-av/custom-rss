			<p>The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims?utm_source=govdelivery">announced today</a> that it will send refunds to players who made unwanted purchases in Fortnite, with the refunds totaling over $126 million. The agency will also reopen the process for players and their parents or guardians to make claims for further compensation from now until <strong>July 9, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This latest batch of refunds is a follow-up from the 629,344 refunds issued in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-users-refunds-are-being-issued-by-the-ftc-following-settlement-of-fortnite-case/">December 2024</a> over what the FTC described as "<em>deceptive</em>" practices from Epic that led to players making unwanted purchases in the first place.</p>
<p>While the agency disclosed the average refund amount in December to be $114 per person, it does not disclose what the average refund will be this time around, perhaps due to the fact that there's still time for people to submit claims. Beginning today, however, either through PayPal or a check, the FTC will begin delivering <strong>969,173</strong> refunds.</p>
<p>If you selected to receive a check on your claim form, the FTC recommends you cash it within 90 days. PayPal recipients should redeem their refund within 30 days.</p>
<p>Including today's batch of refunds, the FTC has now provided players with more than <strong>$200 million</strong> as part of the FTC's punitive action against Epic Games.</p>
<p>This claims process began in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-announces-claims-process-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items">September 2023</a> and is part of the $245 million Epic was fined for its practices regarding microtransactions in Fortnite. The first claims process lasted from September 2023 to January 2024, though if you missed that window, you now have an extra two weeks to get your cut of the refunds from Epic Games.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, has surpassed 3 million unique players and 1 million copies sold, the studio has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">announced</a>.</p>
<p>It's a big milestone for the studio and a strong follow-up from its previous martial arts hit, Sifu, and seemingly a clear sign that being available on Xbox Game Pass at launch was a major boon for the multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Rematch officially launched for everyone on June 19, and just in its first 24 hours, was able to hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">1 million unique players</a> jumping onto the pitch, whether they bought the game or played it through Game Pass.</p>
<p>Now, less than a week from its official launch, and a week from its early access release for those who paid for the deluxe edition, it's tripled that number of players and still managed to hit a strong sales milestone.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/app.bsky.feed.post/3lseohvckdc2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidvoyjxlkjdfbfv5exlp4pcg27aif6ns45mek4bz3f73gamodfqpu">
<p>Rematch has officially reached 3M unique players!For those keeping score, that's- 11.8M matches played- 55.6M goals scored- 33.5M assists- 69.1M savesThis is just the beginning.Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!#rematch</p>
<p>â€” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe?ref_src=embed">Rematch (@playrematch.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/post/3lseohvckdc2a?ref_src=embed">2025-06-24T18:00:48.389Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, and was happy to be able to report that none of the issues I have with the game come from the core gameplay. It's a very tightly-made game, which makes it all the more unfortunate that there are so many issues around the core gameplay in how it's all structured that bring the experience down. Issues like poor menu design, slow-progression, and the misclassification of actions while in games, like how a goalie punching the ball away from a shot on net instead of catching it is counted as an interception, instead of a save.</p>
<p>Still, none of these issues are worth stopping you checking it out, as many of them can thankfully be patched out, along with all the bugs that myself and 3 million other players have had to endure. And, not to beat a dead horse with regarding the launch discourse around the game, but if you're playing Rematch, for the love of all that is good in football, please learn to pass.</p>
