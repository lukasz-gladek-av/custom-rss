			<p>Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on March 25, 2025, but the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">delayed</a> with no new release date announced weeks before that initial date. On Friday, Tripwire Interactive finally announced the new release date for <strong>July 24, 2025,</strong> making it a four-month delay.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the new date, Tripwire Interactive's creative director, Bryan Wynia, marked the "<em>incredible</em>" support the studio has seen from fans of the Killing Floor series, since Tripwire delayed Killing Floor 3 specifically to respond to feedback from the series' community.</p>
<p>It was after a closed beta for Killing Floor 3 that didn't go as well as Tripwire would have wanted, which largely influenced the decision to delay the game another four months. Tripwire noted in its March statement confirming the delay that the feedback from that closed beta made the team realize it had "<em>missed the mark</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared</em> <em>vision,</em>" Wynia said in today's press release.</p>
<p>"<em>The support from fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.</em>"</p>
<p>Part of Tripwire's method of responding to community feedback during the delay period has been consistently updating fans on the progress the team made through the game's <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?forums/kf-3-news-announcements.2333661/">official forums</a>. Updates and changes to the UI, design, and artwork have been posted nearly every few days since the delay was announced on March 7, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake may not be in development, but Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, one of the main scenario writers and designers of the classic role-playing game, is "contemplating" developing one.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameReactor</a>, the beloved developer mentioned that it has been a long time since the original was released and that he definitely wants to do something with it. As he has received a lot of requests from fans for a Chrono Trigger remake, he is starting to contemplate it, suggesting that it would be an HD-2D remake and not a full-blown 3D remake in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy.</p>
<p>Besides talking about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger remake, the Dragon Quest series creator also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yuji-horiis-best-tribute-to-the-late-akira-toriyama-we-can-make-a-next-title-using-what-he-had-left-1540733/">future of the series</a> in relation to Akira Toriyama's unfortunate passing. After remarking on how he was shocked at learning that Toriyama-san had passed away, Horii-san revealed that he had left many things before he passed, and he believes that another entry in the series can use what he left to ensure some continuity with the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p data-start="142" data-end="587"><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">Last week</a>, it truly seemed like a Chrono Trigger remake was in development, as Yuji Horii reportedly confirmed it during this year's Napoli COMICON. However, expectations were quickly dashed when it was clarified that the statement was a misunderstanding caused by an interpreter error. Still, given recent statements, there's reason to remain hopeful, even if it may be some time before we can embark once again on one of the most epic journeys through time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-strategy-publishers-baffled-no-xbox-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The current Xbox multiplatform strategy is leaving certain publishers and developers baffled, so much so that they no longer see the need to develop Xbox versions of their games, considering the consolidated PlayStation dominance on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgCII8nnKHg&amp;t=1150s"> recent podcast</a>, The Game Business's co-founder Christopher Dring commented on the current situation of the console market, highlighting how, with Xbox's multiplatform strategy, PlayStation is the dominant player more than ever before in the console space. Almost every Xbox game launching this year is also coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, like DOOM: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>. Only Avowed and South of Midnight did not launch on PlayStation 5 this year, but they could be the final Xbox console exclusives for the time being.</p>
<p>While the Xbox multiplatform strategy could be paying off in some way, as Microsoft's published games on PlayStation 5 are doing quite well, certain publishers and developers are reportedly baffled. From their point of view, they want the competition in the console space, and if Microsoft is releasing their games at launch on other systems, seemingly leaving their hardware behind, they don't see the need to create Xbox versions of games. As such, Christopher Dring highlighted, Microsoft will have to strike a balance in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Has Xbox’s Call of Duty Game Pass gamble paid off?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgCII8nnKHg?start=1150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the current multiplatform strategy seems to suggest otherwise, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles won't be the last gaming systems by Microsoft. The company is hard at work on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include an Xbox-branded handheld in development together with ASUS, of which we saw the first images <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/">earlier this week,</a> a full-fledged handheld system and a proper home console that will be the successor to the Xbox Series X and that will deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical&nbsp;leap to date</a>. With the current market conditions being so challenging, however, plans could definitely change, and it will be very interesting to see how the big console manufacturers will manage to overcome all these hurdles that are making gaming a very expensive hobby.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some Steam Deck and PC-specific fixes alongside other improvements and balance changes.</p>
<p>The 1.2.3 patch introduces a minor Steam Deck improvement, fixing backgrounds of various menus not displaying correctly on the system, as well as various ultrawide resolutions fixes, including gameplay no longer becoming zoomed after a cutscene, combat UI not properly adapting to ultrawide resolutions, cutscenes no longer getting letterboxed in 32:9 ratio, and more. Mouse and Keyboard controls also received some improvements, such as UI button prompts in the Expedition Menu now being fully visible and triggered with Keyboard, mouse button remaining responsive after first use, and more.</p>
<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also packs some fixes for areas where characters would get stuck on the world map, situations where Esquie would get stuck, and some balance changes. The skill that saw the most significant change is Maelle's Stendhal, which was extremely powerful in the previous version of the game, and could be easily used to one-shot even the most powerful bosses with the proper setup. You can learn more about every change the patch brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499446847117461384?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-1-will-continue-to-be-supported-with-new-games-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the imminent launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Japanese company will continue to support the older console with new games. The confirmation arrived with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's latest quarterly financial report</a>, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>These are first-party titles for Nintendo Switch that have already been announced: Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025), Pokémon Champions (TBD). In the Nintendo Direct held this March, we announced plans to release the titles Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream in 2026.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, we will continue to bring out new titles for the over 100 million people worldwide who are playing Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>The console's hardware sales have unsurprisingly declined year-over-year. Whereas in fiscal year 2024 Nintendo sold in (to retailers) 15.70 million units, fiscal year 2025 hardware sales stopped at 10.80 million units, a 31.2% drop. Cumulative sell-through (to consumers) lifetime sales are approaching 150 million units.</p>
<p>With such a huge install base, second only in the all-time console hardware charts to Sony's PlayStation 2 (the best-selling console of all time with over 160 million units sold), it's no wonder that Nintendo wants to keep making games for the Switch. At the same time, Nintendo also understands the importance of making exclusive titles to push consumers to buy the new Switch 2 when it lands on June 5. For instance, Mario Kart World <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will only be available on the new console</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be making the switch (pun entirely intended) right away, or will you keep playing with the previous console for some time? Let us know in the comments!</p>
