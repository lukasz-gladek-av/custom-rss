			<p>It might be difficult to imagine that increased sales of <strong>Nintendo's</strong> latest hybrid console, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, in any region, let alone its home base of Japan, would actually hurt the console's profitability. But that's exactly what's happening, according to Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>. In the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">official translation of its Q&amp;A section</a> from its third-quarter financial report, Furukawa confirmed that the "<em>better-than-projected</em>" sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 in Japan<strong> will negatively impact the Switch 2's operating and gross profit</strong>.</p>



<p>How is that the case? Because the parts Nintendo uses to manufacture the Nintendo Switch 2 are purchased in U.S. dollars. So when players in Japan purchase a Switch 2 with Japanese Yen, a currency that is currently in a downward trend, Nintendo still ends up losing money.</p>



<p>During the Q&amp;A section, an investor asked Furukawa, "<em>Considering that most procurement costs are in U.S. dollars, do I understand correctly that profitability is declining due to the continuing depreciation of the Yen?</em>" They also asked if Furukawa could explain why Switch 2 sales in Japan are doing as well as they are, and the answer, according to Furukawa, lies with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hardware-related procurement purchases are primarily made in U.S. dollars, so given the current exchange rate environment, the better-than-projected hardware sales in Japan will have a <strong>downward effect on gross profit and operating profit</strong></em>," Furukawa responded. </p>



<p>"<em>The backdrop of hardware sales in Japan trending better than our expectations was the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders during the holiday season, building on the initial momentum of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware</em>. <em>We believe that users in Japan <strong>saw these titles as an opportunity to transition to Nintendo Switch 2</strong> at a relatively higher rate compared to Nintendo Switch owners outside of Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>This interesting tidbit appeared amidst Furukawa having to answer a flurry of questions about the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage</a></strong> that is currently impacting the entire tech industry, and how Nintendo is planning to accommodate it. It's no surprise that investors only really wanted to talk about the memory shortage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/">especially after <strong>Nintendo lost $14 billion</strong> in share value towards the end of last year</a>, directly due to memory shortage fears. </p>



<p>For now, Furukawa doesn't want to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-doesnt-want-to-be-overly-influenced-by-rising-ram-costs-nintendo-switch-2-price-to-remain-stable-for-now/">"<em><strong>overly influenced</strong>" </em></a>by something that could turn out to be a short-term trend, though with recent reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-suppliers-are-taking-zero-chances-on-losing-in-a-dram-contract/">memory suppliers are taking "<em><strong>zero</strong>" </em>chances of being shortchanged</a>, Furukawa and Nintendo may end up having to increase the price of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, that's only one possible outcome, not an inevitability. In the meantime, the Switch 2 is still selling like gangbusters outside of Japan as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-17-million-first-switch-best-selling-console/">as the console sold <strong>17.37 million units</strong> in 2025</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Dying Light 2 Didn’t Feature Any of My Designs; I Wouldn’t Work with Techland Again” Says Chris Avellone]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when renowned game writer and designer <strong>Chris Avellone</strong> stood on the stage of <strong>Xbox's E3 2018 showcase</strong> to unveil <strong>Dying Light 2</strong> and its choice and consequence system?</p>



<p>That was the main way developer <strong>Techland</strong> signaled <strong>the shift from the first game's action-adventure genre to an action RPG</strong>. Avellone is famous for having written and/or designed <strong>some of the best Western RPGs</strong>, including Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout: New Vegas, <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a>, and <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/torment-tides-numenera-review-tides-shifted-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>.</p>



<p>The goal was to create a narrative sandbox that would respond to the player's choices in meaningful ways. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end result wasn't that great in this regard</a>, and Techland returned to a linear, non-RPG structure with its more recent game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://80.lv/articles/chris-avellone-on-writing-making-game-stories-engaging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published today on the website 80 Level</a>, Avellone says <strong>none of his designs made it into the final version of Dying Light 2</strong>. After criticizing the continuous shifting lore at the base of the game and the fact that ideas were only accepted if they came from certain leads, he added that <strong>he wouldn't work with Techland again</strong>.</p>



<p><em>I love designing reactivity in characters, factions, companions, locations, and anything that allows the player to make a mark on the world. So the design of the lore was to create factions that could change over time, had different agendas, had different approaches to the "survival" theme, and the setting was designed to allow for the introduction of new factions and enemies at points in the game based on clear, player-inspired actions.</em></p>



<p><em>That said, none of these designs made it into the game. I recall doing several treatments for a branching, reactive story, but none of them seemed to land, and it became apparent that unless the idea came from particular leads, it wasn't going to gain any traction. Ironically, some of those same leads expressed similar frustrations with trying to build lore and the story, to the point that at least one of them quit the lead role in the later stages (this was after I left). The lore process was also compounded by the fact that there was a rotating queue of writers that seemed to come onto the project and vanish. While I lasted the longest, it made keeping a consistent lore and tone approach difficult.</em></p>



<p><em>Techland and the Dying Light 2 team had great developers in the trenches, some of whom I've worked with on later projects and others who are friends to this day. That said, due to the other difficulties mentioned, I wouldn't work with Techland again.</em></p>



<p>Perhaps the fact that Techland was among the studios that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-accused-of-sexual-harassment-misconduct-several-studios-cut-ties-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly cut their ties to Avellone when he was accused of misconduct and sexual harassment</a></strong> is still not insignificant in his viewpoint. Around three years later, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-case-has-been-resolved-sexual-allegation-claims-have-been-retracted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sexual allegation claims made against Avellone were retracted</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, the game writer and designer is keeping very busy with four different projects, although the main one is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-joins-republic-games-to-work-on-dark-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the dark fantasy RPG in development at Republic Games</a></strong>. Avellone adds that it's perhaps the project he's enjoyed working on the most so far, and that's saying something given his track record.</p>

			<p><strong>Ori </strong>developer <strong>Moon Studios</strong> took a big swing with <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>, choosing to make something outside of its 2D platforming comfort zone and instead direct its talents into making an action RPG. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">initial early access launch in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, it was clear that the game had a lot of unrealized potential, and the time to realize that potential as an early access game. </p>



<p>Now, over a year and a half later, during which the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-patch/">has seen more than</a> a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-breach-update-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-lots-of-content/">few significant updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/">being <strong>a co-op update</strong> that went live last month</a>, it's starting to realize that potential. A little more than <strong>two weeks</strong> after Moon Studios confirmed that the game had sold over <strong>1 million copies</strong>, the developer gave players another sales milestone update: No Rest for the Wicked has officially sold over <strong>1.5 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Wicked fans, it's been only <strong>15 days </strong>since our previous 1 million announcement, and already we're happy to make a small correction," </em>the team wrote on the game's Steam page.<em> "Now it's <strong>1.5 million copies sold so far</strong>. We're honestly so happy to see this as a small dev studio doing internal publishing. We want to thank you, our players, for being here with us, whether it's through your amazing support, sharing</em> <em>your love for the game, giving us constructive feedback, patiently waiting for consoles, or cheering us on from the sidelines.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been only 15 days since our 1 million announcement, and we’re incredibly happy to share a small correction:</p><p>We’ve now reached 1.5 MILLION copies sold!</p><p>Thank you all, you’ve been a huge part of this ❤️</p><p>Last day to get 40% off on Steam: <a href="https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j">https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j</a> <a href="https://t.co/kc51LM4JRi">pic.twitter.com/kc51LM4JRi</a></p></div>— No Rest for the Wicked (@wickedgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame/status/2019078495964459314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This milestone came just as No Rest for the Wicked closed off a sale where the game was discounted by 40%, and also serves as a means of putting down any fears or concerns<a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/"> that the studio is in any kind of trouble</a>.</p>



<p>Two short years ago, months before Moon Studios would release No Rest for the Wicked, analysts were <a href="https://wccftech.com/games-industry-to-become-even-more-concentrated-pure-play-companies-will-be-challenged-but-hits-like-palworld-will-still-occur/">sharing concerns over how concentrated the industry was becoming</a>, and how it would only become more challenging for smaller studios to make an impact. To see an <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/">independent studio that's also publishing its own game</a> find success is a positive sign, one that we'll hopefully see repeated with other developers throughout 2026. </p>
