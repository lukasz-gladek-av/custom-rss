			<p>It seems like <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong> is finally happening. It's been over eight years since the release of <strong>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</strong>, and fans were almost losing hope that the third chapter of <strong>William "B.J." Blazkowicz</strong>'s story would actually happen.</p>



<p>Developer MachineGames <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-iii-hint-play-with-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had started teasing it very early</a>, just <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few months after the launch of the second entry</a>, but then they went quiet about it for a long time. With <strong>Arkane Lyon</strong>'s help, the Swedish studio would instead release two spin-offs, <strong>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</strong> and the VR-only <strong>Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</strong>, in 2019. Both of them failed critically and commercially, though, and MachineGames turned to  <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong>, based on a pitch by Bethesda's <strong>Todd Howard</strong>. I'm glad they did; <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was an amazing game</a></strong>, and it was rightfully recognized as such. That said, <strong>it's high time to finish Blazkowicz's journey</strong>. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Wolfenstein 3 being in development were reignited</a></strong> thanks to reports from Kotaku and Windows Central. MachineGames studio director <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> also chimed in a few weeks ago and, while remaining vague about the development timeline, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-can-be-now-it-can-be-later-but-were-not-done-with-it-machinegames-will-make-wolfenstein-3-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that the developer wasn't done with the series</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st is reporting</a> that a casting call is already out, with Performance Director <strong>Tom Keegan</strong> and Casting Director <strong>Emily Schweber</strong> attached to the process. The game's codename is apparently '<strong>Valkyrie</strong>', and the casting call is for the role of <strong>Sofiya</strong>, a Ukrainian orphan aged between 8 and 11. Sofiya is said to form a bond with the main character throughout the game and accompany him on his travels alongside her adopted dog, Ralph.</p>



<p>MP1st also adds a brief overview of the character from the casting call:</p>



<p><em>While initially suspicious and traumatized by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor.<br></em><br>Performance capture reportedly begins in April, and additional shooting dates are planned throughout 2026 and into 2027.</p>



<p>Still, <strong>it will likely take some time before MachineGames can show us anything of Wolfenstein 3</strong>. They were, after all, busy with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle until recently with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Order of Giants DLC</a>. Perhaps 2028-2029 could be a realistic release window. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is also working with Amazon MGM Studios on a TV adaptation</a></strong> that will air on Prime Video.</p>
