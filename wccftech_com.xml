			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera, a new sci-fi first-person shooter in development at Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine), 4A Games (the Malta office) decided to <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> a brief explanation to those in the community who might still be confused.</p>
<p>As we explained in last week's news, the two studios are entirely separate now, and the Maltan developer, who is now the only one to carry the revered name, has confirmed to be working on the next Metro installment with franchise creator Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>
<p><em>We are the team that created and built the Metro games you know and love. We’re still making the next Metro with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the same core founders, leadership, developers, and nearly 20 years experience on the series. We also have our other new IP project in the works. We’ll reveal more about both when we’re ready.</em></p>
<p><em>We are proudly Ukrainian in our roots, and in the majority of our diverse team. We make games from our offices in Kyiv and Sliema, as well as remotely, and even sometimes from the front line in Ukraine. We now have studios in two countries, but the majority of our team remain in Ukraine - roughly 150 out of about 200+. The rest work in Malta, or remotely.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2014, we, led by the original "four A's" - the founders of 4A Games - formed “4A Games Limited” and created a new HQ in Malta with roughly 50 of our fellow team members. We have since grown and work to this day on Metro under contract with Deep Silver and Plaion.</em></p>
<p><em>We continued to work closely with our remaining Ukrainian colleagues at “4A Games Ukraine” on Metro Exodus through an outsource relationship led by us. Once Metro Exodus and its DLC was released, we created another Kyiv studio under 4A Games Limited and welcomed roughly 50 more of our colleagues to continue on with us, while 4A Games Ukraine continued to pursue their own project La Quimera, as a completely separate entity and recently renamed themselves Reburn. We wish them every success.</em></p>
<p><em>The 4A Games you know and love have not changed, and we are not rebranding. We are the same developers of Metro that brought you Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux, and Metro Exodus.</em></p>
<p>It's been a long time since the last mainline entry in the post-apocalyptic franchise. Exodus <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched over six years ago</a>, after all. Sure, there have been the DLCs and other post-launch drops, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-enhanced-edition-impressions-4a-games-delivers-the-most-advanced-lighting-yet-without-sacrificing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhanced Edition</a> and the mod tools, but the fans are eager to get back into the world envisioned by Dmitry Glukhovsky - and the recently released VR-only game <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Awakening</a> (developed by Vertigo Games) certainly didn't sate them.</p>
<p>4A Games owner THQ Nordic (now Embracer Group) first <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Metro game in August 2019. Since then, the studio has been awfully quiet, although they did <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> about a year ago that the next game is coming in '202X'. Industry rumors have previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sequel-reportedly-fully-playable-could-be-revealed-later-this-year-for-2024-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> the game to have been fully playable as early as February 2023, so perhaps they'll surprise with a launch in late 2025 or early 2026.</p>
