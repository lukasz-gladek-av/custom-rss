			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> that the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> will feature three games: <strong>Playground</strong>'s <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, and <strong>Game Freak</strong>'s new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong> intellectual property.</p>



<p>However, out of three Xbox Developer Direct presentations, on two occasions there were also secret announcements that Microsoft held off until the actual show. The very first time, in 2023, there was the reveal and shadow drop of <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>' <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was critically acclaimed</a> but still proved insufficient to prevent Microsoft from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>shutting down the studio</strong> just over a year later</a>. Thankfully, the Japanese developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was later resurrected by KRAFTON</a></strong>, which also acquired the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>



<p>Last year, the surprise came once again from Japan as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">shadowdropped</a> <strong>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</strong>, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the acclaimed action game, and also announced <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to a great reception</a> in late 2025.</p>



<p>Well, according to the trustworthy insider <strong>shinobi602</strong>, there's going to be another surprise in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. In a post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ResetEra board</a>, he wrote:</p>



<p><em>There's a 'secret' fourth game.</em></p>



<p>When asked by a fellow user if he was excited about it, he replied that he actually wasn't very excited about this game, but that was only due to his personal taste. At this point, it is really anyone's guess what it could be, so all bets are off.</p>



<p>Still, the three confirmed games should be enough to carry the show on their own. Forza Horizon 6 is the sure bet: if Playground keeps the upward trajectory of the previous few games, we're in for a treat, and the studio's claim that its open world rendition of Japan <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will 'blow fans' away</a></strong> definitely raised the excitement.</p>



<p>Fable is a bit more of a wild card. Playground has worked on this project for eight years, and we still know very little about it (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have hyped the game</a> as being reminiscent of The Witcher 3 in some ways). However, the show announcement blog mentioned we'd get the first in-depth look at new 'stunning' gameplay, reportedly portraying all of the franchise's tenets: British humour, choices and consequences, drama, and chickens.</p>



<p>Then there's the third-party game, Beast of Reincarnation. It's the first non-Pokémon project of Game Freak, and thus there's a lot of hype for it, although we don't really know much except that it chronicles the journey of one man and their dog in post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, just like the other two, is due to launch this year on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 airs on<strong> January 22</strong> at <strong>10 AM Pacific / 1 PM Eastern / 6 PM UK</strong> on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.</p>

			<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII</em></strong> often dominates the spotlight, its 1994 predecessor, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, remains the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">holy grail</strong>" for many long-term series fans. It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Creative Vision Behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth | Naoki Hamaguchi Exclusive Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbrBjFZabUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>

			<p>James Cameron's big blue aliens are back in theatres in Avatar: Fire and Ash and Ubisoft is piggybacking on the film with some new Avatar content of their own. Not a full new game this time around, but rather a major expansion, <a href="avatar:%20Frontiers%20of%20Pandora%20-%20From%20the%20Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes</a>. This DLC offers a new campaign that introduces the violent Mangkwan tribe from Cameron's latest movie, although it isn't entirely standalone, as you still need to own the base Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game to play it. The expansion arrived shortly after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-2-update-adds-third-person-ng-dlss-4-mfg-rr-fsr4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Frontiers of Pandora update</a>, which added a number of much-requested features, including a third-person mode.</p>



<p>Has Ubisoft delivered an enticing new reason to open up this Pandora's Box again? Or is this DLC not worth getting fired up about? Scroll on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora47.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was quite a remarkable game in a lot of ways (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read my full review here</a>) offering eye-popping visuals and an impressively huge and varied world, but its combat was its unfortunate Achilles’ heel. Your Na'vi character was a frustratingly flimsy 9-foot-tall glass cannon, particularly early on in the game, and being sneaky wasn't really an alternative either as the game didn't offer the player much of a stealth tool kit and punished you severely for any minor screwup. I still enjoyed the game overall at launch, but there was no denying it had some big glowing red (or, uh, blue) weak spots.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora48.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, a hearty kudos to Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment, as they’ve done quite a good job of identifying and fixing a lot of the issues Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched with. Some of these fixes, including toning down enemy AI and adding the third-person mode, have been incorporated into Frontiers of Pandora as a whole through patches, while others, including an array of combat upgrades, are exclusive to the From the Ashes expansion.</p>



<p>From the Ashes casts players as the "Dog Tag Warrior" So'lek, the badass Na'vi who rescues your character at the beginning of Frontiers of Pandora's campaign. The narrative of From the Ashes jumps forward in time a bit, with the RDA and Mangkwan teaming to torch large portions of the Kinglor Forest. Of course, it’s up to So'lek to bring them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora52-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While From the Ashes’ plot is relatively straightforward, So'lek is definitely a more compelling and proactive hero than what we got in the core game and the Mangkwan make for memorable villains. In a fun twist, you also get to team up with your protagonist from the first game, Tamtey (aka "The Sarentu"), who shows more personality here than in their own campaign. From the Ashes delivers a good handful of memorable moments without all the padding (the confusing and laborious character progression of the core game has been significantly streamlined).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora50.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes was specifically designed to be played in third-person, and for the most part, the change of viewpoint works out well. Surprisingly, one aspect you'd <em>think</em> would greatly benefit from a third-person mode, platforming, hasn’t improved all that much. Jumping is still rather unresponsive and imprecise. That said, third-person mode makes it a lot easier and more intuitive to assess your surroundings, making it the clear choice for combat and stealth scenarios.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Sneaking up on baddies is a lot less maddening now, due to the new perspective, improved enemy marking, and added instant stealth finishers. But if you want to mix it up with the RDA head on, that's now also a viable strategy, as So'lek eats RDA troops for breakfast. You're not nearly as frail as in the base game, new slow-motion aiming lets you make killer shots in a pinch, and Warrior Senses, a super mode you can activate once you fill a meter by dealing or taking enough damage, lets you go ham on entire waves of enemies. Ah, but the RDA have new tricks too. Upgraded armored enemy types and pesky robot dogs will require you to make smart use of So'lek's powerful abilities. New boss fights, including showdowns with rival Mangkwan, offer fresh challenges that stand apart from the usual RDA troops in exo suits schtick.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora51.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>From the Ashes doesn't offer much in the way of entirely new locales, instead opting to reshape the Kinglor Forest map from the core game, adding plenty of fire and ash to previously lush locales. A lot of From the Ashes' main missions revolve around reimaging key landmarks from the core game in fun and interesting ways, with, for instance, the once-safe Hometree being taken over by a large RDA base and the serene Rookery becoming a fiery gauntlet of challenging platforming and pitched combat.</p>



<p>While a lot has been improved, I don’t want to go overboard with the praise, as this still isn’t a perfect game. As mentioned, platforming remains stiff, and I wouldn't consider From the Ashes a truly top-tier shooter or stealth experience. But make no mistake, it <em>is</em> better than it was, and Massive have done an admirable job of refreshing their world and justifying this expansion’s $25 price tag – the core campaign is a solid 10 hours long, and those looking for 100 percent completion could spend twice that long.</p>

<p>While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes is still a bit rough around the edges in some respects, you have to give developer Massive Entertainment credit for at least trying to fix almost every complaint fans had about the original game, sometimes quite successfully. Combat in particular is much improved, making embodying a 9-foot-tall alien warrior into the empowering experience it always should have been. If you enjoyed the original Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, you'll probably love From the Ashes, but even those left cold by the core game may find this DLC sparks something in them.</p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. If you already own the core game, you can pick up the expansion for $25, while those just coming on board now can get the original game and DLC packaged together for only $40.</p>
