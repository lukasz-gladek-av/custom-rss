			<p>Where Winds Meet is the hottest new free-to-play game on the market as 2025 winds down, and developer Everstone Studio and publisher NetEase are ready for its popularity with a jam-packed month of updates for the game's December 2025 roadmap.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">hitting over 9 million players on PC and PS5</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997337719257895205">more than 5 million pre-registrations for the mobile version</a>, which is still to arrive on December 12, 2025, Everstone Studio is already adding huge chunks to the game, the big highlight being the addition of an entire new region for players to explore called Roaring Sands.</p>



<p>There are also new bosses to defeat, including a new campaign boss, and new limited-time activities for players to take advantage of.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Discover the Winds of December:</p><p>🗺️New Region: Roaring Sands<br>🌊New Bosses: River Master and Feng Ruzhi<br>📱Global Mobile Launch: Dec 12 (UTC)<br>🗡️New Hero's Realm, Sword Trial and more! <a href="https://t.co/d12Ra9uXwb">pic.twitter.com/d12Ra9uXwb</a></p></div>— Where Winds Meet (@WhereWindsMeet_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997001761807388991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The first week of additions, which includes the two new Jianghu Legacy quests, is already available at the time of this writing. The second week additions, which include the new River Master campaign boss and the big highlight of the Roaring Sands region, will arrive at the end of this week, alongside the game's launch on iOS and Android mobile devices.</p>



<p>The second new boss fight of the month, Feng Ruzhi, will arrive in the third week, alongside two limited-time activities. The final week offers the Scarlet Shock Sword Trial and Hero's Realm: Blade Dance activity, on top of a festively themed Fireworks Festival.</p>



<p>As post-launch content goes, it's clear that NetEase and Everstone have hit the ground running, ready to build off the momentum of the game's strong launch. If it can keep up its numbers now that millions of players have already stepped into its world, it could be the next Genshin Impact-level multiplayer action RPG.</p>



<p>For more on Where Winds Meet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">check out Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, who gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The development of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 began even before the release of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></a>. Over the past year or so, director Naoki Hamaguchi teased how the experience, likely deeply rooted in the introduction of the Highwind airship, will be different from its predecessors while confirming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/"><strong>development was proceeding smoothly.</strong></a> And finally, we are nearing the point at which more information on the highly anticipated game can be shared, the first reportedly coming before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@julienchieze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Julien Chièze</strong></a>, Hamaguchi-san commented on the current development state of the game, confirming that its experience is almost complete as the development team is focusing on fully fleshing out the experience.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, honestly, I want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but since it's a game, we must properly finish the detailed work, and only then can we deliver it to the users,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said in regards to when Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will launch. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, after properly going through that [fleshing out] phase, we want to deliver it to everyone in a satisfactory form, so if you can just wait a little longer, I believe we will reach the stage where we can deliver various information to everyone,"</em> he added.</p>



<p>Speaking about the game's final name, Hamaguchi-san said that he and Tetsuya Nomura have <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"narrowed down"</em> the options to two, and he expects the final choice to be made before the end of the year.</p>

<p>While it may be too early to see Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 in action, the fact that we are nearing the point when more can be shared about it is definitely exciting. As for when this moment will arrive, it's not easy to say. Though unlikely if the game's name hasn't been finalized yet, if an announcement accompanied by the very first footage is coming before the end of the year, this week's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</strong></a> would be the perfect occasion to begin the marketing cycle for one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the next few years.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't see the light of day anytime soon, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S owners who did not have the chance to play the Remake trilogy yet will finally get their chance next year, starting with Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade, which<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">launches this January on the Nintendo and Microsoft current-generation systems.</strong></a> The other two entries in the trilogy will also launch on both systems in the future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/</link>
            <guid>1376203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> has, as it does each week, the latest <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> for the top-selling games in the EU. This time, the weekly sales are from the week of November 24-30, which includes all of the Black Friday sales numbers, with EA Sports FC 26 winning the day in both sales by revenue and units sold. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to stay ahead of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In fairness, both of fall 2025's popular shooters were in the top five for the week, with Black Ops 7 riding its launch wave and Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-amazon/">getting put on a fairly significant Black Friday sale</a>, though the discount <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-loses-ground-eu-sales-charts-black-friday-sales/">wasn't enough to change the rankings from the week before</a>, with Black Ops 7 still holding fast just above Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was another notable entry in the charts. Even though it came in eighth place on the sales by revenue chart, it shot up all the way to second place in the units sold chart, beating Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 rounded out the top five units sold list, while on the revenue charts, after Battlefield 6 in third, Pokémon Legends Z-A and NBA 2K26 rounded out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>



<p>None of the entries in the revenue chart or units sold chart were brand new releases, with everyone taking advantage of Black Friday sales to pick up older games they had been eyeing. In fact, the most recent release on both charts was technically Black Ops 7, since it's the only game on either top ten list that released in November 2025.</p>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by units sold for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>
</ol>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by revenue for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>

<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</li>
</ol>



<p>Elsewhere in The Game Business' report, on the hardware side of things per NielsenIQ, it was the PlayStation 5, not the Nintendo Switch 2, that was the hottest hardware item of the week. Not that the Switch 2 was a slouch, but significant discounts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-available-at-lowest-price-of-648-99-on-amazon-despite-sale-period-ended/">on the PS5 Pro</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-takes-100-off-ps5-for-black-friday-sales/"> base PS5 models</a> helped push it to be, according to The Game Business, the only console to actually improve on its sales numbers compared to last year.</p>



<p>Overall, not the most surprising Black Friday sales charts. Popular sports games and first-person shooters are at the top of the charts, with the rest of the list filled up by regulars on the charts like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<p>Though you do wonder if Microsoft continues to change how it delivers its games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-xbox-exec-says-microsoft-would-be-delighted-to-avoid-making-hardware-and-delivering-games-netflix-style/">particularly if it goes full-on into the Netflix-style distribution as former executive Peter Moore suggested</a>, will Call of Duty or any other Microsoft-owned game still make these charts, or will the subscription-based focus leave a gap for other games to claim a spot as one of the regularly best-selling games week-to-week?</p>

            <guid>1376146</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima is no stranger to creating unique experiences that challenge established gameplay formulas. With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding series</a></strong>, the legendary creator of the Metal Gear Solid series has created open-world experiences that are markedly different from anything else on the market, transforming a desolate post-apocalyptic world into the perfect setting for players to form meaningful bonds through gameplay. With the horror game OD, however, it sounds like the legendary creator will push video game boundaries even further, as he isn't sure the experience will work out in the end.</p>



<p>As translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Automaton</strong></a>, Kojima-san recently talked about OD and the challenges the game will face in a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ananweb</strong></a>. <em>"I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We’ve created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games. This time, we’re trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging,"</em> Kojima-san said.</p>



<p>While we still don't know exactly how OD will play, according to Hideo Kojima, there's already a way to understand the experience better. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"We’ve packed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">the trailer</a></strong> full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."</em> </p>



<p>I, for one, am not ashamed to admit I haven't any clue about the game as much as anyone else. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"><strong>OD being so different from anything else</strong></a> is making me quite excited about what it will offer over traditional horror games, which deserve a major shake-up since they haven't really moved past the experience established by the Resident Evil series in any significant way.</p>



<p>As for when we will be able to understand more about OD, no one can say. With Hideo Kojima having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year (and with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/">a PC port</a></strong> likely getting announced during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>), it may be a while until the studio is ready to unveil a project that sounds more promising by the day.</p>
