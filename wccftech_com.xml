			<p><strong>New Blood Interactive </strong>co-founder and chief executive officer <strong>Dave Oshry</strong> has made a name for himself, not just as the head of the indie publisher, but on the <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry">social media platform X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he often shares his thoughts and sometimes industry insights. Today, we have the latter, as Oshry revealed the latest example of how much people <strong>hate using the Epic Games Store</strong> and would much rather use <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>In response to a meme video about how players would rather pay for a game on Steam than grab it for free off the Epic Games Store, Oshry offered a real-life example of the scenario the meme was poking fun at.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/">Blood West</a></strong> is an indie first-person shooter published by New Blood Interactive, and it was also one of the games that was given away <strong>for free on the Epic Games Store</strong> during Epic's annual holiday giveaway period, where it gives away one free game per day leading up to the new year. Blood West <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">was free for December 20, 2025</a>, and by the time the giveaway promotion had ended, it was one of the <strong>20 games</strong> that contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">Epic saving players from spending <strong>$550 </strong>if they wanted to purchase all 20 games at their full, non-sale price</a>.</p>



<p>(Speaking of free games on the Epic Games Store, as a quick aside, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/">you can currently get <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong> and <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong> for free on the store</a>.)</p>



<p>But that doesn't matter to players, because they're not using the Epic Games Store anyway. They're using Steam, and when given the chance to buy a game on sale on Steam or get it for free on the Epic Games Store, they'd rather buy it on Steam. </p>



<p>"<em>Blood West was free on EGS over the holidays and sold like 200% more on Steam that day</em>," Oshry wrote in response to the meme post. "<em>I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oshry continued to explain that when a game is made free on the Epic Games Store, Epic offers developers a lump-sum royalty payment for the period it's available for free, all of which went directly to Blood West's developer, <strong>Hyperstrange</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>New Blood doesn't get any royalties from EGS we let Hyperstrange take 100% of that - so they got the $$$ bag for the free giveaway, are putting that money into developing the new DLC and we got more Steam sales too</em>," Oshry said. In response to another user, Oshry revealed he had conducted an interview earlier in the day, where he said, "<em>Epic could give devs 100% of sales and it doesn't mean shit if there's no sales lol. WHAT'S 100% OF $0</em>."</p>



<p>Back in December, while Epic was in the middle of its end-of-year giveaways,<a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/"> <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> put it bluntly, and perhaps best:</a> "<em></em><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community</em>." Oshry's example today is just the latest to make it clear that players are choosing to stick with their communities. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Foundry Confirms Monster Hunter Wilds PC Performs ‘Thousands’ of DLC Checks That Hurt Performance, But Only in Certain Conditions]]></title>

			<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that one of the reasons <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds PC</strong> players may encounter unexpected frame rate drops is that the game checks for DLC ownership, and <strong>the less DLC you own, the worse the frame rate is going to be.</strong> That can be a problem, especially since there are dozens of cosmetic DLCs. Thankfully, after modder de_Tylmarande found this out, a fix was quickly deployed by Nexus Mods user Vaeux <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the so-called '<strong>Less DLC Checks</strong>' mod</a>. The mod requires praydog's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-modding-tool-reframework-updated-to-work-with-sunbreak-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REFramework</a></strong>, which improves and fixes various issues in <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s games built with the <strong>RE Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has investigated the issue</a> and discovered that the user's computer is indeed being hammered by <strong>'thousands' of DLC checks</strong>, which are lowering the frame rate. However, <strong>this only happens in a specific scenario</strong>: when your character is in a hub zone and one of the Support Desk felyne characters is nearby. That's because those NPCs handle the DLC menu.</p>



<p>Still, the modder's claim under said conditions is perfectly valid. Using a <strong>Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</strong> test system, the testing performed by Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter discovered that the performance boost granted by the Less DLC Checks mod got higher when the graphics settings were lowered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Maxed settings (1440p ultra, RT, DLSS balanced):</strong>&nbsp;11.4% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>High settings with RT:</strong>&nbsp;20% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>Lowest settings (DLSS ultra performance, no RT):</strong>&nbsp;25.6% performance improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The good news is that this issue only really affects the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance in the aforementioned conditions. That said, CAPCOM should absolutely fix it as soon as possible, and in a way, it's wild that a user discovered it almost a year after the game's original release.</p>

			<p><strong>Kurt Kuhlmann</strong> worked at <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> as a designer for two decades, during which time he was the co-lead designer on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></strong>, a game that could potentially go down in history as the studio's biggest hit ever. He was also known as the series "<em>loremaster</em>," and though he's no longer with Bethesda, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Kuhlmann claims he was in line to lead up <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>, and if he had it his way, we'd be looking at a major <strong>Star Wars</strong>-inspired style of game for the long-awaited entry in the Elder Scrolls series.</p>



<p>Kuhlmann was never officially offered the job of lead designer on The Elder Scrolls VI, but according to him, Bethesda boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">Todd Howard</a></strong> had verbally offered him the role following the completion of Skyrim. In fact, according to Kuhlmann, if not for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a></strong>, we would've gotten The Elder Scrolls VI a lot sooner.</p>



<p>"<em>Of course, after <strong>Fallout 4</strong> we didn't go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then we didn't make TES6, we made Starfield," </em>said Kuhlmann<em>, "which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I've been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience. <strong>Bruce [Nesmith]</strong> and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim</em>," Kuhlmann continued, "<em>I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen</em>. <em>And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead.</em>"</p>



<p>Not being given the lead was what stamped home the reality for Kuhlmann that "<em>what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point</em>," when it finally came to pass that the studio would focus on The Elder Scrolls VI. That, alongside the fact that Bethesda had grown to a point where it functioned in a way that wasn't compatible with how he preferred to operate, contributed to his leaving in 2023.</p>



<p>But if he had been given the lead, and if he had it his way? The story we would've gotten in his version of the game would've been the "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment for The Elder Scrolls. </p>



<p>"<em>I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</em>," said Kuhlmann. By the end of it, the Thalmor, the elven supremacists who were on the fringes of Skyrim's story, would've seemed to have won, save for the player doing something at the very end of the story to leave a hopeful, cliffhanger ending that would lead into The Elder Scrolls VII. "<em>So you've preserved hope for the future, but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march</em>."</p>



<p>Kuhlmann admits that he doesn't believe his idea would've gone far with the rest of the team. Making a game is not like making a movie. After waiting more than a decade for The Elder Scrolls VI, if it ended with evil winning, and a cliffhanger for good potentially succeeding in the next game, which could very well be another decade away, players might not have appreciated it as much as Kuhlmann. "<em>That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years</em>," Kuhlmann said.</p>



<p>Still, it's interesting to hear Kuhlmann's side of the story, and to hear a little more insight into The Elder Scrolls VI, which we've not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">since its far-too-early reveal back in <strong>2018</strong></a>. Now that Starfield is out of the way, at least we know the studio is working on it, as Todd Howard and other Bethesda executives <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">can say nothing more than "<em>it's going</em>"</a> and that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">the game is still "<em>a long way off</em>"</a> when it comes to the game's development progress.</p>



<p>And while Kuhlmann may be right that players wouldn't have loved his Empire Strikes Back, the reality is that no matter what Bethesda does, it won't be able to live up to expectations, as former Bethesda artist <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>Nate Purkeypile</strong> rightly calls the game a "<em>no-win</em>" situation</a>. </p>
