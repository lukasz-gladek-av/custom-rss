			<p>Grinding Gear Games released <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile 2 </a>in early access last December, and hardcore ARPG fans have praised it for fulfilling their desire for a challenge that Diablo IV has been unable to satisfy. Today, in an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pathofexile">extensive live stream</a>, the studio delved into the many changes coming in its Third Edict update, which goes live at the end of this month on August 29, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll also be going live as part of a free weekend promotion, so if you've been curious about trying Path of Exile 2 for yourself, you'll be able to jump in alongside veterans of the game's early access period when the new update goes live.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes in this update include the removal of the Cruel difficulty level, with the studio introducing three interlude acts that players can go through as part of changes to the endgame experience. The introduction of trading is also, of course, major news for the player base.</p>



<p>The introduction of a new act, however, with Act IV being added to the game with this update, is the headlining addition for most players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Third Edict is the addition of a new league, Secrets of Abyssal, which introduces a number of cool features for how players can adjust and re-adjust their character builds. </p>



<p>The full patch notes will reveal all of the specifics that hardcore fans of the series will want to dig into, but those won't arrive until a bit closer to the update's launch next week. For now, you can pore over the live stream and look forward to what's to come in Path of Exile 2 next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal battle around Subnautica 2 between Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill and their former parent company KRAFTON continues, as the studio that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire all co-founded, Unknown Worlds, has now <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">filed a lawsuit against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire</a>.</p>



<p>This comes <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/">a little more than a week after KRAFTON filed its own lawsuit</a> against Gill, Cleveland and McGuire, and since Unknown Worlds is wholly owned by KRAFTON, it appears that this suit is meant to pile on even more pressure on the three co-founders.</p>



<p>This new suit also includes what appear to be Slack messages meant to back KRAFTON's claims that Cleveland and McGuire were no longer working on Subanutica 2, and that they had moved on to personal projects while the rest of the team was left to pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">filing their lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire haven't added anything to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">long list of events </a>that encompass this story, and it's worth asking where this suit from Unknown Worlds originates.</p>



<p>It carries many of the same allegations that KRAFTON already laid out in its own filing, that Cleveland and McGuire allegedly "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds, which impacted development on Subnautica 2, and that the co-founders were prepared to release a sub-standard version of Subnautica 2 in the interest of earning the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that has been at the centre of this entire dispute.</p>



<p>"<em>Acting out of pure self-interest, the Key Employees pushed to release any game - even one that was underdeveloped and had received a litany of disappointing reviews - into circulation on a timeline that maximized their earnout, even if it meant disappointing Subnautica's devoted fans and damaging the franchise</em>," the suit reads. </p>



<p>Is this just KRAFTON adding more pressure and filing a second time under the Unknown Worlds name, because it can, or does the driving force of Unknown Worlds filing its own lawsuit stem from members of staff genuinely taking umbrage with their former bosses? The truth of the matter is unclear, and though we tried asking KRAFTON about the intentions behind this suit and if it aligns with the views of Unknown Worlds staff, we received no response prior to publication. We'll update this story if we do hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, what is clear is that we are in the long haul for this dispute, and there are some questions about this situation that we may never learn the real answers to.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-might-not-launch-until-late-2027-as-cloud-chamber-reportedly-loses-80-people-in-layoffs.1276428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, at the time of this writing, before the Gamescom ONL 2025 craze started, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/">BioShock 4 developer Cloud Chamber was suffering layoffs</a> and letting go of an unspecified number of staff. At the same time, we learned that former Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, would be taking over as the new studio head. </p>



<p>Today, Take-Two confirmed the cuts, but it was Schreier who added that the cuts would affect 80 members of Cloud Chamber's 250-person team. What's more, this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE">new report from Schreier</a> also reveals that BioShock 4 might not arrive until mid-to-late 2027.</p>



<p>An internal email from 2K president David Ismailer was shared with Bloomberg, in which Ismailer commented on the decision-making process behind the layoffs, but stopped short of directly saying how many people were impacted. </p>



<p>Ismailer wrote, "<em>While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a </em><em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p>



<p>"<em>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you'll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources. There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work."</em></p>



<p>According to the sources Schreier spoke to, BioShock 4 had an internal release target of "<em>late 2026 or early 2027</em>," but thanks to this restructuring, that timeline has been pushed back further, and now the game might not arrive until sometime in mid-to-late 2027, if it arrives in 2027 at all. And even if it does make a 2027 release window, that'll still mean the game was in development for over a decade.</p>



<p>Schreier's report goes on to discuss a number of the issues Cloud Chamber has faced in that time, including a challenge that we've seen other studios fail to overcome, which is attempting to build a big-budget, triple-A game while also building up a new studio at the same time.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, to say the least, to see what has become of a game that, more than a decade ago, players were extremely excited to play. It's worth wondering whether BioShock 4 will have the same impact in 2027 that it would have had in, say, 2016, which would have been three years after BioShock Infinite's launch. </p>



<p>At this point, Take-Two has far too much invested to stop now, or at least it definitely feels like we're past the point where the game could just be killed without ever launching. Hopefully, Fergusson and the remaining team can pull something together. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Unveils DirectX Advanced Shader Delivery to Combat Shader Stuttering]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-combat-shader-stuttering/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-unveils-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-to-combat-shader-stuttering.1276425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft's DirectX team <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a new feature called Advanced Shader Delivery. This feature will make its debut on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds (now officially inbound <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">on October 16</a> for $549.99 and $899.99, respectively), but it will eventually roll out to regular PCs. A dedicated AgilitySDK will be released to game developers next month, allowing them to integrate the functionality in their upcoming and even existing games.</p>



<p>The purpose of Advanced Shader Delivery, which was co-developed with Xbox and AMD, is to address one of the banes of PC gamers: shader stuttering. The DirectX team said:</p>



<p><em>We have partnered with teams across Xbox and at AMD to precompile this data and distribute it at download time for key titles via the Xbox PC app This approach not only gets you into your games faster, but it also prevents most instances of stutter that cause performance issues.</em> <em>As an example, in Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed, our engineering teams observed launch times reduced by as much as 85%. This not only means you’re playing your game faster, but your battery life is spent on playtime, not compiling.</em></p>



<p>The process involves a new method of collecting shader data from any game and packaging it in a new, standardized format called a State Object Database (SODB). The DirectX engineers successfully separated the shader compiler from the graphics driver and united the game data in the SODB with the compiler in the cloud to create a Precompiled Shader Database (PSDB). The PSDB can then be distributed by the Xbox Store alongside the game, supplementing the shader cache. When a game runs for the first time, it sees that all the necessary shaders are already available in a Windows cache and can therefore skip the compilation step on the gaming device. If a device receives a driver update, the app will detect this and automatically update the shader cache.</p>





<figure></figure>



<p>The caveat is that in the beginning, this will only work on titles distributed via the Xbox app, not Steam (or the Epic Games Store, GOG, Ubisoft Connect, etc.). However, other storefronts may eventually integrate the feature via the upcoming AgilitySDK.</p>



<p>It'll be intriguing to see whether Advanced Shader Delivery can truly help with solving the issue of shader stuttering in PC games.</p>
