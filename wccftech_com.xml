			<p>The latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-pc-ray-tracing/">major update</a> for GTA Online has been released and is now available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The update is called Agents of Sabotage. There is plenty of content to get stuck into in this new update, with the Darnell Bros Garment Factory being a major focus for the update. To be able to get started with this mission, answer Pavel's call, then take a trip to the Garment Factory in east Los Santos. Alternatively, you can use the Maze Bank Foreclosures in-game website to get started. When you arrive, you'll notice that the Garment Factory has a Mk II Weapon Workshop, Personal Quarters, a passive income safe, ten Personal Vehicle storage slots, and much more to make this HQ yours to enjoy.</p>

<p>Along with this is The FIB Files, which is a set of four new multi-stage endeavors, where players are tasked with taking down an IAA-protected aircraft while stealing military tech from Fort Zancudo, participating in a break-in to recover missing artwork, and getting access to Maze Bank's secret slush fund. Players will be able to participate in these missions once they've introduced themselves to the necessary NPCs in the factory space. You'll also need the Darnell Inc. app installed on your iFruit, which will then give you access to The FIB Files.</p>
<p>While these are the main focuses of the Agents of Sabotage update, there are also new vehicles for you to enjoy. This includes the Banshee GTS (free to claim for GTA+ Members through January 8), Chavos V6, Dinka Jester RR Widebody, as well as law enforcement versions of the Canis Terminus Patrol and Vapid Caracara Pursuit.</p>
<p>Jodi is now able to add several new upgrades to the Benefactor Terrorbyte, which is now also able to be stored inside the Garment Factory thanks to the latest update. By teaming up with Jodi, Bureau Tech allows you to have exclusive mods to the Terrorbyte, which can make undertaking certain missions easier, as well as avoiding the attacks of other players. This includes a Collectible Scanner, which will alert you to Playing Cards, Action Figures, Movie Props, and more. The Terrorbyte will now also be able to have a Missile Lock-On Jammer, which prevents other players from locking on to the vehicle. This has added compatibility with 50 popular vehicles in the game.</p>
<p>For more information about what the Agents of Sabotage update has in store for GTA Online, you can check out the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/399a19ka9935ok/gta-online-agents-of-sabotage-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newswire on the Rockstar Games</a> website, which goes into some of the finer details of the major update for the game, as well as providing some screenshots of cosmetics that you'll be able to obtain in the new update.</p>

			<p>Today, The Outlast Trials received a brand new major update named <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">Project Breach</a>, which introduces the story of asylum escapee Amelia Collier, a character who is fueled by grief and anger and purposefully infiltrates the Murkoff Corporation to try and take them down to stop their grotesque experiments. Amelia is voiced by Caroline Dhavernas,&nbsp; best known for her role in Hannibal, as well as being the narrator in the game Child of light. This update has added a ton of content for those who want a brand-new challenge, as well as those who like to get more of the story. If you want to see what you're in for, make sure to check out the Project Breach trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials - Project Breach | New Update Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWjTZldpEjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This large update for The Outlast Trials includes a brand new trial for players to explore, called "Pleasure the Prosecutor." There is also a new environment that takes you Downtown, where you get to see Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi in action as the murderous man-child he is with his teeth-filled shotgun. There are also new challenges to participate in for those who like to be kept on their toes during intense scenes of survival. This includes reuniting the orphan with their mother and father in Reunite the Family, and de-cluttering your mind in Deface the Futtermans.</p>
<p>This update also adds a new player ability, which will be highly beneficial for those trying to survive in the Trials provided by Murkoff. This ability is called the Jammer Rig and allows you to disable electronic devices. This is good for players who know how to stay calm under pressure and will enable you to make strategic plays in the Trial.</p>
<p>Project Breach sees a new enemy added to The Outlast Trials, with the enemy being called The Molotov. This enemy has the ability to use a powerful ranged weapon that hurls Molotov Cocktails at the players, which explode on impact, creating large areas of fire that are a danger to those involved in the Trial.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy cosmetics, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Unholy Night DLC pack</a>, which includes a set of eight Legendary Outfits, items, and art that you can use to decorate your cell, as well as some player icons to utilize in The Outlast Trials. If this is something that interests you, it can now be purchased for $19.99.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are also limited-time Trial variations thanks to the Winter Kills event that is currently taking place in the game.</p>

			<p>Today, developer and publisher Owlcat Games has officially announced that Patch 1.3 is available for Warhammer 40,000:<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/"> Rogue Trader</a>. The game has officially turned a year old and is celebrating its first anniversary, and what better way to do so than with a massive update that benefits PC and console players? If you prefer to find out about the new update for Rogue Trader in a video, then make sure to check out the Rogue Trader Anniversary trailer below. Throughout the year, the team has made sure to take on feedback from the dedicated community and make their voices heard by making necessary changes and adding new content to keep the game fresh for new and returning players. Today, the new patch brings in a ton of new changes and quality-of-life improvements. Most importantly, the co-op mode in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is now available for up to 6 people on console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Birthday report from Abelard | Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9Qm6RBj6G0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patch 1.3 is the biggest update in the game thus far and has added over 1000+ visible and internal changes, which include adding lots of new cutscenes to the game for players to enjoy, as well as significant improvements to the pre-existing cutscenes in the game. There are also new items for players to experiment with, providing those who are playing Rogue Trader with a further diversified experience that isn't reliant on just a couple of items.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new voiceover has been added, which will be experienced predominantly in dialogue with Kibellah as well as companion banter with Kibellah. Alongside this, the character models for both Heinrix and Abelard have been updated.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg of content that has been added to the game, with a lot of it being focused on improving pre-existing content in the games, such as the Conviction point rebalance, as well as improvement of loot tables in Act I and II, so that players get to have better item progression, as well as a diversified experience, which is also helped by the large quantity of items added to the game.</p>
