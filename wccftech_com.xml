			<p>Squeezing itself in <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-clair-obscur-hades-2-the-game-awards-players-voice-awards-nominees/">just before The Game Awards</a>, 11 bit Studios has announced that it will host its first-ever digital showcase next week on December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. It'll be livestreamed on the studio's YouTube channel and in partnership with IGN on its YouTube channel, featuring new looks at Frostpunk 2 DLC, new content coming to The Alters, and more.</p>



<p>The publisher and developer will include information on games it worked on in both capacities, with its published titles like Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and Death Howl making an appearance, along with games it developed, like the aforementioned The Alters and Frostpunk 2. A press release for the event also includes that "<em>there may be a surprise or two in there, of course</em>."  </p>



<p>Hot off the release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which currently sits at a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam and just ahead of releasing Death Howl, 2025 has been a strong year for 11 bit Studios. The team has wins in both its publishing and development branches, with Moonlighter 2 representing the publishing win and The Alters representing its development win.</p>



<p>And that's even with The Alters getting caught up in one of the year's many scandals around developers using generative AI and not disclosing it. 11 bit Studios was caught using the technology for localization and a couple of small art assets, which did sour the game for some players, but that hasn't stopped it from being one of the highest-rated games in 2025, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=2">with an 85 on Metacritic and the 46th best 2025 release</a> as sorted by Metacritic score (technically, it's listed at 48th, but that's with Metacritic including re-releases of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom at the top).</p>



<p>This showcase is the chance for the studio to end 2025 off with a bang, since the showcase will not only do its best to get players amped for what it has coming down the pipeline, but it also coincides with the release of Frostpunk 2's first major DLC, Fractured Utopias.</p>



<p>We'll see if 11 bit Studios is able to stick the landing this coming Monday, December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</p>

			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is getting a new DLC expansion in just two days from the time of this writing, with the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/"> The Forsaken Hollows DLC</a> arriving on December 4, 2025. The DLC was announced last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">just as players were complaining about a lack of content</a> in Nightreign.</p>



<p>The Undertaker is one of two new characters added in the DLC, with today's trailer showcasing an impressive flying move where the Undertaker charges into enemies through the air, with a direct hit stunning even the more terrifying bosses.</p>



<p>When the DLC was announced last month, the Undertaker was described as a character featuring "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>," which this trailer definitely leans into with her swinging a heavy weapon around. In a press release, FromSoftware adds that she "<em>lets her faith be the hammer that purges the darkness festering in Limveld</em>."</p>

<iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows | Undertaker Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8qzE__2TTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds a second new playable character, the Scholar, and two new bosses for players to fight with these new characters. It also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that opened in Limveld and isn't exactly a whole new map, but it seems to at least be a new area of Limveld for players to explore.</p>



<p>Overall, it'll be interesting to see how players respond to the Forsaken Hollows. If you didn't purchase the deluxe edition of Elden Ring Nightreign, then you'll have to pick up this DLC separately as a paid expansion for $15 USD. It's not the biggest ask, but after months of players complaining that Nightreign lacked post-launch support, arriving late to the party with two new characters, two new bosses, and a new sub-area might not be what players had in mind when thinking about what they would expect from paid DLC.</p>



<p>Of course, those who absolutely devour new content within the first few days of its release aren't the example to use for how the community feels about the new DLC overall; you can practically write the Steam reviews now for the players that have tens of hours in Nightreign already, who will complete all the new content within two days of its launch, complaining that there wasn't more to do.</p>



<p>That said, it's not unfair to say that if Nightreign wants to maintain the commercial success it achieved in 2025, FromSoftware will likely need to do more for it than it currently is.</p>
