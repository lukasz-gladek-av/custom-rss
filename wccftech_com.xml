			<p>Former Criterion developers who worked on series like Need for Speed and Burnout at Fuse Games have announced a different kind of fast-paced arcade racer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a game that doesn't seem to entirely rely on pod racing with a mix of pods and classic speeders, arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Developed by Fuse Games and published by Secret Mode, Star Wars: Galactic Racer was the second Star Wars game to be revealed at The Game Awards tonight, and is the sixth Star Wars game in development that we know about.</p>



<p>Compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic (the other newly announced Star Wars game)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">the third Star Wars Jedi game</a>, Galactic Racer appears to be bringing a bit more variety to the Star Wars games we have to look forward to.</p>

<p>"<em>For us, </em><em>Star Wars</em> has always represented the power of wonder—and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> is one of its most thrilling expressions," said Matt Webster, chief executive officer at Fuse Games, in a press release. "<em>With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, we wanted to reinvent what a racing game can be: adventurous, spectacular and exhilarating. We want every race to feel alive with dynamic risk-reward choices, and every victory to feel incredible</em>."</p>



<p>Vice president and general manager at Lucasfilm, Douglas Reilly, added, "<em>From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy. With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll be able to build and customize your ride as you join the Galactic League to rise from your state as a lone racer in the Outer Rim to a household name among racing fans across the galaxy. It's a runs-based racing game "<em>where no two runs are the same</em>." </p>
