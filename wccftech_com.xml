            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a> claims that 200 developers at Candy Crush studio King are at the risk of being laid off as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's latest mass layoff</a>, and will be replaced by the AI tools they were told to build.</p>



<p>King is the mobile division of Activision Blizzard King, and arguably was the division out of Microsoft's ABK acquisition that its gaming team needed the most, since Microsoft lacked any presence in the mobile gaming industry. Buying the studio that makes Candy Crush, one of the biggest and most well-known mobile games around the world, changed that overnight. </p>



<p>But as it's been<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/"> reported multiple times</a>, Microsoft's cuts are allegedly not concerned with anything beyond the company wanting to get ahead, and stay ahead<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsofts-in-house-ai-chip-delayed-as-firm-worried-about-losing-to-nvidia-in-competitiveness/">, in the AI race</a>. Now, this report from MobileGamer.biz shows the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> inevitable endgame that every bean counter pushing AI and generative AI tools has in mind, being put into practice</a>. That every part of the job they currently pay people to do can be replaced by an AI tool.</p>



<p>"<em>Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker</em>," said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that certain employees are being targeted and getting laid off for "<em>arbitrary reasons</em>," with a source claiming that people who have been vocally speaking out against decisions made by leadership are now set to lose their jobs. A different source in the report claims that the HR department at King is "<em>an absolute shitshow and has been for years. An extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff</em>."</p>



<p>So far, the line from any company that's implementing generative AI tools into their game development process, King included, has always been that the AI tool will take care of the more tedious, mundane tasks, while the human developers can focus on the more complex, creativity-focused parts of making games. Reporter for The Logic, Brendan Sinclair, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brendansinclair.bsky.social/post/3ltytlpz3ws2s">pointed out that just last year,</a> King's director of AI labs, Sahar Asadi, had that exact message as part of her talk at GDC 2024. </p>



<p>Now, those designers who were supposed to have more time to be creative, are being replaced entirely by these AI tools. An internal memo sent out to King developers claims that these cuts  are about "<em>making several changes to get the business back to growth" </em>and that "<em>unlocking many more AI tools"</em> is one element of that. It also goes on to explain that this is about having "<em>fewer layers, fewer overlapping remits, fewer hours spent on alignment, fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project</em>."</p>



<p>According to a source in the report, it could be the case that more than 200 developers are cut from King, impacting the Candy Crush team, half of the Farm Heroes Saga team, and developers working in London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin-based studios. </p>



<p>"<em>The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it's all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,</em>" said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-steam-deck-performance-boost/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-plugin-for-steam-deck-delivers-up-to-4x-performance-boost-in-both-native-and-emulated-games.1243884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin is now available, allowing users to boost performance in native and emulated games by up to four times.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by Deck Wizard provides a quick overview of the new plugin, the installation procedure and how it can be used to improve performance via frame generation with the 2x, 3x and 4x options. The video also shows some quick tests for multiple games, including Elden Ring, which can run at over 80 FPS on the system with the proper settings, Okami HD, and Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster, which can both run at above their 30 FPS lock. The plugin can also be used to improve performance in emulated games, as shown with Shadow of the Colossus.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lossless Scaling Frame Generation has made incredible progress since its release, adding, over time, a 3x and 4x options which work decently enough, but are in no way on par with NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, unsurprisingly. The 2x option, on the other hand, has been improved so much that in some games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, it is almost on part with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation. As such, the app is an excellent choice for all those using previous generations NVIDIA GPUs like the RTX 2000 and 3000 series that will never get official Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>More information on the Lossless Scaling Frame Generation Steam Deck plugin can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TwvHdVucC3">Discord server</a>. The app is available for purchase <span>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">Steam</a> right now</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is coming next month right at the beginning of this year's Gamescom.</p>



<p>A new worldwide reveal of the next entry in the popular series has been confirmed for this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be held on August 19th from 2:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT / 8:00 PM CEST, host Geoff Keighley confirmed. This confirmation is rather interesting, as usually, reveals for the new entries in the Call of Duty series are held separately from bigger events, so there's still the chance that an event focused on the game could be coming at a later time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS 7 worldwide reveal at Opening Night Live kicks off <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> in a massive way.</p><p>Tuesday, August 19.</p><p>Streaming live everywhere at 2p ET / 11a PT / 8p CEST. <a href="https://t.co/6HfSTirTze">pic.twitter.com/6HfSTirTze</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1944804083300270541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The confirmation of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal for Gamescom Opening Night is not completely surprising, despite no longer happening with a dedicated event focused on the game, as it was teased last month that the game would be shown again this Summer. The only look at the game to date was provided with a teaser shown at the end of this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase, which set the tone for the next entry in the series and for its 2035 future setting. It was also confirmed shortly after the showcase that the campaign will be entirely playable in co-op.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6, Xbox Next Won’t See Widespread Adoption Of DirectX 12 Work Graphs, Especially in the Cross-Gen Period – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-work-graphs-adoption-cross-gen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-xbox-next-won%E2%80%99t-see-widespread-adoption-of-directx-12-work-graphs-especially-in-the-cross-gen-period-%E2%80%93-rumor.1243851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature will be part of next-gen game development, it won't see massive adoption on PlayStation 6 and the next generation Xbox, especially in the cross-generation period.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627665">commented</a> on the possibility of next-generation consoles having access to the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature, which delivers better performance and improved scalbility across complex workloads including procedural generation, particle systems and AI logic, saying that while <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627867">hardware and API will be ready</a>, it is unlikely to see widespread adoption, as the engines and tools currently in use don't support this style of graphics programming. As such, it will be a while to see if the feature will bring significant performance improvements on consoles that go well beyond what we have already seen on PC<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-performance-boost/"> shortly after its release.</a></p>



<p>Very little is currently known about next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft, other than the fact that they are in the works. While rumors on the next Xbox are scarce, there's been considerably more unconfirmed information on the PlayStation 6, which is supposedly launching in two different editions - a home console and a portable system speculated to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/">more powerful than the Xbox Series S </a>that will be able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">run PlayStation 5 games natively</a>, although performance may not be great without developer intervention.</p>
