			<p>Along with the unveiling of NVIDIA's GeForce <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-429-8-gb-379-20-percent-faster-4060-ti-2x-dlss-4/">RTX 5060Ti</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-8-gb-sweet-spot-gaming-299-over-100-fps-games-1080p/">RTX 5060</a>, we also got the announcement of the next four games that have added support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Offworld Industries' <a href="https://wccftech.com/squad-44-is-post-scriptums-new-name-update-adds-greek-faction-new-map-and-weapons/">SQUAD</a>, Misultin Studios and MicroProse Software's EXFIL and Torn Banner Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/">No More Room In Hell 2</a> join the ranks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-in-warhammer-40k-darktide-enlisted-and-karma-the-dark-world/">games</a> like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/">Control</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> in supporting DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-black-myth-wukong/">blog post</a> from NVIDIA, each game enjoys a performance boost, but the biggest headway seems to be made in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Players pushing 4K, with everything maxed out, while utilizing an RTX 50 series GPU "<em>can multiply performance up to 10X thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution,</em>" NVIDIA claims.</p>
<p>"<em>At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled and every other setting maxed out, DLSS Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution multiply frame rates by an average of 10X. This massive performance boost enables GeForce RTX 5070 gamers to play at over 110 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users to play at over 130 FPS, GeForce RTX 5080 owners to play at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5090 buyers to play at over 240 FPS, maxing out the capabilities of the latest 4K OLED G-SYNC compatible DisplayPort 2.1 displays.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, the performance boost you're able to see will always depend on the hardware you have in your system, but even considering that, it's still an impressive bump for what many players find challenging to run.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was one of the biggest titles in 2024, winning its fair share of awards, including the game of the year for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Golden Joysticks</a>. It's also one of the sleekest-looking games in recent years if you've got the hardware for it. Now that it supports DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation, more players will be able to enjoy its wonderful visuals without losing frames as they would have before.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada should start next week, according to a very reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known leaker <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billbil-kun</a> revealed that from what they can see through some Canadian retailers, pre-orders for the next-generation Nintendo console and bundles launching this June will start next week, on April 23rd. Unfortunately, the leaker couldn't confirm if pre-orders in the United States will also begin next week.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the whole of North America were supposed to start last week, but they were ultimately delayed in the United States first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">assess the potential impact of tariffs</a>. Pre-orders in Canada were later delayed in order to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">align with the timing of pre-orders in the US</a>, so there's a good chance that those living in the United States may be able to pre-order the console next week if pre-orders in Canada will indeed begin on April 23rd.</p>
<p>If the current situation doesn't change, there's little doubt that the tariffs will impact the Nintendo Switch 2 price, although it is not yet known in which capacity. An internal assessment memo from a major Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia suggests that the console is in<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> line for a significant price increase</a> as long as game consoles made in China will be subject to a 145% tariff in the United States. The PlayStation 5 could also see a price increase in the United States due to the tariffs, a price increase that would follow the one announced for the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">this week.</a></p>
