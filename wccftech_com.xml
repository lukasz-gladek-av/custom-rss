			<p>Bandai Namco hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/">Little Nightmares Showcase</a> today, which the company announced was happening just last week, and it revealed a lot more than what players originally expected.</p>
<p>The expectation was that it would be a showcase focused on Little Nightmares III, with new gameplay and a release date revealed, which did happen. Bandai and Supermassive Games announced that Little Nightmares III will arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on <strong>October 10, 2025.</strong> We also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2baUKpm5k">10-minute look at gameplay</a> from a Carnevale level in the game, and the confirmation that it'll also release on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was the announcement of several new Little Nightmares projects.</p>

<p>Firstly, a remaster of the original game, Little Nightmares: Enhanced Edition, was announced, though in a bit of an odd way.</p>
<p>The remaster will arrive on all platforms on October 10, same as Little Nightmares III. Players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC will be able to play the game at a 4K resolution at 60 FPS, with improved graphics, ray-traced reflections, faster loading times, revised checkpoints, and new assistance mechanics.</p>
<p>But if you want to experience the original game with all of that right now, you can, by pre-ordering a digital version of Little Nightmares III. To be clear, this enhanced edition remaster <strong>will not be out</strong> for players to buy separately for $39.99 until October. But pre-order LN3, and you'll get access to it "<em>immediately</em>," as part of your pre-order purchase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - Comparative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6bX6GUEqFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the one hand, it's not a bad deal to get the new version of the original and the next game in the series at no extra cost when you pre-order the third game. The Enhanced Edition of the first game is available for pre-ordering any edition of LN3, from the standard to the premium collectors edition. On the other hand, the enhanced edition Tarsier did for <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-ii-tease-gamescom/">Little Nightmares II</a> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/little-nightmares-ii-enhanced-edition-out-today-on-ps5/">free</a> for those who already owned the game, which is not the case with the enhanced edition of the first Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been mixed online, though it'll be interesting to see if fans attempt to push Bandai Namco to make this new enhanced edition available now for players who want to get it without pre-ordering the third game.</p>
<p>The next major news of the showcase was a Little Nightmares VR game called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes. Very little about this game was revealed, with Bandai only showing a short teaser trailer.</p>

<p>The other new projects revealed were a new audio podcast, called The Sounds of Little Nightmares. A comic series, called Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, and a novel, called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Little Nightmares Descent to Nowhere - Comic Book Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FK30jqgA_oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, five Little Nightmares projects were revealed, on top of the news we already expected with the release date for Little Nightmares III. There was even a small teaser for a sixth project for the series that looked like it could potentially be a stop-motion film or TV adaptation. We can't say for sure, because the teaser was inserted partway through the showcase, and not discussed again. Hopefully, we'll hear more about it soon.</p>

			<p>Techland has <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">announced</a> that its Dying Light: Retouched update, a free update bringing a few significant enhancements to the original Dying Light, will be live and available on all platforms in just two days from this writing, on June 26, 2025.</p>
<p>The Retouched update is something fans of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-10th-anniversary-qa-with-franchise-director-tymon-smektala/"> Dying Light</a> series have been looking forward to since it was first announced at the beginning of this year, though Techland is clear on the point that it is not a remaster. These are enhancements to the original game, as part of Techland celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the first game's launch.</p>
<p>Tymon Smektała, Dying Light's franchise director says that the update "<em>is about squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love. it's not a complete overhaul or remaster</em>."</p>
<p>Technical game director at Techland, Grzegorz Świstowski adds "<em>Over the past couple of years, we've added a lot, customized a lot, and learned how to squeeze more from the tech we already have. One day, someone just started applying those learning to some old assets - and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game</em>."</p>
<p>Overall, the update adds plenty of visual updates to the game, as much as Techland was able to do for a decade-old game from a different generation of consoles and PCs. Players with keen eyes will notice the difference in textures for small details like the cement floors and wooden walls. According to the developer blog from Smektała, many of the upgrades in this update have been added by hand, which shows in the quality comparison featured in the blog.</p>
<p>Other improvements added in the update come from the audio, with the game's original composer, Paweł Blaszczak, returning to remaster the entire soundtrack. There's even new tracks added to the game, woven into the original soundtrack and score.</p>
<p>The update is free for all platforms for players who already own the first game, including last-gen consoles like PS4 and Xbox One, though Smektała notes that "<em>The level of changes may vary by platform.</em>" Basically, don't expect the PS4 version to look as good as the PS5 version.</p>
