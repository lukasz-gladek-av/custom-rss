			<p>Hitman developer IO Interactive has made the decision to cut ties with the MMA fighter Conor McGregor after last week's Irish High Court ruling where he was found to be guilty of assaulting and raping a woman in December 2018. The decision to cut ties comes shortly after a collaboration between IO Interactive and McGregor was confirmed, where he would be a character in the Hitman series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-featuring-conor-mcgregor-attracts-large-player-base/">The Disruptor</a>. His voice and likeness were used for the character, where he was featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. There was a mission available, as well as a DLC pack that would provide permanent access to an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor and new cosmetics. However, since the ruling, IO Interactive has made the decision to cut all ties and will be removing all content featuring McGregor from the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This statement</a> was made via social media this afternoon, where IO posted their announcement on X. The statement goes on to say: "In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. e take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>The Disruptor most recently returned to the Hitman game earlier this month as a limited-time mission that players would be able to participate in, with the mission set to be playable until 8 December. However, all of this will now be removed from the game. For those who own The Disruptor DLC, it hasn't been stated what will happen to the content since it's already been purchased. However, in cases like these, where content is removed regardless of circumstance, those who already own it tend to be able to continue to access it.</p>
<p>With the Irish Jury deciding what they did, McGregor was ordered to pay at least 248k Euro in damages. Despite this, he's also said that he plans to appeal the verdict. As there's no date as to when this will happen, it's hard to say what IO Interactive would be able to do about the situation should McGregor be successful in his appeal of last week's court ruling. For now though, people will no longer be able to purchase any content relating to the athlete for the unforeseeable.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, like its predecessor, hasn't been released on Xbox consoles so far, but it definitely sounds like the door is still open to seeing the Remake trilogy on Microsoft consoles in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-director-is-an-xbox-fan-and-with-square-enix-testing-the-multiplatform-waters-he-says-he-wants-to-being-the-jrpg-to-as-many-players-out-there-as-possible/">GamesRadar+</a> shortly before taking the stage at this year's Golden Joystick Awards, game director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the trilogy as a whole, saying that while nothing could be announced at the time, he certainly wants to bring the Final Fantasy VII remake series to as many players as possible. As such, they want to "create that situation, that environment, where more players can play the games in the future, and we want to look in that direction."</p>
<p>Square Enix changing its stance on platform exclusivity, which already produced some results with the release of select titles that missed Xbox consoles at launch, isn't an isolated happening but an industry-wide change, according to the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director. With so many platforms available, it is no longer possible to release a game on a single platform and get most of the players wanting to play such a game on that single platform. Giving his personal opinion on the matter, Hamaguchi-san, owning an Xbox console, praised it as a great hardware platform, so it definitely sounds like there wouldn't be any resistance on his part to get the game out on Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Despite having only released Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">earlier this year,</a> Naoki Hamaguchi and his team are already hard at work on the third and final part of the remake trilogy.<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"> The story and concept for the game are already completed</a>, so hopefully, it won't take much to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of Cloud's story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-owners-to-get-exclusive-content-in-the-coming-seasons.1044507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-owners-to-get-exclusive-content-in-the-coming-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion will continuously deliver exclusive content to owners throughout the coming season. The news was confirmed by Blizzard Diablo Franchise Manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/480711/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-exclusive-season-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Because we know that the beginning of a season is sort of a fresh starting point, we wanted to launch the expansion at the same time as the beginning of a season. That’s why we launched at the beginning of season 6, so you could roll a Spiritborn as your new thing. So it can feel like a little bit like this expansion is just a single moment in time, and I just wanted to highlight that that’s not the case. We’re going to continue to develop features that will be, essentially, exclusive to Vessel of Hatred owners. As we continue chapter two, as a Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred owner, you’ll get access to other stuff in chapter two as part of your ownership. So we’re going to continue to have Vessel of Hatred be valuable beyond season 6 as well.</em></p>
<p>This actually began with the launch of Vessel of Hatred. Runewords are, so far, exclusive to owners of the expansion, and more Runewords will be added with Season 7. As we reported last week, Patch 2.1 will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on the Public Test Realm, delivering the long-awaited Armory feature, brand new Witch-like powers, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diablo IV is currently enjoying a free trial for both the expansion and the main game itself, up to level 25. On this subject, Fergusson explained:</p>
<p><em>We were looking at ways of creating a boost for players to be able to say, Hey, welcome back, Eternal player. Maybe you haven’t played in a while. Let’s get you cleaned up. Let’s give you a shave and haircut here. So you don’t have to do all the 'I got to spend two hours just cleaning up before I can go and play'. In the last 18 months, so much has changed. But if you’re an Eternal player who played the campaign and then stopped, you don’t know. You haven’t felt this 18 months of evolution.</em></p>
