			<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong> is set to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/"> January 30, 2026</a></strong>, but you can start playing it a week early when the Character Creator Demo launches on January 23, 2026. The news of the demo arrived alongside a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough trailer and the release of several previews for the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">including one from Wccftech</a>. </p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough trailer is a solid showcase of what to expect when Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">arrives at the end of the month</a>. It goes through new elements of the combat, like the new dual blades, allowing for agile and deadly combos, or the tried-and-true halbred making its Code Vein debut. </p>



<p>It also shows off Sunken Pylon, a new area in Code Vein II that players will explore as they search for the key to purifying the Sunken City. The trailer also introduces another new combat mechanic for Code Vein II, Forma. These new special skills are broken down into three categories: weapons, defensive, and bequeathed, which consume a resource called Icor.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You'll gain Icor when attacking enemies, and when you have enough, you can use one of your Forma skills to unleash fatal and devastating attacks. The trailer also shows how you can switch between summoning and assimilation. Summoning allows your partner to fight alongside you, while assimilation fuses them to you and boosts your own health and stats. </p>



<p>The whole video is a good breakdown of what to expect in Code Vein II, but if you want to hear more about the game, then you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out Kai Tatsumoto's preview</a>, where they talked about several aspects of the game, including its combat, saying, "<em>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.</em>"</p>



<p>And of course, if you're keen to dive in, then be sure to download the demo when it arrives on January 23, 2026. The character you create can be transferred into the full game, meaning you can get a head start on your playthrough and start getting a feel for the game a week ahead of launch.</p>

			<p>What's surprising about <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't that it's a popular game that sold well; <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">there was a lot of hype leading up to its launch</a>, and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> already <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">had a lot of great feedback from the beta tests it ran</a>. Its staying power and continued upward momentum are what's surprising, as no one could have predicted it would continue to be one of the most-played games on Steam each and every day since it arrived. </p>



<p>Now, according to Alinea Analytics, Embark Studio's third-person extraction shooter has reached a new milestone, with over <strong>12 million copies sold</strong>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">says analyst Rhys Elliot</a>. "<em>So ARC Raiders passed 12M copies sold over the weekend (Alinea estimates)</em>," Elliot wrote in a post on Bluesky.</p>



<p>Not only has it hit yet another sales milestone, but it also set a new record for its daily active users, with over 3.2 million players tuning in yesterday, January 4, to spend their final hours of the winter/holiday break playing some ARC Raiders.</p>







<p>When ARC Raiders launched in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">it was immediately Embark Studios' biggest game</a>, reaching over 200K concurrent players on Steam and who knows how many more on consoles. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">hit 2.5 million copies in its debut week</a>, and barely a week later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">it had surpassed 4 million copies sold</a>. Yes, there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">fair bit of controversy around Embark Studios' use of GenAI</a>, but that never seemed to slow down the game's sales or the fact that it was dominating the conversation around multiplayer games heading into the end of the year and awards season.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most searched video game of the year according to Google</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of Steam's best-selling games by revenue in 2025</a>. Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">continued use and promotion of GenAI</a> still follows the game whenever it comes up in conversation, but it's clearly not a hindrance to it, as at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1m">there are over 240K concurrent players in the game on Steam right now</a>. </p>



<p>It hasn't even dropped below 250K concurrent players since launch, according to SteamDB. Its staying power has been impressive, to say the least, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the defining game of 2026 was this third-person extraction shooter from October 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-is-weird-and-fcked-up-why-one-modder-is-pushing-artistic-flair-against-realism-and-boring-ray-tracing-trends/</link>

			<p>With the improvements made to the <strong>ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</strong> in the past year, playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on PC has become a reality even without an official port. The emulation improvements also paved the way for mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/"><strong>unlock the game's framerate past the 30 FPS cap</strong></a> of the vanilla release and introduced <strong>visual enhancements</strong>.</p>



<p>Among the visual overhauls released for the now-classic PS4 action role-playing game is the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fromsoftserve</a></strong>, a known Souls series modder. Over the past few days, the project became <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong>, undergoing some massive changes fueled by the modder's desire to push <strong>"artistic flair"</strong> against realistic visuals and <strong>"boring" ray tracing trends</strong> that are dominating the industry of late.</p>



<p>The launch of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod, now available from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a></strong>, was announced in a new video shared by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fromsoftserve</strong> on YouTube, which goes over its features. The most notable are the inclusion of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dynamic shadows</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">parallax occlusion mapping</strong> to many surfaces, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">point lights</strong> for elements that emit no light in the vanilla version, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">higher resolution skyboxes,</strong> and more.</p>



<p>Possibly more interesting, however, is the inclusion of <strong>alternate color grading</strong>, which gives <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> a rather peculiar feel. Although quite different from the vanilla grading, <strong>fromsoftserve</strong> believes it suits the game well: <em>"Bloodborne is cosmic and weird and f*cked up, and you can have a very weird looking game,"</em> the modder said in the video.</p>



<p><em>"I'm actually far more interested in an image being interesting than realistic. I think the industry is way too focused on realism, and they’re forgetting that we’re playing games. I think that’s more interesting and has more 'soul' to it than just trying to make it look like a photograph,"</em> fromsoftserve continued in the video to highlight how their approach has a more <strong>artistic flair</strong> that is in stark contrast to the <strong>almost obnoxious search for realism</strong> that is dominating video games as of late.</p>



<p><strong>Ray Tracing</strong> and <strong>Path Tracing</strong> are two other trends that have dominated the video game industry in recent months, and the new approach in the <strong><em>Bloodborne Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod is also a pushback against how ray-traced features are being used.</p>



<p><em>"I love ray tracing and path tracing, but I think the industry is using it currently in a somewhat boring method where they’re just trying to make it look realistic. Making lighting unrealistic is also awesome and fun."</em> Seeing the visuals most of the industry, especially Western developers, is pushing nowadays that is making it difficult to distinguish one game from another, it's difficult not to agree with <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides any further improvements <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod may bring in the next few months, <strong>2026</strong> is still setting out to be an exciting year for <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> fans, even without an official remaster on the horizon. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/">The </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>ShadPS4 team is currently exploring the possibility of enabling the game's online multiplayer features on PC</strong></a>, which will truly transform the emulated version into the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game once they become available.</p>
