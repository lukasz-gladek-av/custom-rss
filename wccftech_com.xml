			<p>Today, Palworld developer Pocketpair&nbsp;<span><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 0.5, which adds</span>&nbsp;major features like cross-play between all platforms, a Photo Mode, and increased storage.</p>
<p><em>▼New Content</em><br>
<em>・Crossplay!</em><br>
<em>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>・Global Palbox</em><br>
<em>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</em></p>
<p><em>・Dimensional Pal Storage</em><br>
<em>⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</em></p>
<p><em>・Cosmetic Armour System!</em><br>
<em>⤷ You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character’s appearance without affecting armour stats!</em></p>
<p><em>・Photo Mode</em><br>
<em>⤷ Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</em></p>
<p><em>・Drafting Table</em><br>
<em>⤷ Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</em></p>
<p>There's also the addition of dedicated servers for the Mac version of Palworld, as well as plenty of balance adjustments and tweaks, bug fixes, and UI improvements. However, the team also said that dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version aren't currently available, though they are working on adding support in the future.</p>
<p>After last year's explosive launch of the game, its success has slowed down, although it still reached the incredible number of 32 million players earlier this year. However, Pocketpair's plans got a big wrench stuck in them when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit for patent infringement. Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley talked at GDC 2025 (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Gamesradar</a>) about how shocking it was for the studio to find this out:</p>
<p><em>This obviously came as a shock to us. I think it came as a shock to a lot of people because it's alleged patent infringement, which is something that no one even considered, and it's something that we're still hashing out basically. It didn't feel good, obviously. We were pretty vocal before Palworld released that we did legal checks before the game released, and they were all cleared - in Japan. So obviously, when the lawsuit was announced, we were all like, 'What?'</em></p>
<p><em>And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts, and they said, 'what's going on,' and that's when we discovered it was patents that they were going for. Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so a pretty depressing day, a lot of people kind of head-down walking home in the rain. It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version. We were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show. Obviously, we had to kind of scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that. But yeah, the short answer is it did not feel good.</em></p>

			<p>Earlier this week, 4A Games <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new blog post</a> on its official website to celebrate the Metro franchise's 15th anniversary. Following up on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier statement from a couple of years back</a>, the development team openly said that the next installment will be much darker because of the Ukraine-Russia War:</p>
<p><em>In 2022, a full-scale Russian invasion changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game. As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make.</em></p>
<p><em>Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war, and often emotional story - and you can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky. Dmitry has always <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-writer-is-on-russias-wanted-list-for-his-anti-war-stance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against the war in Ukraine from the start</a> – a courageous decision for any russian, that has seen him <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-series-author-dmitry-glukhovsky-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced to jail (in absentia)</a> - and we are proud to have him as a friend and co-creator as we tell this next, and never more relevant chapter of Metro together. Rest assured, you are in for quite the ride.</em></p>
<p>The development team also shared an update on their current status. 4A Games is now composed of over 200 members, 150 of whom are still in Kyiv, while the rest are located in the studio's headquarters in Sliema, Malta. Besides Metro, 4A Games is also working on an unannounced intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian developers are inevitably still impacted by the war, and as such, they asked fans to manage expectations when it comes to the reveal of the next Metro: it will be ready when it's ready. Indeed, it's already been over six years since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Exodus</a>, and it sounds like we'll have to wait a while yet before we hear anything concrete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Quimera</a>, a sci-fi first-person shooter game in development at Reburn, formerly 4A Games Ukraine and now completely independent of 4A Games.</p>
