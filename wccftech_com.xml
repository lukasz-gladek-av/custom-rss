			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/">Insider-Gaming</a>, Ubisoft has another live service game in development following its shutdown of XDefiant, which will be gone forever this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">June 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The report claims that this game will be a battle royale and is currently in development under the codename "Scout. "One of Insider-Gaming's sources says that "<em>I think the goal is to capitalize on the player count of Apex dropping and them [Ubisoft higher-ups] thinking there's room in the market for another hero Battle Royale.</em>"</p>
<p>This, of course, isn't Ubisoft's first crack at adding another successful live service title to its portfolio. Rainbow Six is arguably the most significant live service success it has, but that's still a paid title, and not a free-to-play game. Ubisoft's track record is very different in terms of its free-to-play successes.</p>
<p>Out of its current free-to-play offerings, it is easy to imagine that Brawlhalla is the most successful, though Ubisoft's longest-running free-to-play game is the PC-only MMO sandbox Growtopia. Last year's summer release, Battle Core Arena, Rocksmith+, Roller Champions, Trackmania, and Rabbids Coding are also listed on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/games/free">Ubisoft's website</a> as part of its free-to-play lineup. If these games are doing amazingly well for Ubisoft, the company certainly isn't discussing those successes.</p>
<p>Of course, XDefiant used to be on that list, but it was long removed after last year's closing announcements. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hyper-scape/">Hyper Scape</a> is another free-to-play title that, just like XDefiant, didn't last. Right now, it's difficult to see whatever this project Scout ends up becoming, having a different fate than either XDefiant or Hyper Scape.</p>
<p>Battle royales are also not the new, exciting genre they once were in the free-to-play, live service world. Sure, the biggest ones are still very popular. No one is dethroning Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, or PUBG anytime soon. If anything, you could argue that XDefiant's attempt at bringing back an old-school flavor of multiplayer was what had a better shot at breaking through the live service ceiling.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft had let the game run for at least a calendar year and supported it differently, XDefiant might have ended up on the rise after the drop-off from its launch success. If this rumored project makes it to PCs and consoles, we'll see if Ubisoft is willing to give it that chance.</p>
