			<p>The <strong>depth of the combat system</strong> has always been the signature of the <em>Nioh</em> experience, and this is no different in Nioh 3. With the addition of a second fighting style, Ninja Style, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/"><strong>combat is now deeper than ever</strong></a>, featuring so many <strong>unique techniques</strong> that let players play the way they want without penalty.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">there's no real "correct" way to play the game</strong>, it's undeniable that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-dont-waste-skill-points-in-nioh-3-the-essential-samurai-and-ninja-martial-arts/">Martial Arts</a> and Skills are more useful than others</strong>. Among the Skills you can equip, however, there is one called <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The More the Merrier</strong> that can take<strong> your gameplay to the next level</strong>, no matter which fighting style you prefer to use.</p>



<p><strong>Welcome to the Dojo</strong>: here's why<strong> The More the Merrier is a game-changing skill in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The More the Merrier is a Common Skill</strong> costing 4 skill points to equip with a very straightforward function. It allows you to <strong>cancel your actions and allows you to use Summoning Seals, </strong>the special Talismans you get to summon Yokai by equipping any Soul Core to the Yang position in your Onmyo Box.</p>

<p><strong>The More the Merrier can be found</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">relatively soon</strong> during your first playthrough. Its skill manual can be found on a corpse in the <strong>Futama region</strong> in the <strong>Warring States map</strong>, to the north of the Master of the region.</p>

<p>While the function of The More the Merrier skill may not look like much on paper, possibly only speeding up Summoning Seals execution, the skill opens up a lot of incredible combat options in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animation Canceling:</strong> Use Summoning Seals to cancel <strong>any</strong> attack animation in both Samurai and Ninja Style. This makes high-commitment Martial Arts with long recovery times, such as the Odachi’s <em>Thunderbolt</em> or the Cestus’ <em>Limitless</em>, much safer and more viable.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stagger &amp; Pressure:</strong> If an enemy is out of Ki or blocking, the summon will keep them staggered in place. This allows you to safely continue your offense or recover your own Ki for a follow-up.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive Repositioning:</strong> If you misread an enemy’s timing, you can cancel your attack into a summon. Because you can walk in any direction during the summoning animation, you can avoid incoming attacks or recover quickly enough to guard, deflect, or dodge.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Summoning-Seals-loadout-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier skill allows you to take advantage of all sorts of Summoning Seals in creative ways</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Strategic Loadouts:</strong> Since Summoning Seals are limited and replenish at Shrines, you can customize your approach via the Onmyo Box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equip cores in the <strong>Yang position</strong> that grant more total seals to cancel animations more frequently.</li>



<li>Equip the most powerful seals to take advantage of any Soul Core Passive Skill as a last resort to unleash massive combos on enemies with depleted Ki.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Skeleton-Warriors-Summoning-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using Summon Seals with The More the Merrier skill makes it easy to pin down enemies out of Ki for some devastating combos</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Personal Recommendation:</strong> Using the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Scampuss</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skeleton Warrior</strong> cores is highly effective. Their seals deal damage multiple times quickly, keeping the enemy locked in place while you recover Ki to restart your Martial Arts sequence.</p>



<p>This concludes this episode of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Enter the Dojo</strong> guide series, where we dissect the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> mechanics to achieve mastery</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>, which lands in exactly one week, game developer <strong>Game Science</strong> has released six minutes of in-game footage from the upcoming game <strong>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</strong>, a follow-up to the massively successful <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a></strong>. The content doesn't actually include anything that will be in the game itself; it's been crafted just for the celebration. However, it provides an early look at the visual upgrades that we'll see in the upcoming title.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong quickly became a sensation after its launch in August 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to the second spot of Steam's all-time concurrent player chart</a>, where it still sits today. In September, <strong>it had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 18 million units sold</a></strong>, and an expansion was supposed to be underway. However, the studio eventually ditched that plan in favor of fast-tracking a new game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> a few months ago to be titled Black Myth: Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui — 6 Min In-Engine Chinese New Year Special" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQ51gFl7kzk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, in an FAQ published on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, Game Science <strong>clarified that this isn't a direct sequel to Wukong</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design. Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui shares the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore. In terms of genre, it will remain a standard single-player ARPG, following the same business model as before. However, you won't be playing a monkey role this time. That said, we're still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui.</em></p>



<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui is currently in development for PC and consoles. Given that Wukong is still relatively new, <strong>we may have to wait 3 to 4 years before we can play this new title</strong>. Indeed, the FAQ still says the developer hasn't even finished the outline yet. Best get ready for a long wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remedy Announces New CEO, Says CONTROL Resonant’s Reception Was Excellent: “It’s Our Most Ambitious Game, We Want to Make It a Must-Have”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/remedy-new-ceo-control-resonant-most-ambitious-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> announced its new CEO. As you may remember, the previous Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Tero Virtala</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left in late October</a> after nine years in the studio following the <strong>financial disaster</strong> that was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a></strong>. The game, Remedy's first online multiplayer release, utterly failed to deliver a fun, replayable experience, a basic requirement for any successful online multiplayer game.</p>



<p>The newly appointed CEO is <strong>Jean-Charles Gaudechon</strong>. He has over twenty years of experience in the industry, including senior leadership roles at <strong>CCP Games</strong> and <strong>Electronic Arts</strong>, although recently he was a Senior Vice President and General/Group Manager for sports app OneFootball and fantasy sports platform Sleeper.</p>



<p>Gaudechon shared a brief comment to comment the news:</p>



<p><em>I’m excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time. The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry’s future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I’m incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio.</em></p>



<p>This morning, the developer posted its final quarter and full-year financial results, and they're quite positive. In Q4 2025, revenue increased by 46.3% to <strong>€17.0 million</strong> (compared to <strong>€11.7 million</strong> in Q4 2024), driven primarily by <strong>Alan Wake 2</strong> royalties and <strong>Control</strong> game sales. For the full year, revenue increased by 17.5% to <strong>€59.5 million</strong> (up from 2024's <strong>€50.7 million</strong>); operating profit was actually negative at <strong>-14.9 million</strong>, but that's only because of the non-cash impairment caused by the aforementioned FBC: Firebreak. Operating cash flow remained positive at <strong>€4.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Current interim CEO <strong>Markus Mäki</strong> (who will stay in the role until March 1, when Gaudechon officially takes over) clarified that Control sales <strong>reached 1 million in 2025 alone</strong>, most of which came after the announcement of the sequel, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, whose early reception was reportedly excellent:</p>



<p><em>Player and community sentiment has been very positive, indicated by engaged fans and positive wishlist numbers. <strong>Our goal is to make the game a 'must-have day-one purchase' for the fans of&nbsp;Control&nbsp;and the action role-playing genre</strong>. The announcement at The Game Awards in December was a great kickstart to the ambitious global marketing campaign we have planned for&nbsp;CONTROL Resonant.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, CONTROL Resonant is slated to launch this year, though it has no specific launch window yet. </p>
