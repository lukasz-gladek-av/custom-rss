			<p>We know that Neowiz, the parent company of Round 8 Studio, the team behind<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> Lies of P </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture</a>, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/">working on a sequel to its Bloodborne-like hit</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/">has sold over 3 million copies since its launch</a>. But a Lies of P sequel isn't the only project that Neowiz has on the go. In fact, it's not even the only Souls-like game Neowiz has in development.</p>



<p>Per the studio's <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">latest investor presentation</a>, it has a total of five projects set to release on PC and consoles in development at its in-house studios. If you add its mobile games, it has seven total projects on the go from its internal teams.</p>



<p>Of those five projects, one of them is the sequel to Lies of P. Another is a new Souls-like project led by Kay Lee at Neowiz. Another is a new narrative-focused RPG led by Seungho Jin, and rounding out the remaining two is a new life simulator game, and a new survival action title.</p>

<p>The company definitely has a lot on its plate, but after Lies of P, it's difficult not to be completely excited for whatever the studio is cooking up. With Lies of P, the studio proved it could enter a highly competitive and, for many players, oversaturated genre and still find ways to improve and innovate on what came before, even if it didn't hit its mark perfectly.</p>



<p>So, hearing that it'll be trying to do that again with both a sequel to Lies of P and an entirely new Souls-like, and it'll be entering the survival-action game genre, and a new life simulation game, sparks further excitement around how the studio could potentially innovate in those genres. At least, that's the hope.</p>

			<p>For those who have been waiting for a new installment in the Metroid Prime series since August 28, 2007, somehow, now that we're 20 days away (at the time of this writing) from the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the waiting feels even more excruciating. At least in the lead-up to December 4, 2025, Nintendo is putting out new trailers to help tide players over in the last stretch of this long, almost two-decade wait.</p>



<p>The latest overview trailer is a significant look at gameplay, as it goes through several of the game's key systems, showcasing the main game mechanics players will interact with and utilize over the course of Samus' latest adventure.</p>



<p>It also features a solid look at the Galactic Federation soldiers who put out the distress call that Samus responds to at the start of the game, the same call that brings her to the planet Viewros. It seems like these allies will be with her for most of the game, which is definitely a shift from the classic Metroid style of Samus being the lone warrior adventuring out on her own.</p>

<p>Last week, at the one-month mark ahead of the game's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-trailer-ups-the-ante-month-from-release/">a new action-packed trailer </a>showed off some stunning cinematic shots of the game. Now that Nintendo put out another trailer a week later, it feels like that might have been the start of a month-long marketing campaign that'll lead into the game's launch. If that's the case, it'll be great to regularly see more of the game as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Back in April, shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech got to preview the upcoming long-awaited release, with our Nathan Birch writing</a>, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Nathan's feeling that there's a game worth the wait on the way remains true when it arrives on December 4, 2025, on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
