			<p>In the attempt to combat piracy, Nintendo is apparently willing to go as far as bricking Nintendo Switch 2 systems following unauthorized use, according to the updated Nintendo Account Agreement.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-remove-digital-licenses-and-or-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy.1185375/"> Eurogamer</a>, users should have received a new email recently informing them of the updates made to the Nintendo Account Agreement ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Though the wording differs between the European and the United States Agreement, the message is clear. In Europe, digital products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use, and unauthorized use of a Digital Product may result in the product becoming unusable. In the United States, the update states that the user acknowledges that if they fail to comply with the restrictions by Nintendo, the company can not only render the Account Service unusable, but also the device itself, in whole or in part. While restricting access to online services is nothing new, bricking an entire system seems rather extreme, and would create all sorts of legal troubles for Nintendo pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>Nintendo has always been among the video game companies that have fought the hardest against piracy, and they have ramped up their battle ahead of the reveal and the imminent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Last year, the Japanese company went after the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu emulator</a>, which allowed users, among other things, to enjoy Switch games on PC with higher resolutions, higher framerates, and all sorts of mods. The other popular Switch emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, was also taken down last October. With the company now warning users that their system may be bricked, it definitely seems like Nintendo's war on piracy has entered a whole new stage, although it remains to be seen if the company will go to such extreme lengths.</p>

			<p>Hideki Kamiya has found himself working with Capcom once again with the unexpected, but highly anticipated sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a>, but it's not the only game he wants to work with Capcom on.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-remake/">February</a>, in a video on his YouTube channel, in response to a question about remaking the first Devil May Cry game, Kamiya said that he would love to go back and remake Devil May Cry, and even added in that he wants to go back to Viewtiful Joe as well.</p>
<p>Once again, in a video on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HidekiKamiya_Channel"> YouTube channel</a>, when asked the same question, Kamiya gave the same answer.</p>
<p>"<em>As for a Devil May Cry remake, of course I'd love to do that. I usually don't replay my own games after release, and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design. With today's technology and game design approach, of course, I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happen...well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes,I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="“**** remake?” “**** sequel?” &quot;Capcom—Please leave it to me!&quot; Comment Reply Part 11!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOBoqQCcRTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, it's not a surprise that he gave the same answer. It seems like he doesn't mind being asked the question, as it gives him yet another chance to very publicly declare to Capcom and anyone who will listen that he wants to go back to Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>DMC and Viewtiful Joe also aren't the only games he'd want to revisit, as he also previously said he'd love to work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/">Scalebound</a> again, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya is one of the industry's most renowned and respected creators, who is partly responsible for some of gaming's most iconic and beloved series. It would be very interesting to see how he'd approach a remake for Devil May Cry, so hopefully someone at Capcom is paying attention.</p>

			<p>All those who purchase the retail edition of DOOM: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 will need to download the full game to play it, according to a new report.</p>
<p>As reported today by Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPE</a>, users who managed to get their hands on early physical copies of the new entry in the series by id Software confirmed that the game box indicates that an internet connection is required to play the game, which won't even start without one. This is because the disk includes only a small amount of data, around 400 MB, and, as such, the entire game must be downloaded first. Making matters worse, as highlighted by PPE, is the fact that publisher Bethesda hasn't clarified the matter so close to the game's release next week, other than the complete waste of a disc to only include what presumably are only licenses to launch the digital download of the game.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to ramp up the demon-slaying experience of the series to new heights with new mechanics and elevate it past that of its two immediate predecessors. Our review will be up shortly, but in the meantime, you can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview.</a></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 15th worldwide.</p>
