			<p>Elden Ring developer FromSoftware is currently not considering creating a sequel for their highly successful game, but this doesn't mean that the series won't be expanded in the future for certain.</p>
<p>During today's PlayStation Partner Awards, Japanese publication <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameWatch</a> talked with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki about what's next for the development studio after the release of the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. At the moment, the studio is not considering the development of a second entry in the series, but this doesn't mean that a sequel will never be made. For the time being, FromSoftware is working on multiple projects covering different genres, some of them under the direction of Miyazaki-san himself, which will show some different sides of the Japanese development studio.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's latest release is the aforementioned Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which launched earlier this year on PC and consoles. The expansion is every bit as good as the base game, featuring the same mechanics and open-world setting that made The Lands Between so memorable, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>
