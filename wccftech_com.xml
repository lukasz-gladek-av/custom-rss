			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition brings <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-ray-tracing-improvements-comparison/">significant visual improvements</a> to the fifth entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games, but a new mod that was released online a few days back introduces even more stunning improvements that bring the game's realism to new heights.</p>
<p>The ChromatiX Enhanced mod v0.1 public beta, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChromatiXGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, introduces some very welcome visual improvements to the recently released Enhanced Edition, such as increased traffic and pedestrian density, improved lighting and atmosphere for all weather conditions during day and night, increased reflection intensity, brighter nights, enhanced night sky and more. Even in this early version of the mod, the end results are stunning, as showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@INTERGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTER.</a></p>

<p>While many are having issues with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, specifically regarding GTA Online account migration, there's no denying that the improvements Rockstar Games has introduced to the game are an excellent reason to revisit the game and possibly bring new players in. The introduction of ray tracing, DLSS, and FSR support, among other things, also bode well for the inevitable PC port of Grand Theft Auto VI, which will launch sometime after the game debuts on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy version</a> is also still available for purchase to allow those who don't meet the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">system requirements</a> to continue playing the game.</p>

			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim Unreal Engine 5 remaster</a> is now available for download, introducing a lot of new textures to improve the unofficial remaster's visuals.</p>
<p>The new version of the mod, which can be downloaded from the developer Greg Coulthard's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Udab2K5a5X">Discord server</a>, can be seen in action in the video below by Digital Dreams, the modder who provided the new 1000 textures the unofficial remaster now features in its latest iteration. While this unofficial remaster doesn't look as good as modded Skyrim does, it's still interesting to see how some of the original game's low polygon elements fare with the lighting improvements offered by the engine.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Port in Unreal engine 5 HUGE update with 1000 new textures | RTX5090 NextGen graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNIHJJZQPlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remaster or remake is nowhere on the horizon, there's the chance fans of The Elder Scrolls series will soon be able to revisit Oblivion with a remaster/remake that is rumored to be in development by Virtuos, the developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that previously worked on plenty of other high-profile titles. Unofficially revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing with Phil Spencer back in 2023</a>, the remaster/remake is said to feature a lot of improvements over the original, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">combat, stealth, and interface improvements</a>. Unfortunately, the game has yet to be officially revealed, so everything about it is still up in the air, except for the fact that it was originally planned for a Fiscal Year 2022 release.</p>
<p>The latest version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Edition</a> now available on PC and consoles. It introduces some additional content over the Special Edition, which is also available on PC and consoles.</p>
