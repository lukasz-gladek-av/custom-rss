			<p>Destiny 2 is a week away from launching its Star Wars expansion, Renegades, which frankly looks more Star Wars-y than when Destiny did its first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV4qakZgCHY">Star Wars collab in February</a>. Ahead of that launch, it hosted a live stream today where it delved into everything arriving in next week's expansion and showed off a new launch trailer.</p>



<p>Renegades introduces a slew of new weapons, including the Praxic Blade, which is Destiny's version of a lightsaber. Blasters are also an entirely new weapon archetype introduced in Renegades, and feature a heat-based firing system that can overheat instead of having to reload magazines.</p>



<p>The expansion will also introduce the Lawless Frontier, a new activity for players that's meant to be replayable and lets players rise through different Syndicate factions through the new Notoriety system.</p>

<p>The three factions are the Pikers, Tharsis Reformation, and Totality Division. Each has missions you can undertake for them, either by yourself or in groups of three. Different missions include bounty hunts, smuggling runs, sabotage excursions, and a new Invasion mode, which is a feature you opt into that allows a Guardian to spawn into the playing field to try and disrupt your progress.</p>



<p>Bungie also showed off the new dungeon, Equilibrium, which will arrive shortly after Renegades on December 13, 2025. There's also a new video documentary with the team going behind-the-scenes on the making of Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>

<p>Overall, it looks like it'll be an engaging expansion for Destiny 2 players to dig into, but that's not the question really, for Renegades. The question is whether it can bring the players Destiny 2 has lost back to the game.</p>



<p>Just last month, the game reached an <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">all-time low concurrent player count on Steam</a>, and it's not as if those players have returned. The last time it hit over 100K players on Steam was in July, and since early September, it's stayed significantly below 50K.</p>



<p>Of course, Steam concurrent numbers aren't everything and only show a portion of the whole picture. But it's not exactly a good sign for the game, and with<a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/"> everything else that Bungie is dealing with</a>, a poor launch for Renegades could mean even darker times ahead for the beloved studio. </p>
