            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-host-an-open-beta-for-battlefield-6-in-august-dates-revealed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1257429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA and Respawn </a>have just debuted a new gameplay trailer for the latest season for Apex Legends, which is up to its 26th season now since the free-to-play movement-focused battle royale launched in 2019. Season 26: Showdown will arrive on all platforms on August 5, 2025, bringing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-game-updates">some significant changes</a> to the gameplay, including a new permanent mode, Wildcard.</p>



<p>Wildcard is a new mode that really lets players break the tried-and-true systems of Apex Legends. Gone are any cares towards tactical synergies between Legends. You can stack your whole team with the same legend if you want in Wildcard, as you zip and fly around the altered version of Kings Canyon which has been tuned with more ziplines, more launch pads, and every player gets a second chance without having to be revived, so long as you die before the final ring. </p>



<p>Looting has also been simplified and streamlined in this mode to make everything as action-packed as possible. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other changes beyond the addition of Wildcard as a new permanent mode include the introduction of Elite weapons, the first of which is the RE-45. Two Legends, Caustic and Bangalore, are getting significant buffs this season. Amps are being introduced as new passive upgrades players can pick up in ranked and unranked matches. Hop-ups will be locked to weapons now instead of being pick-ups on the ground for players to loot. The reign of the Jumpmaster has ended, as ranked matches will now feature pre-assigned drop zones instead, and the E-District map is getting a switch to a daytime setting.</p>



<p>These are also just the highlights regarding the big changes, as the full details will be unveiled with the full patch notes that will arrive a day before Season 26 goes live, on August 4, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio and NetEase have recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final pre-launch test</a> for Where Winds Meet across both PC and PlayStation 5, and we've taken the opportunity to interview the development team once again (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly three years after the first time</a>) ahead of the release.</p>



<p>As a reminder, Where Winds Meet is an open world action adventure RPG in the Wuxia fiction, set in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, which ran from around 907 to 979. In the game, players forge their own path as a Wuxia martial arts hero, a sword master raised amidst war and conflict while concealing a hidden identity. As they navigate a world on the brink of division and unrest, they will be confronted with difficult choices shaping their character's destiny. </p>



<p>The single player is said to last over 150 hours, but there's also plenty of online multiplayer options, as you'll read in the answers to our wide-ranging questions, which were provided by Lead Designer Chris Lyu.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>You set up various limited-time tests to gather feedback. Based on user feedback, what were the main changes you applied to the game?</strong></p>



<p>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles. We’ve held several test phases, and the feedback we’ve received has been incredibly valuable. Players’ insights have helped us make a number of targeted adjustments throughout development.</p>



<p>For localization, we’ve focused on keeping the philosophical depth and poetic spirit of Wuxia, while rewriting dialogue using language and expressions that are comfortable and relatable for global players. We’re also adding full English voice-overs, so the story can be experienced naturally, in players’ own languages. On the user experience front, we’ve simplified the early tutorial system to address concerns about too many mechanics at once, and we’ve redesigned the UI to make cultural symbols—like ink wash motifs and traditional patterns—clear and easy to recognize.</p>



<p>In terms of content, we’re adding explanations for mythological references (like clarifying the difference between the Chinese "Long" and the Western "dragon"), and we’re enhancing visual storytelling to make the cultural elements intuitive. We’ve kept core features like traditional Chinese clothing and landscape-inspired art, so even players unfamiliar with these elements can get an immediate sense of the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>



<p>For iconic systems such as Acupoint Hitting and Acupuncture, we’ve preserved their original forms, but added clearer feedback so the gameplay feels satisfying and intuitive. We’re also reworking social features to highlight universal themes—honor, brotherhood, and growth through adversity—that everyone can relate to. Of course, all of this is still a work in progress. We’re constantly optimizing and refining the game, and we truly hope that, once it’s released, players around the world will enjoy and immerse themselves in this Eastern martial arts world we’re building.</p>



<p><strong>When we last spoke, you said you were still adjusting the world&nbsp;size. Can you share more details about that now?</strong></p>



<p>The world of "Where Winds Meet" is constantly growing, both in scale and in richness. Right now, we’re working hard to prepare new regions and areas, continually adding diverse landscapes and unique architecture to bring the world to life. For this round of testing, we’re excited to open up the brand-new Kaifeng region. Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</p>



<p>It’s a completely new, distinctive area, and we truly hope players will be as inspired by its scale and majesty as we are. When we designed Qinghe, our vision was to create a sense of “home.” Unlike bustling cities, Qinghe is peaceful and pure—endless fields, simple villages, and vibrant natural ecosystems. The region features sweeping wildlands, secluded settlements, winding rivers, and hidden caves. But it’s also shaped by history: set in the late Tang dynasty, when warlords divided the land and conflict was frequent. You’ll see war-torn ruins, deserted temples, secret underground passages, and yet also encounter villages rich with human warmth and stories. Local martial arts factions hide among the mountains, weaving together a landscape that is both complex and deeply narrative-driven.</p>



<p>Each of these areas feels like a slice of history, filled with dramatic and touching stories waiting to be discovered. Players can follow the main storyline to gradually unravel these mysteries, or explore freely and uncover hidden legends on their own, weaving their own adventures through the city’s alleyways and markets. Looking ahead, we have even more unique and fascinating regions planned for future updates. The world of "Where Winds Meet" will only keep expanding, and we can’t wait for players to experience all the stories and wonders we’re preparing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kaifeng-City-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kaifeng, on the other hand, is one of China’s eight ancient capitals and was once among the largest cities in the world. In our game, we’ve recreated Kaifeng on a massive scale, striving to capture the unique spirit of the era. The city itself is like a vibrant painting, divided into several highly distinctive districts.</em> <em>Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On the Steam page, you mentioned that Where Winds Meet features a 'rich, narrative-driven campaign'. Is there a full-fledged storyline? Can players make choices at&nbsp;specific&nbsp;points?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to offer players a truly open-world experience with a high degree of freedom, while still telling a deep and complete main story. To achieve this, we’ve chosen to let player choices have the greatest impact in side quests, adventure stories, and world exploration, rather than on the main storyline. For example, when players explore the world and encounter various side missions or activities, they can approach challenges in different ways. You might choose to defeat your enemies with martial arts and accomplish your goal through combat. Alternatively, you could become a master persuader, using your words to convince opponents and avoid fighting altogether. Or, you might use your medical skills to heal those you meet—including your enemies—turning potential foes into friends. We want every player to feel that their decisions matter and that there are always multiple paths to any outcome.</p>



<p><strong>In our previous chat, you said the story wouldn't account for much of the whole game. Has that changed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That’s something we’ve thought about a lot. We want to weave the story seamlessly into the world itself, without ever breaking the core open-world experience. For us, the real magic of an open world comes from immersive exploration and meaningful interaction with the environment. So, instead of forcing the story upon players, we’ve carefully hidden narrative fragments throughout the world. Players are encouraged to discover and piece together these story elements on their own, through exploration and curiosity. As you uncover and connect these fragments, a sweeping epic gradually unfolds before you—one that feels truly personal and rewarding because you brought it together yourself.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lively-City-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish. If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Regarding multiplayer, the Steam page says that users can 'open up their world to a group of up to four players'. Does that mean the campaign and story can be fully completed with a group of players?</strong></p>



<p>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. Certain key storylines and moments are meant to be completed solo, allowing for a truly individual adventure. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</p>



<p><strong>Indeed, these other features of Where Winds Meet sound a lot like an MMO: creating a guild, fighting in guild wars, multiplayer dungeons, epic raids, and more. There's also mention of 'thousands of fellow adventurers'. Can you explain how this is going to work? Are there different servers to choose from when transitioning to multiplayer?</strong></p>



<p>Our Multiplayer mode is designed specifically to recreate the authentic, living world of the "Jianghu"—the legendary community of martial artists and wanderers. We want players to truly feel what it’s like to live and interact in this ancient world, meeting and dealing with other real players who are all playing their own unique roles. The core of our Multiplayer design rests on two main pillars:</p>



<ol>
<li>The social enjoyment of real player interactions;</li>



<li>A strong sense of martial arts immersion and role-playing. With these in mind, we’ve created features where players can form and role-play as in-game organizations—like escort agencies or taverns—and work together to build their reputation through cooperative construction and activities. You might play as a traveling doctor and join with other healers to treat sick players, or take on the role of a shadowy vigilante, standing up for others and upholding justice in the world.</li>
</ol>



<p>We also offer flexible ways to access Multiplayer content. For example, if you encounter a particularly challenging boss, you can summon other players to assist you using the in-game support system. There are dedicated options for switching into Multiplayer mode whenever you want to enjoy these unique experiences. At this stage, players don’t need to choose servers—everything is seamlessly integrated to keep the community together. Ultimately, our goal is to create a dynamic, social, and immersive Jianghu where every player can find their own place and story.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Exploration.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback. Future content will continue to enrich both the single-player story experience and the multiplayer social and cooperative aspects, ensuring there’s always something new for different types of players.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As I understand it, Where Winds Meet will be free to play. Can you discuss the monetization system? Can you reassure fans that it won't be a pay-to-win game? Will there be a Battle Pass?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, "Where Winds Meet" is a free-to-play game. We offer options like a battle pass, a monthly subscription, and paid cosmetic items. And yes, there will be absolutely no pay-to-win content. So everyone can enjoy a fair and balanced experience.</p>



<p><strong>What are your post-launch plans? What kind of content can players expect after release, and how often?</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback. Future content will continue to enrich both the single-player story experience and the multiplayer social and cooperative aspects, ensuring there’s always something new for different types of players.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rogue-factor-dives-into-hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-in-new-trailer-and-how-dungeons-were-built-%E2%80%9Clike-old-school-video-game-challenges%E2%80%9D.1257261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-to-release-september-4-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">less than two months</a> from the time of this writing, and in its latest gameplay trailer, developer Rogue Factor showcases more of its dungeon crawling and exploration-focused gameplay, once again touting how the studio's goal with Hell is Us is to remove any of the hand-holding featured in other modern games, and make the experience of playing Hell is Us one where players are truly solving everything on their own.</p>



<p>Rogue Factor's creative and art director on Hell is Us, Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, narrates the video, and boasts that "<em>Hell is Us is not your typical action-adventure game. There's no map, no quest markers, and no hand-holding. Just organic exploration asking you to trust your senses."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We didn't design these dungeons as mere set pieces</em>," Jacques-Belletête continues. "<em>We built them like old-school video game challenges. Tight, crafted, deliberate. Every corner, every obstacle, every encounter, is there for a reason.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>If you missed the days were exploring a dungeon was memorable, this is for you</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hell is Us - Diving into the Dungeons | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuyrcRZ6COQ?start=216&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/30/hell-is-us-new-trailer-and-emotional-insight-from-the-creative-director/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jacques-Belletête goes further into how every dungeon has a theme and emotion that's also tied to the larger story in Hell is Us, and to why the dungeon exists in the first place.</p>



<p>He also talked about how different dungeons will focus on different aspects of gameplay, so players shouldn't expect the same sorts of challenges when entering a new dungeon. </p>



<p>"<em>Some of the dungeons have a lot more puzzles than others, some are more about combat, and some have a lot of environmental changes, like the one in the trailer where you have to play with the water levels and things like that. So they’re all different and tied to lore, which you sometimes need to understand in order to solve a puzzle. One of our themes is ‘history always repeats itself’, and even though you figure out these artefacts from ages ago, you realize that it relates to what’s going on right now. There’s lots to discover and play around with</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, Jacques-Belletête does point out that players should pay attention to a rocky hill in the middle of the dungeon shown at the 1 minute and 45 second mark in the trailer. He tells players to "<em>See what's there</em>" and to "<em>imagine how many things it represents</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever it represents will be something solvable only by playing the game, but even still, it is interesting how so much of Rogue Factor's marketing for Hell is Us has relied on the studio emphasizing that players will need to pay attention to the details in the game's environment and to everything around them. </p>



<p>Even today, claiming that the game presents an "<em>old-school</em>" type of gaming challenge feels like the kind of promise the studio better be prepared to deliver on if they want it to carry any water with players. We'll see if players agree with Rogue Factor when Hell is Us launches on September 4, 2025. And in the weeks after, we'll see if Rogue Factor is being pressured by players to scale back the challenge it has presented in Hell is Us, and to add the kinds of features that it has called out as antithetical to the kind of game it is trying to make.</p>



<p>After all, FromSoftware has famously had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-14/">scale back the difficulty of its bosses</a> after players found them too difficult. It wouldn't be a surprise if players give Rogue Factor the same kind of pressure, though the changes required for Hell is Us would be far more substantial than a few tweaks to a boss fight. We'll see how September goes.</p>
