			<p>Gamers aren't the only ones who are doing everything they can to get their hands on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as soon as possible. According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/game-devs-scramble-to-join-nintendo">The Game Business</a>, game developers are "desperate" to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can count out all the publishers and developers who were able to announce that&nbsp;<span>their&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> on launch or sometime later this year during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation</span>&nbsp;from having this issue. Nintendo has, perhaps expectedly, prioritized the biggest studios and publishers when it comes to who gets a dev kit first.</p>
<p>Those left out of the loop expressed their frustrations to The Game Business, with one studio co-founder expressing why it's so important that studios get their hands on development kits for new consoles as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>"New console audiences are often willing to try new things at the start, so we were desperate to get our hands on dev kits early. Nintendo has finally responded to us, but we still don’t think we’ll get anything for a few months</em>," the studio co-founder said.</p>
<p>That same studio also claimed they could have had a game ready to go with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 this coming June had they heard from Nintendo earlier. The Game Business also reports that most of the studios they spoke to had not received a development kit or any word from Nintendo as to when they would see one coming their way.</p>
<p>The Game Business did add, though, that those teams who have not heard yet are hopeful things will change now that the console's release date and launch lineup have been revealed.</p>
<p>Nintendo might have covered the biggest bases with its first wave of Switch 2 development kits, but alongside the first-party titles Nintendo brings to its platforms, the popularity of indie games on the Nintendo Switch is a key cultural aspect of its player base. And those smaller, independent developers are all the ones who've likely been left out of the loop on development kits.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if any studios speak out in the coming months about how their game could have arrived on Nintendo Switch 2 sooner if only Nintendo had been more willing to share its wealth of development kits.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase Games has just revealed new details about the upcoming Season 2: Hellfire Gala update that will go live next week on April 11, 2025. The new season adds X-Men Emma Frost to the lineup, and Ultron, who spoils the gala Frost is hosting in the Mutant nation of Krakoa.</p>
<p><span>This is also the setting of the new maps that'll be added with Season 2, which, according to a press release, will feature "<em>dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks</em>."</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Season 2: Hellfire Gala Official Trailer | Krakoa Welcomes You April 11! | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/thyG51IdChc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Weekly missions will also be added with Season 2 on top of the already included daily missions, just to give players a little more to do during the three-month-long season.</p>
<p>Speaking of season length, NetEase also revealed that beginning with Season 3, a season in Marvel Rivals will only be two months long, with a new playable character introduced each month.</p>
<p>For Season 2, the first half will introduce Emma Frost as a new Vanguard character, with Ultron, and details about his character type, still to come in the second half of the season. Season 2 will also feature the first time NetEase adjusts or removes certain team-up abilities, which means the game is about to undergo some of its first major changes.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched at the end of 2024, and has so far accomplished what many big publishers have tried and failed to do, which is carving out a slice of the live service pie for itself. NetEase boasts that the game has grown to beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">40 million players</a> since its launch, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Marvel Rivals definitely has an advantage over games like Sony's failed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/">Concord</a>, which was also attempting to establish a new set of characters and a new world for players to enjoy, but as we saw in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers,</a> a big IP backing up your game doesn't mean it'll be a smash-hit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 2 Hellfire Gala | Dev Vision Vol. 05 | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOuv0tO_aLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NetEase even admits in its developer vision presentation that the studio understands the pressure it is under to sustain the success Marvel Rivals has enjoyed so far. These changes coming in Season 2, which are still to be laid bare in the full patch notes still to come, could prove to be the beginning of a turning point for the game, with the next check coming with the arrival of shorter seasons in Season 3. This was a move made specifically to try to keep players engaged and not let the game stay too stale.</p>
