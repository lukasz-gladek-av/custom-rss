			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is practically indestructible, at least according to YouTuber JerryRigEverything, who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9jEYO2oaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> took it upon himself</a> to smash it 50 times with pliers and noticed it still worked. The YouTuber even removed the external plastic layer before attempting this test, which means in reality it's going to be even more resistant to hits of any kind.</p>
<p>Here's the quote from his video:</p>
<p><em>We did remove the plastic screen protector from earlier, and the only way to truly tell if the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is going to scatter into bits if we shatter it is if we shatter it! After 13 hits, the Joy-Cons pop off, and I'm starting to think there isn't any glass and the whole thing is shatterproof plastic. Another 14 very solid hits, and the Switch 2 is shockingly still alive.&nbsp; 15 more and still nothing! This is wild. If watching this doesn't give you confidence&nbsp; in the Switch 2's durability, nothing will. Only after 50 hits from my ridiculously large&nbsp; pliers do we see that indeed there is a thin layer of glass on the surface, and as you can see from the slow motion, Nintendo was right and it does indeed explode into little needle-like shards of glass without that laminate top layer. So I would definitely leave yours intact and in place. Most of the glass is still glued to the LCD, but there are still plenty of free shards of pulverized glass and dust that could embed themselves into little kids' fingers or eyeballs, so I'm glad that Nintendo has a top layer and nobody should take it off. Even though I did get a black screen of death, after a quick reset, Nintendo says it was just kidding about being game over and is ready to keep on playing. Basically invincible. I'm a big fan of the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is a 7.9 inch (20 cm) edge-lit LCD touchscreen with 1080p resolution (279 ppi), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC powered</a> variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and HDR support (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre</a> due to the display's low peak brightness).</p>
<p>The console is literally flying off the shelves, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Nintendo's previous record with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days on the market, roughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch had sold in the same timeframe.
