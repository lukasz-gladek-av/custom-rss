			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most successful games to launch this year. Despite being available on Game Pass from day one, the JRPG developed by Sandfall Interactive has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to sell more than two million units</a>. Considering that its budget was certainly not as large as a regular triple-A game, its success is already guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may even get bigger by adding a new platform like the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with French YouTuber mistermtv</a>, as translated by MP1st, Sandfall Interactive CEO and Game Director Guillaume Broche said that the great sales have changed the perspective, and that the idea was 'interesting'.</p>
<p><em>Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything. So clearly, it’s too early to say, but we’re kind of in a situation where… let’s say there are a lot of opportunities showing up — way too many at once — and we’re figuring out what we’ll go for and what we won’t. But yeah, it’s definitely something that could be interesting.</em></p>
<p>A turn-based JRPG like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could indeed resonate very well with the Nintendo audience, which would get access to a fantastic game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but it's not one of the heaviest titles made with Epic's technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could likely run it. Whether that means Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive actually make the port remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has announced STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy - Enhanced Edition, an updated version of the first three STALKER games it previously released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/">PS4 and Xbox One,</a> now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC next week on <strong>May 20, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new current-gen version of the remasters includes better lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, upscaled textures and environments, advanced shaders, and cutscenes that have been pre-rendered in 4K to add to the storytelling. For console players, though, the catch to all that is you'll see as much of these upgrades as the graphics mode you pick will allow.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, PS5 Pro, or Xbox Series X consoles, players can select between four graphics modes. Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance. The first three are all set at a 4K resolution, with the frame rate caps being the only variable. Quality runs at 4K/30fps, Balanced runs at 4K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 4K/60fps. Ultra Performance sets the resolution down to 2K to reach 120fps.</p>

<p>Xbox Series S players have Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes to choose from, though none of those modes have any of the three STALKER games running at 4K. Quality mode on Series S runs at 2K/30fps, Balanced runs at 2K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 1080p/60fps.</p>
<p>Obviously, PC players don't have to deal with all of that and can more manually adjust graphical settings based on the hardware they have available to them, but there are still a few improvements PC players can look forward to. Such as the games now being optimized for Steam Deck, and support for cloud saves.</p>
<p>Current-gen console players will also be able to plug in a keyboard and mouse, if they want, with KBM support coming in this new version. GSC Game World has also confirmed that the PS5 and Xbox Series versions will have Mod.io support, so they can enjoy some of the modding fun that is usually only accessible on PC.</p>
<p>The best part about this new Enhanced Edition is that anyone who has already purchased any of the remasters in the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will get the corresponding enhanced edition for <strong>free</strong>.</p>
