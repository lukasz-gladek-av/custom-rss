			<p>Ubisoft is not hosting its annual Ubisoft Forward event this year, for the first time since Ubisoft began running its '<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forward-july-e3-style-game-reveals/">Ubisoft Forward' showcases in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech reached out to Ubisoft to confirm the initial report, but the confirmation first came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z">Game File founder and reporter Stephen Totilo</a>, who was told by a Ubisoft representative that the company is <em>"always eager to connect with our players and showcase our</em> <em>games</em>" and that it is "<em>continuing to explore opportunities to share updates, and we look forward to providing more information at a later date</em>."</p>
<p>Wccftech was also told, as was Totilo, that we'll see Ubisoft participating in other aspects of Summer Game Fest, including the IGN Live event this weekend between June 7 and 8 and the PC Gaming Show on June 8. We'll also see Ubisoft later this summer at Gamescom 2025.</p>

<p lang="en">Ubisoft Forward, which has been a digital and in-person showcase for the company's games just about every June, isn't happening this year.A company rep tells me Ubisoft will participate in IGN Live (June 7-8) and PC Gaming Show (June 8) and will also be at GamesCom</p>
<p>â€” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z?ref_src=embed">2025-06-03T23:03:50.202Z</a></p></blockquote>


<p>When Wccftech reached out to confirm Totilo's report, we also asked for any further clarification as to why the decision was made to skip 2025, and if the event will return next year. We simply received the same statement that was initially reported, with no further clarification.</p>
<p>Though, as Totilo points out, it's not the biggest surprise that Ubisoft is taking a year off. To say that Ubisoft is going through a big internal shift at the moment would be an understatement, as it is figuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">out a new structure post its deal with Tencent</a>, which could very well lead to <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the company's biggest series are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">nowhere to be seen</a>, seemingly in a state of<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> development limbo</a>, and that's before getting into other issues the company is currently facing, with former executives from the company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">currently on trial for alleged sexual harassment</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">has done incredibly well</a>, sure, but it's the lone big win Ubisoft has had to cut its streak of losses from 2024. And just yesterday, the company's failed multiplayer shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-now-taken-offline-forever/">XDefiant, was officially taken offline forever</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what the company has for the events it is confirmed to participate in this weekend, but with everything it has going on, it's almost no wonder why Yves Guillemot didn't want to stand on a stage to celebrate the company's short and long-term future.</p>
