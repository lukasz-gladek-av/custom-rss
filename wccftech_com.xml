			<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements were <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1849828271372026120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the type of system configuration required to play the game at different resolutions, 30 and 60 frames per second, and with different graphics presets.</p>
<p>To run the game at 720p resolution at 30 frames per second at the Very Low preset, players require an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 1300x CPU, GTX 1650 4 GB or AMD Radeaon RX 5500 XT4 4GB an 16 GB of RAM. On the other hand, to enjoy the game at its best at the Very High preset, 4K resolution, and 60 frames per second, players will need an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU, RTX 4080 or Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Judging from the infographic above, the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements are essentially the same as those of Forbidden West, so those who had no trouble running the second entry in the series released earlier this year on PC shouldn't have much trouble running the remaster of the first, which comes with some impressive enhancements as detailed <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>
