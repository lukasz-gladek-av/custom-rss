			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>
