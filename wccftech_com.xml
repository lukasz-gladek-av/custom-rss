			<p>The newly revealed Nintendo Switch 2 console could end up becoming one of the most popular gaming systems of all time, as suppliers are reportedly ready to ship a huge amount of units in the first year of availability.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, unspecified analysts said that Nintendo suppliers are ready to ship 20 million units in the console's first year of availability, a much bigger number of units compared to the first year of other popular systems like the original Switch, and the PlayStation 5, although production of the current generation system by Sony was impacted for quite some time by shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic. With this many units, at the very least, there shouldn't be too much trouble finding the console in stores, which has apparently been one of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> Nintendo's concerns</a> for a long time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally officially been revealed today with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/">a trailer</a> that focused on the hardware and the differences with the current system. Besides showing off the system, the trailer also provided a quick look at what will likely be the next entry in the Mario Kart series and confirmed that the new system will have full backward compatibility with the current consoles, as it will run both physical and digital Switch games. A better look at the system will come in April with a dedicated Nintendo Direct, while a select few will be able to get some hands-on time with the Nintendo Switch 2 thanks to special experiences that will be held across the world.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide in 2025.</p>
