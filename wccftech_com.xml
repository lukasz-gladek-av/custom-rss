			<p>Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two Interactive, is once again doing his best to project confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed from its current release date.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC5BVh0IaOg&amp;t=269s">CNBC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), on the subject of Grand Theft Auto VI hitting its currently stated release date, Zelnick said, "<em>My level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.</em> <em>Rockstar does have a lot of other things going on, but this is of course the primary focus</em>."</p>

<p>Prior to Grand Theft Auto VI getting delayed out of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar announcing its May 26, 2026 release date</a>, Zelnick did his best on multiple occasions to publicly express confidence in Rockstar hitting its <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. To be fair, there was no specific release date at the time, just a month and a year, meaning that Rockstar could be a little more loose with when exactly GTA VI would arrive. And this game is such a major release that you'd think Rockstar and Take-Two wouldn't call their shot so specifically if they weren't confident they would make it.</p>



<p>But the number of times Zelnick seemed to have a "<em>very high"</em> level of conviction that GTA VI wouldn't miss its 2025 window does make comments like this that much more difficult to believe. </p>



<p>Sure, it's been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and while it was being worked on in some capacity in that time, Rockstar has been focusing on <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/">GTA VI's development "<em>in earnest</em>" since 2020</a>. Zelnick also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/">previously called the delay to 2026 "<em>important</em>" </a>to ensure that Rockstar had the chance to "<em>seek perfection</em>" with this release.</p>



<p>But even Zelnick cushioned his comments to CNBC to say that he and Take-Two are trying not to "<em>pump expectations</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game</em>," said Zelnick.</p>



<p>We'll see how things look in six to seven months from now, when we're on the doorstep to its current May 26, 2026, release date. Hopefully by that time we'll have a clear idea if Zelnick was right to express confidence here. </p>
