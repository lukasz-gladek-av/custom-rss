			<p>During NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote, <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-showcases-latest-advancements-in-game-development-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inworld AI</a> announced a partnership with the maker of GeForce graphics cards and with Logitech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/logitech-enters-streaming-fight-with-89m-purchase-of-streamlabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamlabs</a> division to unveil what they're calling the world's first Intelligent Streaming Assistant.</p>
<p>The collaboration mixes Streamlabs' live streaming expertise, NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACE</a> technology and AI vision models, and Inworld AI's perception and cognition capabilities. Using multimodal AI, Inworld powers the brain of the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, transforming it into an interactive co-host, expert producer, and technical assistant.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed overview of how everything works under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Interactive Co-Host:</strong> Leveraging NVIDIA’s computer vision capabilities to detect events in real time with Inworld’s ability to drive real-time agent behavior based on game state and contextual understanding of games, the Intelligent Streaming Assistant can offer contextually relevant commentary at the creator’s request. This awareness enables the assistant to do things like highlight a well-timed build, provide commentary during a dramatic Victory Royale, or even shout out at audience members for sending tips.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stream Producer:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant can trigger audio and visual effects to enhance high-impact gameplay or clip the best highlights for replay. Inworld processes multimodal inputs from the creator, chat, and game to execute these Producer Actions through the Streamlabs API, giving the creator full control over how their stream unfolds.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Technical Assistant:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant also helps with setting up Streamlabs Desktop and troubleshooting. Inworld processes the input from the creator to execute scene transitions or animations through the Streamlabs API, helping ensure the stream runs smoothly.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Creators will be able to select from assistant personalities that pair well with the tone of their stream, whether they are looking for subtle behind-the-scenes support or a lively co-host. Check out a short demo video below.</p>

<p>Kylan Gibbs, CEO of Inworld AI, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The pace of innovation in generative AI is nothing short of extraordinary, propelling us beyond first-generation applications into a new era of sophisticated agentic behavior. Our collaboration with Streamlabs and NVIDIA exemplifies how Inworld's AI agents enable real-time, context-aware interactions. More importantly, it demonstrates the real-world potential of AI to augment games and entertainment—empowering creators to deepen engagement and delight their audiences.</em></p>
<p>Ashray Urs, Head of Streamlabs, added:</p>
<p><em>We hope that with this groundbreaking technology, creators can now embrace AI in a way that is authentic to their brand and enables them to push the boundaries of innovation. The first intelligent streaming assistant represents another leap forward for the medium, giving creators the power to harness this technology to make streaming easier and more captivating, all while maintaining the level of authenticity they need to nurture and grow their community.</em></p>
<p>The Intelligent Streaming Assistant will be available via the Streamlabs App Store later in 2025.</p>
