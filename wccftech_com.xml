			<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake is reportedly launching as early as mid-January 2026 on PC and consoles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> podcast, well-known leaker Tom Henderson, who has revealed numerous accurate details about Ubisoft's projects before official announcements in the past, confirmed that the remake will be released in mid-January.</p>



<p>As for when the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will be shown again, Tom Henderson couldn't confirm. What he knows is that Ubisoft is internally planning to market it for only one month before the release date, so a new showing at next week's The Game Awards show would make the most sense to get as many eyes as possible on the game. Still, there's no real indication this may happen, so the marketing for the game may also involve a simple trailer drop on YouTube in the next few days.</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has been in the works for quite some time. Confirmed initially back in September 2020, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">the game was slated for an early 2021</a> release which never came to pass, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">delayed indefinitely in February 2021</a>. The reason for the indefinite delay was only provided in 2022, when it was confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">development had been rebooted, with the reins passing to Ubisoft Montreal, the developer of the original game</a>.</p>



<p>Even with the original developer back at the helm, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake development, it took some time to learn that development was proceeding smoothly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">An important development milestone was passed in November 2023</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/">an early 2026 release window was finally confirmed this May.</a></p>



<p>If the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake indeed launches next month, it would be the third entry in the series to release in the span of two years after a very long hiatus. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown brought the series back to its 2D origins in January 2024,</a> while <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia expanded the series' 2D gameplay with roguelike elements</a> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">this August</a>.</p>
