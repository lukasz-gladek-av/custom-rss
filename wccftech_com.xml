			<p>Russia is off the board for Roblox, as the country's media regulatory body, the Roskomnadzor, blocks the game from Russian citizens. Included in its reasons for the block is the safety of children with regard to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">multiple reports</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">abuse and child predators</a> on the platform and the Roskomnadzor's concern that children will be exposed to what it defines as "<em>inappropriate content</em>," including in-game LGBTQ+ content.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963">local Russian publication TASS</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41q11gy58o">BBC News</a>, the Roskomnadzor cited the platform being "<em>rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children</em>."</p>



<p>In response, a Roblox spokesperson said, "<em>We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform</em>."</p>



<p>Roblox may be one of the more high-profile titles to be blocked by the Roskomnadzor, but it is hardly the first. Just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">a solitaire game was banned on Steam in Russia for its LGBTQ+ content</a>. And while much of the world would not agree with Russia's assessment that LGBTQ+ content is negative for the moral development of children, the overwhelming amount of reports and litigation that Roblox has faced over its lacklustre protections for children, which have resulted in predators abusing and assaulting kids, is not an unfair reason to block the popular game.</p>



<p>Roblox has been trying to make the platform a safer place for kids, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/"> just last month introduced age verification via facial recognition to unlock the ability to use in-game chat features</a>. Despite its issues and ongoing litigation, Robox continues to grow, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">recently set a peak concurrent users record that surpassed Steam's overall concurrent record</a>.</p>

			<p>REPLACED, the 2.5D pixel-art-based cyberpunk platformer that was first showcased at E3 2021 and was arguably one of the most exciting prospective Xbox exclusives at the time of its reveal, finally has a release date, and will arrive on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, and on Xbox Series X/S this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement follows developer Sad Cat Studios' announcement in August 2025 that it could confirm, "<em>with confidence</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/">that REPLACED would be out by Spring 2026</a>. That confidence has clearly not waned, and we now have a release date for a game that, by the looks of its release date trailer, hasn't lost any of the special quality players saw in that 2021 reveal.</p>



<p>The new trailer is the best look at the game we've gotten in the years since its initial announcement, and backed by an original song from the game's soundtrack titled "<em>Dusk</em>," it appears to be firing on all cylinders ahead of its March release.</p>

<p>As to why Sad Cat Studios took as long as it did to get to this point, it wasn't because Sad Cat Studios was toiling away, working on the game non-stop and burning time. Development was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, pushing it to the point we're at now, where a game that would have otherwise come out somewhere between 2021 and 2023 is out in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play REPLACED and it's no secret that it's taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologize for that,</em>" said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release back in August when the studio announced the release window. "<em>We've always tried to do what's right for the project,</em> <em>which in turn means delivering to you a truly special experience."</em></p>



<p>We'll see what Sad Cat Studios has for players when REPLACED launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S on March 12, 2026.</p>
