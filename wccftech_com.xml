			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios announced that the Fallout Day 2025 broadcast would be streamed live on October 23, 2025, at 1 PM Eastern Time via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>, and Steam. Bethesda said fans can tune in to learn new information and announcements about 'existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events'. October 23 is no random date: it's when the two-hour-long nuclear exchange between the United States and China led to the post-nuclear setting of Fallout.</p>



<p>When Bethesda mentions existing games, the mind immediately goes to Fallout 76, since it's the only franchise game that gets regular updates. However, Fallout 76 just got a major reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the deep dive of the Burning Springs update</a>. In December, Bethesda Game Studios will release a major land expansion, bringing Fallout players to Ohio for the first time in the franchise. The new region draws heavily on Fallout 3 and New Vegas aesthetics, aiming to recapture the feel of a harsh, depraved wasteland seen in those games. </p>



<p>Then there's the introduction of The Ghoul, the character played by Walton Goggins in the TV show, who is coming to the game and will introduce the bounty hunting feature with tiered contracts (grunt and head hunts). Bethesda hopes this will create ongoing, repeatable content that encourages both solo and cooperative play. The randomization of contract locations and the public event nature of head hunts foster community interaction and provide a robust source of rewards, addressing players’ desires for challenging but rewarding activities. </p>



<p>There might be some additional tidbits about the Burning Springs update to be shared in the upcoming Fallout Day broadcast, but by and large, the reveal for Fallout 76 already happened. As such, franchise fans are already hoping to hear something about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-3-oblivion-remasters-xbox-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster</a>, as that might fall under 'existing Fallout games'. Of course, it's always possible that Bethesda has just found a new platform to launch Fallout 4 on, like the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has been significantly improved on Nintendo Switch 2 by a new patch that went live this week.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64">a new report shared on X by SuperMetalDave64</a>, the 1.4 update introduces significant visual improvements, including improved texture quality, LOD draw distance, and lighting and fog with less light bleed. Even at a glance, these visual improvements are easily spottable and bring the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game closer to the other console versions of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The newest update 1.4 to Cronos: The New Dawn on Switch 2 is the biggest yet for graphical improvements:</p><p>-Textures Noticeably Improved<br>-LOD Draw Distance Improved<br>-Lighting/Fog Improved (less light bleed)<br>-Item Pick Up Highlight Effect Fixed <br>-Time Reversal Effect Fixed <a href="https://t.co/yxBq2SSrEG">pic.twitter.com/yxBq2SSrEG</a></p></div>— SuperMetalDave64 (@SMetaldave64) <a href="https://twitter.com/SMetaldave64/status/1975335969537860057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>SuperMetalDave64 also shared a quick comparison between the 1.3 version, the new 1.4 version and the max settings PC version of Cronos: The New Dawn. This side-by-side comparison clearly highlights the improvements which make the Switch 2 version a more palatable choice than at launch.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn leverages a lot on its visuals to create the haunting experience that defines the game, so the improvements introduced in the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game effectively improve the whole game on the system. You can learn more about how the game's atmosphere makes for one of Bloober Team's best games by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">my review</a>.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-detailed-pc-specs-from-minimum-to-ultra/">out in just two days from the time of this writing</a>, and when it launches, it'll do so with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen technology, alongside Little Nightmares III, which also launches on October 10, and with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-nvidia-reflex/">NVIDIA in a new blog post about the latest batch of DLSS 4 games</a>, when pushing max settings on Battlefield 6, at 4K, and while using an RTX 50 Series card, you get a "<em>3.8X</em>" boost in frame rates on average. "<em>GeForce RTX 5090 performance rockets to over 470 FPS, the GeForce RTX 5080 exceeds 330 FPS, the GeForce 5070Ti is in touching distance of 300 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 230 FPS.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Little Nightmares III doesn't exactly require the kind of high frame rates you'd want from a shooter like Battlefield 6, it'll still be nice to have a smooth experience while exploring the horrors that Supermassive Games has in store.</p>



<p>Beyond Little Nightmares III and Battlefield 6, NVIDIA also confirmed that when Crimson Desert launches next March, it'll do so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support, with more details to follow as to what that'll look like closer to the game's launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the mountain biking game Mavrix by Matt Jones has also been confirmed to be adding support for DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. </p>



<p>Last month, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Annata <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-ananta-jurassic-world-evolution-3/">were added to the list of games</a> that support DLSS 4.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 update launching on all platforms will introduce new content to the RPG developed by Sandfall Interactive released in April 2025.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/506216119584948426?l=english">a new message shared by the studio on Steam</a>, celebrating the game selling 5 million copies, and the original soundtrack composed by Lorien Testard hitting 333 million track streams since its release. This new update, whose release date has yet to be confirmed, will include new content and features according to the developer. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new playable location environment with new enemy encounters and surprises to find.</li>



<li>New challenging late-game boss battles</li>



<li>New costumes for each party member that will also provide new customization options</li>



<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, which will bring the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
</ul>



<p>New content coming to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is excellent news, as the new challenges will only improve one of the best JRPGs released in the current generation, and, in my opinion, a serious contender for this year's Game of the Year award. You can learn more about why I believe so by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">checking out my</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
