			<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake is reportedly launching as early as mid-January 2026 on PC and consoles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> podcast, well-known leaker Tom Henderson, who has revealed numerous accurate details about Ubisoft's projects before official announcements in the past, confirmed that the remake will be released in mid-January.</p>



<p>As for when the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will be shown again, Tom Henderson couldn't confirm. What he knows is that Ubisoft is internally planning to market it for only one month before the release date, so a new showing at next week's The Game Awards show would make the most sense to get as many eyes as possible on the game. Still, there's no real indication this may happen, so the marketing for the game may also involve a simple trailer drop on YouTube in the next few days.</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has been in the works for quite some time. Confirmed initially back in September 2020, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">the game was slated for an early 2021</a> release which never came to pass, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">delayed indefinitely in February 2021</a>. The reason for the indefinite delay was only provided in 2022, when it was confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">development had been rebooted, with the reins passing to Ubisoft Montreal, the developer of the original game</a>.</p>



<p>Even with the original developer back at the helm, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake development, it took some time to learn that development was proceeding smoothly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">An important development milestone was passed in November 2023</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/">an early 2026 release window was finally confirmed this May.</a></p>



<p>If the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake indeed launches next month, it would be the third entry in the series to release in the span of two years after a very long hiatus. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown brought the series back to its 2D origins in January 2024,</a> while <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia expanded the series' 2D gameplay with roguelike elements</a> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">this August</a>.</p>

			<p>The future of the Metal Gear Solid series is uncertain at this time, but it may include new entries in the series as well as other remakes, according to producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Japanese publication Real Sound</a>, Okamura-san was asked about what could be next for the series, which was brought back this year with the release of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The series producer wants to continue working on the series, but how the franchise's future will be shaped is still uncertain, and may involve both remakes and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new works".</em></p>



<p>The Metal Gear series is akin to the history of video games, spanning from pixel art games to cinematic experiences, so the remake approach for each title would be different, Okamura-san explained. As such, the remake method used to remake Snake Eater wouldn't work for every remake, which would need to be considered separately. This suggests that Konami may not pursue a 3D remake of the original 8-bit Metal Gear games, as the producer indicated the Delta method isn't universally applicable.</p>



<p>Still, with almost every main entry in the series to date being playable on current gaming systems<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/"> thanks to either backward compatibility or remasters</a>, there's not a pressing need to remake any of them, except the fourth entry in the series, Guns of the Patriots, which is still only available on PlayStation 3. Speaking about this game, Okamura-san noted that the notorious difficulty of developing for the PS3 resulted in the creation of special, highly complex code that would pose unique challenges for a modernization effort.</p>



<p>No matter if with a remake or remaster, a modern version of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots would be rather welcome. Following the release of the Master Collection Vol 1, there have been indications that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">the fourth entry in the series would be included in the hypothetical Master Collection Vol 2</a>, so the time when players will be able to experience the end of Solid Snake's story on modern hardware may not be too far in the future. Hopefully, Okamura-san and his team will face these development challenges head-on to provide fans of the series quick access to a game that has been too long stuck on original hardware.</p>
