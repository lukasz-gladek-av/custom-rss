			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was undeniably the defining game of 2025. For all the industry discussion it drove, to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">dominating performance at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, it was the one game that came out of nowhere and took over for the year. Not only did it win Game of the Year at The Game Awards, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">the winner at the <strong>Golden Joysticks</strong></a>, and the choice of several media outlets across the globe as they all picked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as well. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">ResetEra user Angie keeps an amazingly long and detailed thread of games during each awards season</a>, with several stats for anyone interested to dig through. Now that we're into 2026, the numbers for 2025's awards season have mostly been tallied, with <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting 291 Game of the Year wins in 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>That sets it just above Baldur's Gate 3, which was awarded 288 Game of the Year wins when it arrived in 2023. Ahead of it by a fairly large margin is The Last of Us Part II at 326, and ahead of everything by a country mile is Elden Ring with <strong>435 Game of the Year wins in 2022.</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the list, it'll be quite the event when/if something ever beats The Last of Us Part II and Elden Ring, since The Last of Us Part II is a solid 35 wins ahead of Clair Obscur, and Elden Ring is <strong>109 wins</strong> ahead of The Last of Us Part II. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of the 21 games with over 100 Game of the Year Wins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Elden Ring (FromSoftware) - 435</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part II (Naughty Dog) - 326</li>



<li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) - 291</strong></li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III (Larian Studios) - 288</li>



<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt Red) - 281</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo EPD) - 264</li>



<li>God of War (2018) (Santa Monica Studio) - 263</li>



<li>The Last of Us (Naughty Dog) - 257</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda) - 229</li>



<li>Astro Bot (Team Asobi) - 196</li>



<li>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (Naughty Dog) - 190</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Games) - 178</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games) - 163</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition (BioWare) - 139</li>



<li>Death Stranding (Kojima Productions) - 118</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarök (Santa Monica Studio) - 118</li>



<li>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (Naughty Dog) - 115</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo EPD) - 114</li>



<li>Overwatch (Blizzard Entertainment) - 114</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar Games) - 111</li>



<li>Mass Effect 2 (BioWare) -102</li>
</ol>



<p>This may not be the most 'official' list in the view of some people, but it is an interesting one to look at as a way to 'take the temperature' of what games media and game critics value and look toward as their picks for what is the best of the best each year. The top five, for example, are all single-player, story-driven experiences, with four out of five being fantasy-based RPGs. The only game in the top ten that's not fantasy-based, isn't largely narrative-driven, doesn't have RPG mechanics, and isn't an open-world game is 2024's Astro Bot with 196 wins.</p>



<p>In the top 21 listed, the only multiplayer-focused game is Overwatch in 19th place. Rockstar, Naughty Dog, BioWare, Santa Monica Studios, and Nintendo all have multiple titles on the list, with Naughty Dog leading the pack at four.</p>



<p>Multiplayer games may be the games people are going to daily, and the ones that sell the most each year, but it's clear that they are not the ones critics are looking to as the best-of-the-best each year.</p>



<p>As for Wccftech's pick of 2025's best, Clair Obscur was indeed <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our top ten Best Games for 2025</a>. It also made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Best Role-Playing games</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak for a solid hour with <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended Co-Creative Director and Lead Programmer Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, and he had a lot to reveal, including the studio's ongoing attempts to bring the game to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the previous slice of the gargantuan interview</a>, we focused on Stieglitz's confirmation that Unreal Engine 5.7 represents a massive performance boost in their testing. It is so massive, in fact, that the Nintendo Switch 2 port is only possible after the studio completes the engine upgrade to UE 5.7. The twist, however, is that even that alone won't be enough, which led Stieglitz to inform us that they are exploring ways to implement Frame Generation on the platform, utilizing either NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR 3.1. </p>



<p><em>Unreal Engine 5.7's performance boost is so extreme, in fact, that one of the reasons we had been working on it is that, on the side, we'd been exploring doing a Nintendo Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We actually have that running internally, and we found that <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 port was only doable with Unreal Engine 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant a performance improvement. So, we're really excited to get that one out.</em></p>



<p><em>I should note that the good news is <strong>the 5.7 improvements, they're not PC specific</strong>. Most of them apply to both consoles as well. So, we're really looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the <strong>Xbox</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> player base who, to this point, aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is, by our reckoning, <strong>a solid, unbreakable 60FPS is where we really want to be on those consoles</strong>. So, PlayStation and Xbox users have something to look forward to with that upgrade and not just PC users, but with Nintendo Switch 2 in particular... </em></p>



<p><em>We actually do have a working build of it and frankly, <strong>it was about half off where it needed to be performance-wise</strong>. Memory was actually very good, or I would say good enough. <strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 has, in effect, more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S</strong>, the so-called Lockhart platform, does. And so, since we already had basically scaled ARK: Survival Ascended for Series S, we found that we were in a better memory state than on that console and therefore weren't in a case of running out of memory on the Nintendo Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics on the Switch 2 than we do on the Series S. But the issue was the GPU primarily being weaker. We were able to use all the primary rendering features. Working on it, we wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that</strong>. We needed the game to look approximately like the Series X version or the PlayStation 5 version, even if it would be at a lower resolution. So, the issue was not core rendering features. We would have to do <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>Nanite</strong>, and <strong>Virtual Shadow Maps</strong>. All three of those things are important to us on Switch 2. I think we may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is kind of a slightly older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a lower resolution device like the Nintendo Switch 2, which for us would be a 1080p handheld 1440p docked resolution as opposed to 4K in either case. So Cascade shadows are good enough, but Lumen and Nanite, Nanite in particular with the large open world foliage scenes, were just hammering it very badly, and we were basically about half off of where we needed to be on the Nintendo Switch 2. </em></p>



<p><em>What does the Switch 2 version need? I mean, let's be clear, <strong>it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience</strong>. It's just not in the cards for Switch 2 with ARK: Survival Ascended. But the bottom line is, <strong>it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half off where we needed to be to get to that. That was prior to the Unreal Engine 5.7 test. We have found gains of about <strong>33 to 40% overall frame rate</strong>. It was completely GPU-bound, and it gains us about 33 to 40% off the GPU in those scenes. That was very, very good</em>, <em>but <strong>still not<br>where we need to be</strong> to get to a 30 FPS perceived frame rate solidly. </em></p>



<p><em>So, even the Unreal Engine 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. There's one last thing we're exploring right now. It's still an open question, which is why I can't say precisely when the game would come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, because it really requires getting to that solid core 30 FPS frame rate. Right now, just to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on UE 5.7. So, how do we get to a 30-plus FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with Frame Generation</strong>, but the truth is, I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. It's not yet supported by either <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, who makes the Switch 2 GPU, or <strong>AMD</strong>. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. So, we would have to port it ourselves, or work with them to do so. We've been just starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation is possible on the Switch 2, or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable. We don't know the answer. One of those I have to presume will be doable, hopefully. I mean, it's technology that should in theory work, especially AMD's, which is not hardware specific. That should be doable, but we would have to explore more of the ports. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of ARK: Survival Ascended. </em></p>



<p><em>Let me be frank, <strong>I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation</strong>. But if I can get to 20 to 25 without frame interpolation, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough. I don't think it'll look too smeary or too laggy if we're close to 30 without it. The reality is we're getting there. It's looking good and it's progressing, so I hope it's going to happen and be released this year and is impressive. </em></p>



<p>I then asked if the game would utilize NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, which the Nintendo Switch 2 definitely supports (although not every game takes advantage of it). Stieglitz said yes, while also adding that <strong>NVIDIA has been 'vague' about whether the hybrid console can support DLSS Frame Generation</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, DLSS works fine and is quite impressive. It helps quite a bit with the up-resing and image sharpening and clarity, but they separate the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the Frame Generation algorithm. What we've heard from NVIDIA is that they don't currently support Frame Generation on the Switch 2, but they've been a little vague about whether it can be supported. So, <strong>we have to poke them a little harder and try and get an answer on that in the new year</strong>.</em></p>



<p>To our knowledge, the platform does not support it; however, it's interesting to hear that Studio Wildcard did not receive a conclusive 'no' from NVIDIA. Needless to say, it could be a big deal for future game releases if the Nintendo Switch 2 supported some form of Frame Generation. We'll remain vigilant on the subject.</p>



<p>Lastly for the Nintendo Switch 2 portion of our ARK: Survival Ascended interview, Stieglitz confirmed that if it does come out on the console, it will join the same community of PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, unlike the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-evolved-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Nintendo Switch port of ARK: Survival Evolved</a>.</p>



<p><em>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2 (fingers crossed, and we are working on it), <strong>it would be a cross-platform, cross-multiplayer version of the game</strong>. It would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version of the game. The original Switch 1 version of ARK: Survival Evolved was unfortunately a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain, and I also think led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been by not connecting with the wider player base and not getting all the same content. We wouldn't be making that mistake again for the new version if it comes to pass.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for the rest of our chat with Jeremy Stieglitz on ARK: Survival Ascended's recently launched premium DLC, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a></strong>, and what's next for the popular survival game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store Saved You Over $550 With Its 2025 Holiday Daily Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/</link>
            <guid>1396084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Game Store's annual holiday daily giveaways have come to an end, and if you redeemed each of the games that were made free for 24 hours between December 18 and January 1 (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">Hogwarts Legacy on December 11</a>), you just saved over $550 by not having to buy those games.</p>



<p>The giveaway ended with Epic giving away two games on January 1, 2026, instead of one: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/"><strong>Wildgate</strong>, the PvP shooter from Dreamhaven that was released in 2025</a>, and <strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong>. With those two games, and the fact that the Trine Collection was technically four games in one single day, the Epic Games Store gave away <strong>20 games this past holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Totalling up the cost of the games at their non-discounted prices, you would have paid $567 USD to buy all of those games, including buying the four Trine games in a bundle as the Trine Collection. If you bought the Trine games individually, then the total goes up to $604.</p>



<p>That is not an insignificant amount of money saved if you're the kind of person who would have bought all of the games given away, which range in price and genre, from more narrative-driven and some smaller experiences that cost anywhere between $13-$30, to popular indies and even some triple-A titles costing between $40-$60. </p>



<p>Wildgate and Total War: Three Kingdoms will remain free for players to grab on the Epic Games Store until January 8, 2026, at which point the regular pace of one free game a week resumes, starting with Bloons TD 6.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games that were given away by Epic, starting on December 11, and then starting daily from December 18 through to January 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22)</li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>



<li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Dec. 25)</li>



<li>We Were Here Together (Dec. 26)</li>



<li>Cassette Beasts (Dec. 27)</li>



<li>SKALD Against the Black Priory (Dec. 28)</li>



<li>Viewfinder (Dec. 29)</li>



<li>Trine Collection (Dec. 30)</li>



<li>Chivalry 2 (Dec. 31)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Jan. 1)</li>



<li>Total War: Three Kingdoms (Jan. 1)</li>
</ul>



<p>It's all together, not a bad list of games. It's not the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1plsdrt/epic_games_christmas_free_game_giveaways_leaked/">fake list that appeared on Reddit</a> that seemed to gain traction based on how people would've genuinely loved it to be real. But it's not a terrible bunch of 20 games.</p>



<p>That said, what is unfortunate is that several of the titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">including The Callisto Protocol</a> and Chivalry 2, were games that you might've already grabbed for free as a previous Epic Games Store giveaway. So you're not always getting something new to add to your library if you use the Epic Games Store.</p>

			<p>Based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree alone</a>, 2025 did not reach the same bar<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/"> that 2024 did with regard to the DLC and expansions</a> released this past year. It wasn't a bad year, but it just didn't match up. Thankfully, there's at least one upcoming expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment, and a few more on their way that'll help round things out.</p>



<p>Here are our picks for our Most Anticipated DLC/Expansion releases set to come in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Sea-of-Sorrow-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Considering the fact that we went so long without any sign of Hollow Knight Silksong, it almost didn't feel real when its first expansion, Sea of Sorrow, was announced halfway through December 2025. Even more unbelievable (and exciting) was its 2026 release window.</p>



<p>We've gone from no Silksong to a lot of Silksong, and it is by no means a bad thing. The long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's stunning 2D platformer Hollow Knight, Silksong was one of the defining games of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of the year's best, hands-down</a>. We don't know a lot about Sea of Sorrow save from this description Team Cherry gave: "<em></em><em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players</em>."</p>



<p>Sea of Sorrow is sure to be one of the best expansions of the year, and is arguably the one expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-wonder-meetup-in-bellabel-park-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park.png"></a><figcaption><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 last year, we got several upgraded versions of first-party Nintendo titles that didn't just arrive with visual overhauls, but with some small and some fairly-sized expansions along with them. It'll be Super Mario Bros. Wonder's turn to get the same treatment this coming Spring 2026, with the release of the Switch 2 edition and its expansion, Meet Up in Bellabel Park.</p>



<p>Meet Up in Bellabel Park doesn't exactly seem to be a new batch of 2D platforming levels, but something more along the lines of new challenges and mini-games that seem to really expand the co-op capabilities of the game. The whole of it could very well be greater than the sum of its parts. That was definitely the case with some of the Switch 2 versions of games already released.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-the-two-masters-early-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters (Early 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>

<p>Koei Tecmo and Platinum Games' Ninja Gaiden 4 was one of the best action games of 2025. Not only did it make <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Wccftech's list for the Best Action games</a>, but it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominated for Best Action game at The Game Awards 2025</a>. Now, at some point in early 2026, it'll get even better with the release of its first DLC, The Two Masters.</p>



<p>The coming DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/">was revealed before the game's release in October 2025</a>, and while it is currently set for early 2026, we don't yet have a specific release date. When it does arrive, it'll add two new weapons for Ryu and Yakumo, along with new story content for players to dig into and most post-game challenges for those players who really want to test their ninja skills even further than the base game already does.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the new story content, weapons, and challenges come together for a solid DLC addition to what was already a stunning action game. </p>

<p>If you're a fan of GSC Game World's intense survival shooter STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, then at the time of this writing, you might still be going through the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-free-content-on-december-16/">recently released free content update, Stories Untold</a>. While that update added eight new quests, seven new locations, six new characters, a new weapon and a new hub to dig into, it's not the first major DLC for STALKER 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/">That expansion is still to come</a>, which is what GSC Game World told <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/">Wccftech back in November 2025 in an interview with communications director Zakhar Bocharov and technical director Ievgen Kulyk</a>. We don't know a lot about this expansion, though having confirmation from GSC Game World on its 2026 arrival is what helps it make the list of our main picks over one of our picks for honourable mentions.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-midnight-march-2-2026-pc">World of Warcraft: Midnight (March 2, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-of-Warcraft-Midnight.png"></a><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight. Image credit: Blizzard</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the final pick on our main list goes to World of Warcraft: Midnight, the eleventh expansion pack for the long-running MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">that is arriving on March 2, 2026</a>. Midnight introduces a few significant features, including player housing, a new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, a new race, and a new Demon Hunter specialization. Four new zones, eight dungeons, three raids, eleven delves, and a new campaign to follow.</p>



<p>It's a whole bunch more World of Warcraft for players to dig into, and based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">conversation that Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo had with the team back at Gamescom 2025,</a> it'll be one of the more significant expansions in the game's history. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>We can't include every upcoming DLC and expansion in our main picks, but the following honourable mentions still deserve your attention.</p>



<p>A note on our honourable mentions first. The first honourable mention is the Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC. While it seems likely that The Witcher 3 will get one additional expansion after all this time, we don't yet have the confirmation from CD Projekt RED that would make us confident to include it in our main picks. GSC Game World, however, has confirmed that STALKER 2 is getting its first proper DLC in 2026, which is what helps it make the list instead of The Witcher 3 potentially getting an expansion. </p>



<p>If CD Projekt RED were to confirm The Witcher 3 DLC, a return to The Continent would absolutely be one of our most anticipated expansions for the year. But since we don't even know if it's happening, we can only hope it does and represent that hope with the honourable mention below.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC</a> (We hope)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 DLC</li>



<li>Age of Empires IV DLC</li>



<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages DLC</li>
</ul>

			<p>Although modern video games can sometimes be too easy, some players still manage to find a challenge in them by performing extreme feats of mastery that attract the utmost admiration from each game's community.</p>



<p>Despite being a turn-based role-playing game where such feats often boil down to build-perfecting and long hours of grinding, with its parry mechanics, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong> allows for some masterful play that can enable underleveled characters with an unoptimized build to defeat some of the most powerful bosses in the game... <strong>pulling an 8-hour shift.</strong></p>



<p>On the game's <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official subreddit Expedition 33</a></strong>, user <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Recordbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recordbreaks</a></strong> proved their name is no joke by sharing a screenshot of the result screen after their battle against the <strong>Duolliste Boss</strong>, the most difficult boss fight added to the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/"><strong>Thank You Update released for free last month.</strong></a></p>



<p>The numbers on the screenshot speak for themselves. <strong>Recordbreaks</strong> defeated the powerful boss in <strong>8:02:36 minutes</strong>, successfully <strong>parrying 10,545 times</strong> over the boss's two phases, a feat that is made even more impressive not only by the boss's moveset featuring some <strong>unnatural parry timings</strong> meant to throw players off but also by the <strong>huge pressure</strong> this player will have felt during the gruelling 8 hours spent fighting this boss.</p>
