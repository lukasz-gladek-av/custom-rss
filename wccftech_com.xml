			<p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed this past April, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">was one of several third-party games announced for the Switch 2</a>. After multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/">reports</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">hints</a>, Square Enix has officially confirmed that the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will release on Switch 2 and Xbox consoles, along with its release on PlayStation and PC.</p>



<p>Following a release date reveal for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2 during today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct,</a> Square Enix took to <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966514225117118813">X (formerly Twitter)</a> to clarify that not only is Remake Intergrade coming to Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, but that "<em>the remake trilogy will also be making its way to Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox on PC as well as PlayStation 5, Steam and Epic Games Store!</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's good news for Xbox and Switch 2 users who also happen to be Final Fantasy fans, but the only wrinkle in this announcement is whether or not the third, still untitled game in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, will be releasing on Switch 2, Xbox Series devices, and PC simultaneously with its release on PlayStation.</p>



<p>It could still very well be the case that the third and final game in the trilogy is a PlayStation-exclusive title for its first year, or for at least some limited amount of time, before coming to Xbox, Switch 2, and PC.</p>



<p>At least we have official word that these games won't be marooned on PlayStation and PC forever. Now the question turns to whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-producer-naoki-yoshida-and-creative-director-kazutoyo-maehiro-seem-to-drop-a-hint-at-final-fantasy-xvi-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Final Fantasy XVI will be making the jump to Switch 2 as well</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dying Light: The Beast was initially due to release on August 22 2025, but less than a month ahead of that date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">Techland announced it would be delaying it by four weeks</a> to September 19, 2025. Now, Techland has changed the release date once again, this time moving it up by one day from September 19 to September 18, 2025, to celebrate the game surpassing 1 million pre-orders.</p>



<p>"<em>Big news!</em>," Techland began in a <a href="https://x.com/dyinglightgame/status/1966525687247839702?s=46">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>Since more than 1 million players have already secured their copy of Dying Light: The Beast ahead of launch, we're moving the release forward to</em> <em>September 18!"</em></p>



<p>Alongside the post, Techland shared a graphic displaying the new global launch times for the game, telling players exactly when the game will be going live depending on where you live in the world.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Having the release date moved forward is always welcome news for players anxiously waiting to play an upcoming release, even if it might ruin the plans some people may have made to take the Friday off from work to play Dying Light: The Beast. </p>



<p>In the lead-up to launch, Techland <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-combat-parkour-deep-dive/">has been releasing</a> behind-the-scenes <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-bts-creating-dying-light-the-beast-road-to-launch/">looks at the making</a> of Dying Light: The Beast. The most recent was a look at how the studio designed the infected that plague the game's world, and how they developed the voices behind them.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection was <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">first announced this past July</a>, with a release window set for 2026. Today, during the hour-long <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Capcom confirmed that the latest entry in the Monster Hunter Stories series will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this coming March 13, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer showcased today delved more into the game's story and showed off some more gameplay for the upcoming title.</p>

<iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection â€“ Release Date Trailer â€“ Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIVgJyceMZI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3's narrative is kicked off with the birth of Twin Ratholos' with players stepping into the role of the heir to Azuria. "<em>Ride, befriend, raise, and battle with monsters in a vibrant and expansive world filled with a colorful cast of characters</em>," reads the video's description for the trailer. </p>



<p>The game will focus on the divide between two nations, with the birth of the two Ratholos' bringing both a sense of hope and terror, as they could either be part of the solution to the nations not destroying each other, or be the key to that dreaded destruction.</p>



<p>The last Monster Hunter Stories title surpassed <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">2 million units sold</a> as of June 2024, and this follow-up will surely be another strong seller in Capcom's portfolio of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">Monster Hunter games</a> that have been selling like gangbusters. </p>
