			<p>A new entry in the Virtua Fighter series has finally been confirmed to be in the works today.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a> about bringing back classic SEGA franchises like Shinobi and Set Radio across games, movies, and TV, global head of transmedia Justin Scarpone casually confirmed that a new entry in the fighting game series that has been left dormant for years is in development. While nothing else was added about the game, it is very nice to know that the series is about to make a grand comeback.</p>
<p>While welcome, the confirmation of a new Virtua Fighter game currently being in development is hardly surprising, as SEGA somewhat brought the franchise back with Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, an enhanced remake of the fifth entry in the series, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2021. The game bested the publisher's expectations, who did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-successful-future-games-considered/">future plans for the series</a>, which are coming to fruition with the newly announced game, rumored to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-reboot-details/">reboot</a> launching on all major platforms complete with cross-platform play support and rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest entry in the series, Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, on its <a href="https://virtuafighter5us.sega.com/lang/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>It doesn't come as much of a surprise that Pokemon has sold such a massive amount of units on the Nintendo Switch, considering how die-hard the Pokemon community is. Some of the releases on Nintendo Switch have been a bit rockier than others, but overall, they still perform incredibly well. In Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest earnings announcement</a>, it's been confirmed that more than 99 million Pokemon games have been sold for the Nintendo Switch alone. Considering that Nintendo has been struggling a fair bit this year, this seems like a significant milestone and achievement to hit amidst the lull in record-breaking releases.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch launched in 2017 and is still going relatively strong despite the hardware's beginning to age. At this time, we've seen the Nintendo Switch Lite and the Nintendo Switch OLED be released, with a successor to the Nintendo Switch being announced in the past year. More details of this successor are meant to be announced within this fiscal year, but it seems to be slipping away quickly, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/">minimal further information</a> coming out. However, it was announced that the successor of the Nintendo Switch will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a>, which is a huge relief to many.</p>
<p>Since the release of the Nintendo Switch, plenty of games within the Pokemon universe have been released, such as Pokemon Let's Go, Pokemon Sword and Shield, and even some of the older titles like the original Pokemon Snap being available with the use of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Their most recent title, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet seems to have been the rockiest one so far, as the graphics weren't what fans were hoping for, and even today, the game is heavily riddled with bugs in both solo and co-op play.</p>
<p>Pokemon Legends: Arceus did incredibly well despite the drastic changes they took when creating this game. You could go out and throw Poke balls at Pokemon without battling, and there were 'boss' fights to participate in, as well as side quests. It felt more like an RPG than a creature collector or pet battler game. The next Pokemon game is due to release in 2025, and is another Pokemon Legends game. The title is called Pokemon Legends: Z-A, taking players back to the Kalos region.</p>
<p>When it comes to franchises performing well on the Nintendo Switch, both Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda are highly successful, with the Zelda franchise selling over 53 million units on Switch. Despite that, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe remains the best-selling Switch game of all time, with more than 64 million copies sold.</p>

			<p>According to two prominent insiders, Fortnite Season OG will return permanently in December. The news was reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1853920988594930095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1853920981682704412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who received the information from an anonymous source and were able to confirm its veracity. They also said all Fortnite Chapter 1 seasons would return monthly with an OG item pool. Moreover, both Build and Zero Build modes will be available. The announcement is expected at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 12, starting at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Fortnite Season OG <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> for the first time last November, marking record player numbers for Epic. The first day after the relaunch, the Battle Royale game registered the biggest day in its history with more than 44.7 million players. It came at the right time, too: just a few months before, Epic had been forced to lay off sixteen percent of its workforce. Fortnite's comeback, which started with Season OG, was largely responsible for a much healthier state of the company's finances.</p>
<p>Epic seems to have figured out Fortnite users are really into nostalgia. Right now, there's the Chapter 2 Remix season <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-is-live-now-brand-new-kicks-cosmetics-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on live servers. Are you enjoying it? What do you think about these returning seasons? Let us know in the comments.</p>
