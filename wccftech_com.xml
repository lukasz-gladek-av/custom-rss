			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>and is already off to a great start. It's been blowing up on social media and has received nonstop buzz online. At the moment, it has a Mostly Positive review rating on Steam. This game has been wanted by Dragon Age fans for a long time, as Dragon Age: Inquisition was released in 2014, making it a whopping 10-year wait for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The latest game in the Dragon Age franchise had been in development for years by 2020 and was in deep water by that point. It had been rebooted from a single-player game into a live-service game with heavy multiplayer elements, a component often seen in recent EA games, including games like Anthem. As we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> at the time, some employees within the company were referring to the next Dragon Age game as "Anthem with dragons." Once Gary McKay <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-confirms-gary-mckay-as-gm-success-is-all-about-rebuilding-our-reputation-and-delivering-on-our-promise-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took over</a> in 2020, he was determined to make sure that the same mistakes were not made when creating Dragon Age: The Veilguard. After he took over, he began to meet with some of the leadership in BioWare and EA and made the decision to take Dragon Age back to single-player.</p>
<p>This information comes from a report&nbsp;<span>by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-01/-dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-high-stakes-at-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier at Bloomberg</a>, where Gary McKay's thought process behind this game was explained in detail. For McKay, it made perfect sense to revert the game back to single-player</span>, as games like Anthem didn't succeed, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a huge hit with fans of Star Wars and those who weren't.</p>
<p>"Once we made that decision, a lot of things started to fall into place," said McKay. However, there were other setbacks and obstacles. The pandemic was a huge one, as BioWare had to start hiring people remotely, which "made for cultural challenges," said McKay. As a result, the game didn't come out by its original target date; instead, it came out this week. Last summer, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-layoffs-mass-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw</a> a layoff of 50 people at BioWare, which included some of the company's top names. McKay said in the interview with Schreier that the industry "was all about focus at that time. When you have a really large team, you're always compelled to keep everybody busy all the time. When you have a smaller team, you have the right people in the right roles at the right time; some incredible momentum is gained at that point."</p>
<p>So far, Dragon Age: The Veilguard seems to be performing well, but neither EA nor BioWare have released any numbers at this point. It's uncertain whether they will, but it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/">currently topping charts on Steam</a>. Maybe this is the boost both BioWare and EA need to start developing some great games in the future, too.</p>

			<p>Remedy's Alan Wake 2 was a resounding critical success when it launched last year. It matched the studio's historic highest Metacritic score (Max Payne's 89). Here on Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score from Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Despite not aiming to revolutionize the survival horror genre, Alan Wake II is an amazing game that no one who enjoys a good trippy horror story should pass on. Remedy Entertainment really outdid themselves, releasing their best game to date and one of the most immersive gaming experiences of the past few years.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn't quite sell Gangbusters. Back in March, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-alan-wake-2-has-recouped-most-of-the-investment-studio-plans-more-regular-sequels-for-aw-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Alan Wake 2 had recouped 'most' of its investment. The latest report that the Finnish company <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> today makes it sound like Alan Wake 2 barely went forward—the game still hasn't recouped all the costs.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the quarter, Alan Wake 2 had recouped most of its development and marketing expenses. After the end of the quarter, the second expansion of Alan Wake 2, The Lake House, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on October 22 alongside the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game.</em></p>
<p>Remedy's games were never really huge mainstream hits. Still, two factors probably contributed to the relatively low sales. For one thing, they launched the game only in digital stores, but that's now been rectified, as mentioned above; the retail debut might bring in a few more players. More importantly, Epic Games funded the game's development and therefore secured a permanent exclusive for its own store on PC. This meant no release on Steam, which would have certainly brought in a larger audience. On the other hand, without Epic Games, Alan Wake 2 might not have been made at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala also addressed investors on the status of the future projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, previously codename Condor, continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Control 2 has progressed well in the production readiness stage and is on track to start full production during 2025. Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested in preparation for full production.</em></li>
<li><em>Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making steady progress in full production. The development team continues their work, gradually reaching important milestones.</em></li>
</ul>
