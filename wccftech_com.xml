			<p>A Kingdom Come Deliverance remaster or upgraded version is rumored to be in the works for an early 2026 release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bertik11/">bertik11</a>, who shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1nuoprk/warhorse_studio_upcoming_upgrade_and_fantasy_game/">Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a> that the first entry in the series by Warhorse Studios will get an upgrade early next year, between January and April. The user added that the studio is not working on a new Lord of the Rings game as rumored, but is still working on their own fantasy game.</p>



<p>While a rumor coming from an unspecified source should be taken with a massive grain of salt, bertik11 proved reliable regarding Kingdom Come Deliverance series rumors. Last year, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1erxl3d/kingdom_come_deliverance_2_is_coming_in_2025/">revealed that Kingdom Come Deliverance II would be delayed to 2025</a> before the official announcement was made and that the game's Gamescom booth would have a medieval village design, which turned out to be the case, so there's a good chance they indeed have access to insider information.</p>



<p>Although Kingdom Come Deliverance was a solid role-playing game when it launched back in 2018, a remaster would improve the experience considerably if it addressed some of its most critical issues. Quality-of-life improvements, in particular, would make it a much more accessible game, improving its steep learning curve and interface to make it easier for those who only played its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">excellent sequel</a> to get into the game and experience the beginning of Henry of Skalitz's story for themselves.</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn recently released native Steam Deck build delivers significant performance improvements over the original Proton Windows build, according to a new comparison video.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a>, the new build of the survival-horror game developed by Bloober Team runs much better than the original Proton Windows build in nearly every comparison.</p>



<p>While hitting a steady 60 FPS is something the Steam Deck obviously can't do, even with a native build, the performance improvement it brings makes the game often run above 30 FPS, even in demanding areas like the Apartment Complex, where the system struggles to even hit 30 FPS with the Proton Windows build.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos The New Dawn: NEW Steam Deck Native Build Performance Vs Proton Windows Version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k1FFgbBofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While any game benefits greatly from a 60 frames per second framerate and higher, with its slower-paced survival-horror experience, Cronos: The New Dawn is more than enjoyable even at 30 FPS, as it relies mostly on atmosphere to deliver one of the finest games released by Bloober Team. You can learn more about it by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">checking out my review.</a></p>



<p>The release of native Steam Deck builds is a relatively recent happening, but one that is extremely welcome to extend the life of the system which essentially started the PC handheld craze of the past couple of years. <span>Besides the Cronos: The New Dawn build, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">B</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">aldur's Gate 3 native Steam Deck build is also now available for download</a>, introducing performance improvements in the city of Baldur's Gate in Act 3, one of the most demanding areas in the game.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Pocketpair's announcement that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would launch version 1.0 of Palworld in 2026</a>, industry veteran Yoshiki Okamoto, who has worked for a long time as a designer at CAPCOM on series like Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Dino Crisis, and more, shared his opinion on the situation with Nintendo's Pokémon in a video message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIhdKKNRnI0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on his personal YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p><em>I personally believe Palworld crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable. I don't want it to be like, it's okay because it sold well, or because it was fun, or because it has good reviews. If a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think Palworld will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that's being sued, so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game, you are supporting it, so please do not buy it.</em></p>



<p>However, Okamoto's opinion was met with a mixed reception. Several fans pointed out that some of the games he worked on also featured very similar elements to games that were released before. </p>



<p>As a reminder, Nintendo notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the developer in September 2024</a>, alleging infringement of patent rights, and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued in court</a> that game mods do not count as 'prior art'. The ongoing lawsuit forced Pocketpair to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make some changes to the game</a>, such as removing the ability to summon Pals with spheres, earlier this year.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Pocketpair announced a farming sim spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>) just eleven days after Nintendo unveiled its own cozy farming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, currently in development at Koei Tecmo for a planned 2026 release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/d-d-co-op-game-project-baxter-is-canceled-by-starbreeze-to-refocus-on-payday-franchise.1314538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Baxter, the D&amp;D based cooperative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in December 2023</a> by Starbreeze, has been canceled by the Swedish game developer. The news was <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared this morning by Starbreeze</a>, which is 'refocusing' on its owned IP, PAYDAY, according to CEO Adolf Kristjansson:</p>



<p><em>I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into PAYDAY and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on PAYDAY, we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.</em></p>



<p>Project Baxter was slated to launch in 2026, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in the pre-production phase in February 2024</a>, which made us skeptical at the time. The decision to discontinue this D&amp;D game might have been a mix of problems with the project and the desire to fix the PAYDAY franchise, which has suffered due to the poor reception of the third installment and, more recently, due to the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PAYDAY 2 subscription</a> and the simultaneous (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reverted</a>) price increase of the Infamous Collection DLC bundle. This cancellation comes with a write-off of a $27 million investment for the game and the decision to fire around 44 employees between internal developers and external contractors.</p>



<p>Perhaps at some point, we'll get a glimpse of footage of Project Baxter to see what could have been.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It happened in June</a>&nbsp;with the canceled D&amp;D open-world RPG that was in development at Hidden Path.</p>



<p>As a Dungeons and Dragons fan, I hope no more games attached to the franchise get canceled. There's still a healthy lineup on the way, between Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked (out in 2025), a new game from Invoke (the studio behind Dark Alliance), and an action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull. Last month, the president of Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confided that he'd love to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG</a>, though he also suggested it won't be happening any time soon, if at all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-producer-says-game%E2%80%99s-reception-was-unexpectedly-positive-but-future-games-won%E2%80%99t-necessarily-follow-this-formula.1314502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that even the developers of Silent Hill f did not anticipate such a positive reaction from critics and fans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on an IGN Japan livestream during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, producer Motoi Okamoto said:</p>



<p><em>I'm grateful that it was rated higher than I'd expected. I think you'll understand if you play it, but since it's a game with a lot of challenges, I thought there might be some pros and cons, but it's been very well received, and it has a Metascore of 86, the same as the Silent Hill 2 remake. Well, I was really surprised.</em></p>



<p>That doesn't necessarily mean future installments will follow the Silent Hill f formula, though:</p>



<p><em>We'll be putting out something different, with a different flavor. We want to explore all sorts of different aspects of game design and story.</em></p>



<p>Later, Okamoto clarified his statement <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a tweet published on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>As I said in the interview, not all future Silent Hill games will have the same gameplay as f, but rather I want the series to always be challenging in a good way, so that players can enjoy a different flavor of gameplay with each installment.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, there are some things that will remain the same, the most important of which is the quality of the story. I am convinced that a psychological story is essential to what makes Silent Hill unique, and I will continue to focus on that point and release future titles with confidence.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/judas-is-similar-to-bioshock-in-some-ways-but-also-radically-different-in-others-says-creator.1314469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Award-winning game designer and writer Ken Levine, known for his work on System Shock 2 and the BioShock franchise, talked about the similarities and differences of those games with his next title, Judas, currently in development at Ghost Story Games.</p>



<p>In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published this week by YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, Levine claimed that while there are familiar elements (such as dual-wielding powers and weapons), Judas will be radically different in many ways. He also said it can be considered somewhere between BioShock and the first System Shock, meaning it's more complex and offers greater player expression and depth than the most recent BioShock titles.</p>



<p><em>There are parts of Judas that are more similar to Bioshock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different and it's nice to have some things that you're familiar with. I'm sure people noticed there's a gun in one hand and you got powers in the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much, but the way the game works and the way the game is populated and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. The way the story is delivered, too. It was good to start with some basis, but this is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since, you know, since I did BioShock. This is more of a departure in some ways than BioShock was to System Shock 2.</em></p>



<p><em>Judas is sort of somewhere between BioShock and System Shock, not between BioShock and System Shock 2, in terms of its depth. It's just a bigger game and a more complex game, but it's in service of doing something we started in BioShock Infinite, which is really how do you build a relationship with characters in games that feels way more granular than you normally see in games where you're really just making a few big choices, but really low-level reaction and commentary, being able to play people off of each other and feeling people getting angry at you and then being able to pull them back from the edge of that anger to and then maybe piss somebody off at the same time. That was what we're most interested in. Also, Infinite felt a little light to me on player expression, so we went back a little more towards player expression and build depth.</em></p>



<p>Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first discussed the 'narrative LEGOs' concept around ten years ago</a>. It wasn't until The Game Awards 2022 that Ghost Story Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled Judas as its debut project</a>, but fans had to wait until March 2024 to get a lot more info from the man <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a massive 75-minute interview featuring Geoff Keighley, Ryan McCaffrey, and Levine himself</a>. </p>



<p>In late August, Ghost Story Games shared the first developer log <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/388860/view/538863491448045972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, confirming that work had finished on the Villainy feature that will ensure emergent gameplay between the player and the game's three potential villains:</p>



<p><em>When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals.</em></p>



<p>Judas still has no official release date, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included it in the company's 2026 lineup</a>.</p>
