			<p>Today, publisher Focus Entertainment proudly <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1933192827170627788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has surpassed the enviable milestone of seven million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive's third-person shooter game launched on September 9, 2024, and immediately became a hit. The following day, Focus Home <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that two million copies had already been sold. Those <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became</a> five million units near the end of November.</p>
<p>A sequel was already inevitable at that point, though we weren't expecting an announcement anytime soon. Instead, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development as early as this March, promising even larger battles.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean support for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is ending anytime soon. In fact, at the recent 2025 Skulls event, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-games-roundup-from-2025-skulls-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-updates-for-darktide-and-space-marine-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Siege Mode is being added to the game in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a detailed overview of Siege Mode provided by Saber Interactive:</p>
<p><em>The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</em></p>
<p><em>Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications. Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</em></p>
<p><em>Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li>
<li><em>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</em></li>
<li><em>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower.</em></li>
<li><em>Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>The launch for Build A Rocket Boy's debut game, MindsEye, hasn't exactly gone the way the studio would have hoped. The simple fact that PlayStation, a company that very rarely gives players refunds for purchases on the PS Store, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">is giving players refunds for their purchases of MindsEye</a>&nbsp;says a lot about how things are going on its own.</p>
<p>Shortly after players started to publicly announce they had gotten refunds from PlayStation, and as more videos of bugs and long statements from players appear on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/">Reddit,</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy released a <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933167455238594939">statement to the game's official X account</a>, saying that the team is "<em>heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also pinned the issues the game is having on a memory leak, claiming that "<em>roughly 1 in 10 of our players</em>" were impacted by this issue, and that a hotfix has been made to fix the problem. That fix, along with a few more that Build A Rocket Boy detailed in its statement, will be pushed to players starting tomorrow, with more fixes to come throughout the weekend, continuing on through next week, and basically through the rest of the month.</p>
<p>"<em>We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates</em>," the studio continued in its statement. "<em>We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback. Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support - it truly means the world to us. We're grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us</em>."</p>
<p>For this weekend, Build A Rocket Boy says the first hotfix for MindsEye will include:</p>

<p>Over the course of next week, the game's second hotfix will include:</p>

			<p>Just last week, Konami announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/">Silent Hill f</a> would arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, on September 25, 2025, and today, during the company's Press Start presentation, we got our latest developed deep-dive from Konami, and a Japanese studio it collaborated with on Silent Hill f, Neobards.</p>
<p>Members from both Konami and Neobards talked about how the teams worked together to evolve the design of Silent Hill f to both keep the essence of a Silent Hill game, while leaning into the fact that the game is not set in the western town of Silent Hill, but in Japan, and is going for a Japanese style of horror story than anything else in the series so far.</p>
<p>"<em>The setting of Silent Hill f has shifted from the town of Silent Hill to Japan,</em>" said Silent Hill series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamoto. "<em>But it remains a psychological horror experience where one confronts themselves within a mental world. Taking into account that it is a psychological horror, we sought to enhance the essence of Japanese-style horror. The hallmark of Japanese horror is not simply grotesqueness, but the coexistence of beauty and the disturbing. We are creating this title with the concept: Find the beauty in terror</em>."</p>

<p>Neobards game director, Al Yang, added, "<em>We created our visual designs to have a distinct uneasiness to them, but also have a horrific charm that would make it so you just couldn't stop staring. In this matter, we were extremely fortunate to be able to work with Kera-san to design our key character art, as their designs perfectly suited the ideal of 'Beauty in Terror'.</em>"</p>

<p>We also heard from the game's scriptwriter, Ryukishi07, who discussed how he connected elements of present-day Japan with how different Japan was in the 1960s, which isn't exactly that long ago but is still very different compared to modern-day Japan.</p>
<p>With Silent Hill f's launch still months away, we'll likely hear and see more about the game before its release, but even now it feels safe to say that this is shaping up to potentially be one of the most terrifying Silent Hill games yet.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f also wasn't the only Silent Hill game featured during Konami's presentation, as the company also announced that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDORsTHAQSs">Bloober Team</a> would be back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake the first Silent Hill game</a>.</p>
