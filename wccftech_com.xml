			<p>With the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/until-dawn/">Until Dawn</a> back in 2015, Supermassive Games proved that horror games can work well even with a narrative focus lacking many of the mechanics fans have come to associate with the genre following the launch of the Resident Evil series. This narrative focus has continued to be predominant in every other horror game developed by the studio, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/">The Quarry</a>, the Dead by Daylight spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-dark-pictures-anthology/">The Dark Pictures Anthology</a> series, which has quickly become the studio's most popular franchise. In 2026, four years after the launch of The Devil in Me, the series is set to continue with Directive 8020, which will be, by all accounts, one of the most important entries in the franchise, as it will enrich the studio's typical narrative focus with new gameplay elements that edge closer to those a traditional survival horror game usually offers.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out the first 30 minutes or so of the full game, accompanying Carter and Simms across the colony ship Cassiopeia as they attempt to fix a hull breach. However, what begins as a regular routine fix quickly turns into a nightmare, as the two characters meet a dangerous shapeshifting alien from which they need to get away. With a beautifully haunting atmosphere at times reminiscent of the Alien franchise, navigating the dimly lit corridors of the spaceship was a spooky experience with a mounting tension that resolved, in my playthrough, with a terrible outcome: I couldn't prevent Carter from dying.</p>

<p>While the overview above may sound very familiar to any fan of The Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 feels quite different from previous entries in the series thanks to some new mechanics. The most important addition to the experience is Real Time Threats, which players must deal with in a limited time by staying hidden from any dangerous presence, using the appropriate tools when needed, and completing Quick Time Events. Making decisions will continue to play a big role in the experience, as what players decide will go on to influence the Destiny of any given character. Each character will have two, and which they will fall into depends on how the choices made during the game will shape up characters' traits, leading to different outcomes at certain points in the story. Experimenting with different outcomes with be easier than ever before with the Turning Points system, which will allow players to revisit decisions and delve depeer into the story without having to complete multiple playthroughs.</p>



<p>With a very different setting than usual, a high-profile cast for the main characters and more involving gameplay, Directive 8020 is set to mark a new beginning for The Dark Pictures Anthology, moving the franchise closer to survival horror without doing away with the narrative focus that's become the trademark for Supermassive Games. To see if this new approach will work as well as it did in the game's first few minutes, fans of the series will have to wait until<a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/"> next year</a> when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/">gameplay and concept footage</a> of what would've been the sequel to Human Head Studios' 2006 game Prey leaked online, published on YouTube across multiple videos from a channel listed under '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.' Today, that same channel no longer has any of the Prey 2 videos it previously had publicly listed, and instead, more gameplay footage appeared on an old <a href="https://forums.duke4.net/topic/12181-leaked-prey-1995/page__pid__385337#entry385337">Duke4 thread</a>, spotted by New Blood Interactive's <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1964840297889997048">Dave Oshry</a>.</p>



<p>The original post includes an Imgur link, though following it at the time of this writing is fruitless, sense the page no longer appears. Oshry, however, compiled the footage and put it together in a nearly five-minute-long video that shows a very solid-looking slice of what Human Head Studios was cooking up with Prey 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The footage shows that Human Head Studios was building something that, if it had made it to release, would've been compared to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, since it appears to be well ahead of its time with the kind of sci-fi world and setting it would have featured.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is actually the third time in the last week that Human Head Studios' Prey has come up. In a <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">recent interview</a> with former Bethesda executive Pete Hines, besides Hines taking the time to comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">on subscription services and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass</a>, he also talked about the struggle he faced when it came time to decide what Arkane Austin would work on next, and how he lost in the battle for its name. </p>



<p>"<em>Don't even get me started on that</em>," Hines said in regard to Arkane Austin naming its 2017 game Prey. "<em>I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name. I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team – brand, PR and community – and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game. I regret that I lost that battle. But nobody on this planet could have put more of a good faith effort into changing minds on that. My whole point was, look how much time we spend talking about what the game is versus why it's called this and like, that is wasted energy. That is wasted excitement. We could be turning that into something positive.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if more Prey 2 footage is published, or if an unreleased build of what Human Head Studios had appears online. For now, we can only watch and wonder at what might've been if Human Head's story had gone differently.</p>
