			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>

This release will see the puzzle game launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. For those who are on PC, a demo is now available to play as part of Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>If you've played this game before and plan on picking up the remastered version, it will still have the same story that you loved, but now it will look better than ever, as it was rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. As a result, the Simulation world you explore is now more detailed than ever, introducing enhanced textures, lighting, and environmental design to upgrade the experience of the original Talos Principle experience.</p>
<p>Alongside the game, you'll also get to experience the acclaimed expansion, Road to Gehenna, where you'll get the opportunity to play through the new chapter, In the Beginning. This is a brand-new addition that dives into the beginning of the Simulation, where new layers are added to the complex story of The Talos Principle.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy the head-scratching puzzles that are featured in The Talos Principle, there will be a brand new Puzzle Editor, which allows creative minds to create new puzzles for players to take on, as well as new worlds to explore.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether this game is for you and you're on PC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a demo</a> for The Talos Principle: Reawakened currently available on Steam. This demo will give you access to a medieval environment where there are plenty of puzzles and challenges to undertake. The puzzles available in the demo have been cherry-picked to showcase some of the key mechanics that are utilized in the game. This includes laser connectors, pressure plates, and force-field jammers.</p>
<p>Along with this, you will be given the opportunity to try out the fully-featured Puzzle Editor, where you can build your own worlds and create your own challenges for other players to take on, giving control back to the dedicated modding community.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened will fully launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on April 10.</p>
