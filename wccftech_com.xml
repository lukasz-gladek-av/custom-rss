			<p>Valve fans had a field day <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the announcements of the Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller</a>, with the notable exception of those who have been pining for Half-Life 3.</p>



<p>The near-mythological third (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly final</a>) installment in the sci-fi first-person shooter franchise was still nowhere to be mentioned by Valve, but that doesn't mean it's not coming. In fact, several insiders have doubled down to reiterate that a dedicated game announcement is on its way in relatively short order.</p>



<p>What they do not quite agree on is the timing of the news. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Gabe Follower</a>, a Counter-Strike 2 content creator who correctly leaked information on Deadlock (the studio's next third-person multiplayer shooter/MOBA game in early development), Half-Life 3, codenamed HLX, will still be announced before the end of the year. Another Valve insider, Tyler McVicker, who leaked some Half-Life: Alyx details, maintained <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2618496266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Twitch stream</a> that he expects the news to drop within the next two to three weeks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?si=51br6QSKysH8bA3f&amp;t=2122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>, though, the resident insiders shared a different opinion based on their own sources. Mike Straw, who previously mentioned the hardware announcements weren't all Valve had to unveil, said this particular news will not be made official during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025 event next month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming founder and renowned leaker Tom Henderson added that he heard there's a big (currently unannounced) game coming in March. With the Steam Machine/Frame/Controller scheduled to launch in early 2026, it makes sense that Half-Life 3 would be a launch title, especially for the new Steam Machine.</p>



<p>After all, Valve publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it believes having more games will be key to the success of the Steam Machine compared to its previous iteration. While they were mainly referring to the massive Steam library, new launches of gaming platforms have benefited from having the so-called killer application since time immemorial in this industry. If Half-Life 3 were only available on Steam platforms, it'd mean the only console-like platform able to play it would be the Steam Machine, thus undoubtedly boosting its initial sales.</p>

			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-guide-how-to-get-your-custom-loadout">Battlefield REDSEC Guide - How to Get Your Custom Loadout</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>
