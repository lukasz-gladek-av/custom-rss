			<p>In a new gameplay trailer shared by IGN, players get a glimpse at what's to come in STALKER 2 and what weaponry and ammo will be available. It also shows off the gun attachments you'll get access to throughout the game. Since the original STALKER came out, it's been 17 years, and there have been major technological advancements since then. STALKER 2 is set to use Unreal Engine 5, and so far, all teasers and trailers have showcased amazing graphics. However, games using Unreal Engine 5 have been known to be temperamental. Despite this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/">the developers have promised</a> that the game will remain stable at all times. If you want to know what weapons and kit you can expect in STALKER 2, make sure to check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the video, the graphics and environments shown are absolutely stunning and are extremely detailed. It shows off how you can loot from bodies on the ground, as well as what your inventory will look like, something that can be a huge deterrent in games, depending on how it's handled. In the video, it seems as if each item you pick up is a specific shape or size, and you will be required to do a bit of Tetris to be able to fit items together. This sort of inventory is often seen in survival games and is commonly seen in the Resident Evil franchise. This can be fun but also serves as its own challenge. Each item also has its own weight, which can lead to over-encumbrance if you carry too much, as shown in the video.</p>
<p>The video also shows off some of the combat that you can expect in STALKER 2, as well as methods of self-preservation, which includes quickly bandaging yourself in sticky situations. The video released by GSC Game World shows how the world can go from derelict and barren to chaotic and dangerous in seconds, always showing that you have to be on your guard.</p>
<p>There are a variety of weapons that will be available and a lot of different attachments you can get, including 2x and 4x Scopes if you're someone who likes to use Sniper Rifles or want to be stealthy about your kills and take out your enemies from a vantage point.</p>
<p>The release date for STALKER 2 ebbs ever closer and is set for release on November 20 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>, the Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl?</p>
