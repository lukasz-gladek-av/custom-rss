			<p>Battlefield 6 has been out on PC and consoles for three days at the time of this writing, and already, players are getting frustrated with the XP grind to unlock new weapons and attachments. So, players have turned to an old workaround for Battlefield games: create a custom server in Portal, and farm XP in bot matches. EA, for its part, is trying to stop players from boosting by shutting down the more popular farms, but players can always make new ones.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-6-fast-xp-farms-progression-times-portal-ea-response">VG247</a>, a select few Portal servers were popularized when YouTubers and content creators began making videos with titles like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5Df2dvxC0"><em>How to Unlock Weapons, Attachments, Gadgets, and Soldiers Faster in Battlefield 6</em>.</a>" Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4n1c3/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> were also sharing codes to let other players find their XP-farming servers, as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5f660/weapon_attachments/">community has seemingly rallied around the feeling</a> that earning XP for weapons, attachments, gadgets, and soldiers is <em>"ridiculously slow</em>."</p>



<p>In response to players using Portal for XP farming, EA seems to be shutting down the more popular servers, and players are now running into error messages telling them that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5emdf/biggest_shit_take_of_all_launch/">EA's servers "<em>are at max capacity</em>," </a>stopping players from creating new servers.</p>



<p>Of course, this won't last forever, and EA can't exactly play an endless game of whack-a-mole with Portal servers to try and stop everyone from doing any amount of XP farming. It's also not like Battlefield 6 is the first Battlefield game where players have turned to Portal for this exact reason.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">Even in our review</a> of Battlefield 6, we noted that the grind for weapons and attachments, specifically those that can only be unlocked through certain situational challenges, wasn't something we particularly liked, even if it can be seen as a way of changing up the tried-and-true method of just levelling up your character and weapon to unlock everything. </p>



<p>Since theoretically, you could jump into matches and focus on only completing those challenges where possible. But that's not exactly the way to play if you're just trying to have a good time in Battlefield 6, or any multiplayer game, for that matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll see EA stop its whack-a-mole game and adjust some of the situational challenges and XP requirements so that players can unlock what they want, without too much hassle, and the game can find its meta more naturally. Rather than it becoming a case of 'players who farmed XP in Portal vs. players who didn't,' and since only one of those sides is going to have better and more weapons, attachments, and gadgets available to them, it's pretty clear which side is coming out on top.</p>

			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1976774165207060716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1976774165207060716%7Ctwgr%5E189fd63311bfa1ba40ae994f5c95a230fe717dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Fglen-powell-wants-a-part-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-movie-1616433%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> during this weekend's New York Comic-Con 2025, Hollywood star Glen Powell revealed that he has been playing (and enjoying) Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a lot lately, and he'd like to be in the movie, too.</p>



<p><em>Expedition 33 is one of that I've become a fan of. If there's an Expedition 33 movie, I'd be very interested.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear whether Glen Powell is aware that a live action adaptation of the game was announced in January 2025, before the game's launch (which happened on April 24). The film will be produced by Story Kitchen, formerly known as dj2 Entertainment, a production company focused specifically on adapting game IPs. They already have experience with the successful Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and also have signed deals to bring many other franchises to the big and small screen, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, Sifu, and Vampire Survivors.</p>



<p>Casting for the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 movie is yet to be announced. Of course, Glen Powell would be a big get. Following his roles in Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man, Anyone but You, Twisters, and Chad Powers, Powell is now one of the top leading actors in Hollywood. His next appearances will be in The Running Man, an Edgar Wright-directed film adapted from the 1982 dystopian novel by Stephen King, and Ghostwriter, J.J. Abrams' next fantasy movie.</p>



<p>Can Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive afford him, though? Sure, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has surpassed five million copies sold, which is certainly much more than they were expecting. </p>



<p>At any rate, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-future-update-to-add-new-location-costumes-and-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are preparing a free update</a> that will add new late game bosses and a brand new location to explore to the game. This will be a thank-you for the whole community.</p>
