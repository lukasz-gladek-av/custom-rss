			<p>Fans of the dragon-themed platform series owned by <strong>Activision</strong> are getting an early Holiday present this year with the leaked news that a <strong>Spyro 4</strong> game is in development. The information was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQsIoR2rXk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Canadian Guy Eh', who noticed that a former <strong>Toys for Bob</strong> developer included on his LinkedIn resume that he worked on 'Spyro' for nearly two years up until March 2024.</p>



<p>Given the timeline, this cannot possibly be related to the <strong>Reignited Trilogy</strong>, which was first released on November 13, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-confirmed-for-pc-switch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted on PC and Nintendo Switch</a> on September 3, 2019. Chances are, then, this is the next project in development at Toys for Bob.</p>



<p>Some readers may recall that the studio, based in Novato, California, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-developer-suffers-layoffs-will-work-on-call-of-duty-warzone-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assigned to assist with Call of Duty Warzone</a> for a period of time in 2021. Toys for Bob later launched <strong>Crash Team Rumble</strong>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-rumble-is-all-about-taking-platforming-into-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4v4 team-based multiplayer game</a>, in June 2023. The game wasn't received well, though, and by March 2024, the studio had decided to separate from Activision (and therefore from its new owner, Microsoft), <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-goes-indie-but-will-still-likely-partner-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regaining its independence</a>. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bobs-first-independent-game-will-still-be-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, their first independent project is still expected to be made in partnership with Microsoft and, therefore, based on one of its IPs, of which Spyro is certainly one they're familiar with.</p>



<p>A Spyro 4 rumor actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-4-teased-in-crash-4-its-about-time-art-book-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first circulated five years ago</a>, when it was discovered that the official art book of the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></strong> (also developed by Toys for Bob) included new concept art related to the cute purple dragon.</p>



<p>While we wait for an official announcement, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/spyro-reignited-trilogy-classics-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Reignited Trilogy</a> is currently available at a 65% discount on PC (Steam) and Xbox, whereas PlayStation users can only buy it at full price ($39.99) right now via the PlayStation Store. Spyro Reignited Trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can also be found on the Game Pass subscription</a> service at the Premium and Ultimate tiers.</p>



<p>Additionally, we just published our list of the <strong>Best Platform Games</strong> released this year. Check it out <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the video game industry's most renowned and respected creators, tragically died this past Sunday after a fatal car crash. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-died-in-car-crash-call-of-duty-apex-legends-battlefield/">The news didn't break until yesterday</a>, and across the video game industry, game developers, players, and everyone in between have shared messages of sadness upon hearing of his death and condolences to Vince Zampella's family and loved ones.</p>



<p>Zampella was, in every way, a titan of the modern video game industry. As a co-founder of Infinity Ward and a co-creator of Call of Duty, he left an immeasurable impact and legacy on video games and the modern video game industry, though to the people he worked with and who knew him, the impact they had on their lives will be the one they remember most.</p>



<p>One of the stories shared comes from Robert Bowling, a game developer and current studio head at Weatherfoot LLC, who worked on music for Call of Duty 2, 4, Modern Warfare 2, and Modern Warfare 3. The post he shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fourzerotwo_i-loved-vince-zampella-unconditionally-and-activity-7408978227269971969-fsKG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">on his personal LinkedIn account</a> is incredibly touching and a stunning example of the kind of person Zampella was.</p>



<p><em>"He has protected me and rescued me from tragedy, when I've been at the bottom, he'd find a way to nestle up next to me there and provide the ladder to climb up. When my father passed, he asked me to stay at his house, he knew I needed a shoulder and space to share my grief. He secretly paid for my Dad's entire funeral (with full military honors). Whenever something happened in my life, Vince was the</em> <em>first text I'd receive to make sure I was okay</em>."</p>



<p>Bowling goes on to say that he, and "<em>everyone he [Zampella] ever met had countless stories like this, full of unfiltered kindness, understanding, and generosity</em>," and even from a quick look into the comments of Bowling's post, it's clear he wasn't exaggerating. Just below his story is another, more comical story of Zampella pretending to grill a colleague for a hiring decision, before letting him in on the gag.</p>



<p>Laura Miele, head of EA's Entertainment division and one of the lead executives who worked closely with Zampella, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ealaura-miele_yesterday-we-lost-vince-zampella-an-icon-activity-7409023999239970816-E3xD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on her LinkedIn</a>, "<em>He was a wickedly talented creator whose honesty, grounded approach, and sharp perspective made everyone around him better. Vince was a dear friend of mine who challenged me in the best ways and made my work more meaningful, not to mention a lot more fun. Beyond his extraordinary professional legacy, he was also a remarkable dad, which is something I deeply admired about him. I loved him dearly and will miss him more than words can say.</em>"</p>



<p>Jordan DeVires, a UI/UX designer at Respawn who worked on the Star Wars Jedi series, <a href="https://x.com/theastralj/status/2003200678253199585">said of Zampella</a>, "<em>As a creative he had my two favorite qualities: he always had an opinion and he always gave it to you straight. I wouldn't get to work on video games (let alone star wars games) if it weren't for what Vince made. My heart goes out to his loved ones and those that knew him best.</em>"</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2003400118868046169">Hideo Kojima also shared his own story of Zampella</a>, providing a bit of insight into the relationship they shared, and how Zampella reached out to Kojima when he was starting his own independence journey and opening Kojima Productions. </p>



<p>"<em>I first met Vince during his time at Infinity Ward, when he and Jason were creating “COD: MW2.” After they were forced out of Infinity Ward, Vince went on to found Respawn. When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways. He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures. I honestly don’t have the words. It’s far too soon. This is heartbreaking. R.I.P. Vince.</em>" </p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada stepped in to add, "<em>I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Vince Zampella. He was a creator who reshaped modern gaming and left an indelible mark on the industry through his vision, leadership, and commitment to quality. His work set new standards for competitive play and player experience, influencing countless developers across genres.</em>" Harada continued to say that he would find himself playing games Zampella worked on for hours into the night, even when he was busy trying to make his own games. "<em>Proof of how compelling and inspiring his work truly was</em>."</p>



<p>Alex Frostwolf, a community lead on <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">the upcoming multiplayer title Highguard</a>, who previously worked on Apex Legends and Overwatch, <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2003222453066039663">added</a>, "<em>While most knew him as the co-creator of Call of Duty and head of Respawn, I had the great fortune of also witnessing his particular brand of leadership, which often included standing up for what he believed in over politics, and protecting his people. The embodiment of a legend if I ever saw one. The industry has suffered a deep loss with this tragedy. My love and sympathy go out to his family. Thank you for everything, Vince</em>."</p>



<p>These are just a handful of messages that have been shared since the news of Zampella's passing was made public. It's clear that his loss is one the video game industry will not wholly recover from, and that the industry is now worse off without him in it. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Squadron 42 Is 40+ Hours Long, Will Launch in 2026’, Confirms Chris Roberts]]></title>

            <guid>1391230</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Chris Roberts</strong>, the video game designer known for the Wing Commander series and most recently for <strong>Star Citizen</strong>, penned his usual end-of-the-year <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Letter From the Chairman'</a> to the SC community, including a few updates on <strong>Squadron 42</strong>.</p>



<p>The single player campaign was initially supposed to launch its beta in <strong>Q2 2020</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-beta-delayed-by-three-months-now-targeting-q3-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then in <strong>Q3 2020</strong></a>, before being delayed indefinitely, with Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-will-be-done-when-its-done-says-chris-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting in October 2020</a> that the game would be 'done when it's done'. </p>



<p>The tune finally changed in October 2023, when developer Cloud Imperium Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Squadron 42 was now <strong>feature-complete</strong> and would enter its polishing phase. A year later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the new target release window: <strong>2026</strong>. However, a few months ago, the game's Content Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that delays could still happen.</p>



<p>Today, though, Chris Roberts has reiterated that Squadron 42 is on the right path toward the Beta milestone and the eventual launch at some point next year. According to Roberts, the game will take <strong>over forty hours</strong> to complete. The game designer also teased that the content quality is something he's proud of, from writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his previous statement</a> about hoping to attract a GTA 6-like attention, Roberts has now said that Cloud Imperium Games isn't planning a long marketing campaign. Because of this decision, fans should expect to learn more about the game relatively close to its actual debut compared to most triple-A games.</p>



<p>The plot of Squaron 42 will see the player character in the role of a rookie pilot joining the celebrated 42nd Squadron, a naval combat unit deployed aboard the massive capital ship UEES Stanton, assigned to the 5th Fleet, 87th Battlegroup in the Odin system, during the Events of Vega II in 2945. The story is framed as a military war narrative centered on the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy, where the player is thrown into a hazardous campaign to combat a sinister pirate threat and the alien Vanduul.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games recruited <strong>major Hollywood talents</strong>, including <strong>Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Gillian Anderson, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham, John Rhys-Davies, Henry Cavill, and Ben Mendelsohn</strong>, to play the role of key non-player characters in the game. Cloud Imperium used new 4D technology to create digital replicas of these actors (as well as player characters and other NPCs) thanks to a unique partnership with the Hollywood VFX company <a href="https://www.clearanglestudios.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clear Angle Studios</a>.</p>



<p>In the 'Letter From The Chairman', Roberts also boasted that Star Citizen received many big updates this year, driving record engagement with the game up to <strong>64 million hours</strong> (last year, CIG registered 48 million hours of playtime) played in 2025. Looking ahead, the Dynamic Server Meshing technology will evolve to reconfigure in real-time, aiming to support thousands of players in a single shared instance; a next-generation planetary tech will debut, offering significantly higher graphical fidelity, denser biomes, and natural ecosystems; a new AI population management system will create more complex and appropriate NPC interactions; and significant improvements are also coming to systems like Inventory, Insurance, and Cross-Patch Persistence.</p>
