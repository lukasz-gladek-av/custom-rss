			<p>During yesterday's State of Play, Bandai Namco shared a new Code Vein II trailer that unveiled the game's release date. The sequel to 2019's Soulslike action RPG will release on January 30, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $69.99, the Deluxe Edition priced at $89.99 (including 3-day early access, the Mask of Idris expansion DLC coming in January 2027, and a Custom Outfit Pack with three costume sets and one weapon), and the Ultimate Edition priced at $99.99 with all the above plus a digital mini artbook and soundtrack and a Character Costume Set that comes with six costumes based on characters from the original game.</p>



<p>A Collector's Edition is also exclusively available <a href="https://t.co/9GBTiLv45w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Bandai Namco Store</a>. Priced at $179.99, it gets players all the aforementioned digital bonuses and the following physical goodies:</p>



<ul>
<li>60-page 25x25cm artbook</li>



<li>18cm figurine of character Lou Magmell</li>



<li>Exclusive Steelbook</li>
</ul>



<p>Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. This sequel builds upon the previous installment's foundation to improve in key areas, as outlined in a new gameplay presentation video that you'll find embedded below.</p>



<p>To begin with, the character creation system is much more robust and detailed than in the original, allowing customization of details such as eyes, hair, scars, and even outfits, hats, masks, and accessories. Being a Soulslike, the combat system is of paramount importance. The developers are evolving it by introducing new weapon types and strategies, such as the bayonet weapon, which blends ranged and melee combat and requires ammunition. The game also retains the core mechanic of building up bleed status on enemies to capitalize with jail attacks, but now the jail weapon types vary more, giving players tactical flexibility tailored to their style. The boss fights promise to be more epic thanks to multi-phase battles and more dynamic enemy abilities. </p>



<p>The companion system was also significantly expanded. In Code Vein II, companions not only fight alongside the player but can even be “assimilated” to provide passive buffs and additional powers. Each companion also has unique abilities, such as Lou, the revenant who can control time.</p>



<p>Narratively, the game introduces a stronger focus on time travel, with the protagonist and companions traveling to the past to save the future. The world exploration also sounds more interactive, with map objects that unlock new areas and crafting mechanics involving consumables like flour for creating buffs and healing items.</p>

			<p>During Sony's September State of Play event, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the final launch date for its long-awaited game Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>The open world action/adventure title will be available starting on March 19, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now across all platforms, with the Standard Edition priced $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced $79.99. The latter provides access to some in-game extra cosmetics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kairos Plate Helm</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Gloves</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Boots</li>



<li>Kairos Cloak</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Armor</li>



<li>Balgran Shield</li>



<li>Exclaire Champron</li>



<li>Exclaire Barding</li>



<li>Exclaire Saddle</li>



<li>Exclaire Stirrups</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Deluxe Edition will be available for $10 more and also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deluxe Edition Limited SteelBook</li>



<li>Map of Pywel</li>



<li>Letter from the Developer</li>



<li>Greymane Brooch Pin</li>



<li>3 Character Photo Cards</li>



<li>3 Patches</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Collector's Edition is priced at $279.99 and adds a stunning 17” Diorama as well as a digital Ultimate Pack that gives players a Tormented Soul Bow, Derictus Spear, Sielos Longsword, Shroud Lantern, and Hyperion Horse Tack Set. All Crimson Desert pre-orders also include the Khaled Shield, and all PS5 pre-orders get the exclusive Grotevant Plate Set. This may be all that remains of t<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hat rumor from two years ago about Pearl Abyss partnering with Sony on the game</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the game's pre-orders opening, Pearl Abyss also updated its <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously shared PC system requirements</a>. The minimum specs are exactly the same, but the recommended specs have been greatly reduced from the previous recommendations of Ryzen 7 7700X / i7-13700K CPU and RTX 4070 SUPER / RX 7800 XT GPU to Ryzen 5 5600 / i5-11600K and RTX 2080 / RX 6700 XT, likely as a result of ongoing optimization. The Steam page also now lists the macOS requirements, which we have reported below:</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 15<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics: </strong>M1<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 135 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 26<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M4 Pro<br><strong>Memory: </strong>16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> M3 Pro<br><strong>Storage: </strong>150 GB available space</p>



<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the rather impressive proprietary BlackSpace Engine, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have covered in detail in our GDC 2025 report</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the road is finally in sight for the second triple-A game developed by the studio currently known for the MMORPG Black Desert. Crimson Desert was originally announced pre-COVID at G-Star 2019 and even had a Winter 2021 launch window at some point before <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being delayed indefinitely</a>. Initially, the game was meant to feature some MMO-like elements, but it was revamped into a full-fledged single player action/adventure title, which inevitably required a lot of work. </p>



<p>It won't be long before we judge for ourselves whether the change and the wait were worth it. In the meantime, stay tuned for additional Crimson Desert coverage.</p>
