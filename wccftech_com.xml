			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be comparable to the PlayStation 4 in terms of system specifications, but some of its features allow the system to push past the quality level offered by the previous-generation system.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">IGN</a> about the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay commented on the development of the port, which began in Summer 2023, and some of the challenges the developer had to overcome to get the game running on the system, such as the many changes that had to be done on the engine level due to the system using a different architecture than the x86 architecture upon which the game was built. NVIDIA DLSS was also a key tool in ensuring the game could run as well as possible on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing CDPR to bring the quality to another level, besides their technology scaling well across all platforms.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS is just one of the Nintendo Switch 2 features that allow the system to push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality. According to Tremblay, the biggest problem with previous-generation consoles was the mechanical drive, an issue the next-generation Nintendo console doesn't have. The increased amount of available RAM is another thing that helps the Nintendo Switch 2 push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality, as it allows not only Cyberpunk 2077 to run better on the system, but also to have the Phantom Liberty expansion included in this new version of the game.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is not comparable to the PC version in terms of visuals, and it was never intended to be the goal, CD Projekt Red has ensured it will be a very enjoyable experience tailored to the platform, with a 30 FPS that promises to stick to the target, and a 40 FPS which the CDPR VP of Technology feels that is a good compromise to the standard 60 FPS offered by most modern console games.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 this week, on June 5th.</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign patch has gone live today, introducing changes to the single-player mode, tweaked Relics rewards, and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.01.1 patch, which is a little over 131 MB big on Steam, introduces the promised balance changes for the game's single-player mode, such as the introduction of the Automatic Revival Upon Defeat effect, which revives the Nightfarer once per night boss and an increase in runes gained, which should both make things slightly easier for solo players.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring Nightreign patch also introduces some general balance changes, increasing the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward for reaching Day 3 and the increased probability of obtaining them from purchasing Scenic Flat stones from the Small Jar Bazaar. The patch also addresses a variety of bugs, including some PC-specific bugs like graphics not rendering properly at the low quality setting, and issues with Climb Up actions. You can find the full details about the fixes introduced by the new patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Patch1011">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of FromSoftware's most interesting games by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

			<p>Resident Evil 9 has high chance of being revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest, according to a reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> today, well-known insider Dusk Golem said that, while they cannot 100% confirm it, they are like 95% positive that the next main entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM will be revealed during Summer Game Fest. This assumption is based on the fact that this is the first time behind the scenes that there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings, and the type of activity that is usually a sign that a new Resident Evil game is being announced very soon. Hopefully, the insider is correct, and we will finally see exactly how Resident Evil 9 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a> in a few days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(1/3) Again, not like I can give 100% confirmation, no one's directly told me or the like. But at this point I'm like 95% positive we're on the verge of RE9 being revealed at SGF. This is the first time behind the scenes there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings <a href="https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA">https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA</a></p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468556498153933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(3/3) and I'd say if you're tuning into Summer Game Fest on June 6th hoping that Resident Evil 9 will show up, there's an incredibly high chance you won't be disappointed. I'm getting into hype mode for it myself.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468559148605517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Resident Evil 9 has been in development for quite some time, and the game went through different iterations before becoming the game we will likely be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">next year</a>. Back in 2017, the game started development as an <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-world multiplayer game</a> that was meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, which wasn't doing too well on the market. In 2021, development was rebooted, and most of the original version's concept and features were scrapped, though the final game still retains some elements of the premise and Leon as the main protagonist.</p>
<p>This year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest show</a>, where Resident Evil 9 has a high chance of making an appearance, airs&nbsp;later this week on June 6th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-launches-new-website-starts-hiring-for-unannounced-action-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and The Evil Within series development studio Tango Gameworks launched its new website today to celebrate the studio's rebranding and the start of hiring for its next unannounced project.</p>
<p>The studio's new website, which can be reached <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, features the studio's new logo, representing the beginning of a new era for the developer and the studio's vision as a "creative workshop." As mentioned above, the studio now also has several open positions for the development of an unannounced action game that will likely be the sequel to the popular Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks was originally shut down<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"> last year</a>, together with Arkane Austin and a few other studios. While the closure of the developer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/">Redfall</a> didn't exactly come as a shock, considering how the game failed to deliver on all fronts, the closure of the Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within development studio was way more surprising, considering the success of their action game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-seemingly-had-at-least-one-unannounced-title-in-the-works-ex-programmer-resume-mentions/">the unannounced projects</a> that were seemingly in the works. Thankfully, the Japanese Studio didn't stay disbanded for long, as it was acquired by Krafton, PUBG's publisher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/">last August</a>, alongside the intellectual property of the popular action game. The other franchises developed by the studio, The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo, are still owned by Microsoft, so it may be a long time before we see new entries in the series, if ever.</p>
