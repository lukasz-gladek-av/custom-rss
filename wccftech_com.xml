			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has announced Black Myth: Zhong Kui, the next game in its Black Myth series, coming to PC and "<em>mainstream console platforms"</em> sometime in the future, as a specific release date was not announced.</p>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui">official website</a>, Game Science makes a few things clear to Black Myth: Wukong fans who potentially have a flurry of questions in their minds about Zhong Kui.</p>

<p>Firstly, Zhong Kui is the next game in Game Science's Black Myth series, but it is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong. As to why Game Science isn't just rushing to show off Black Myth: Wukong 2, in an FAQ for Zhong Kui, it wrote, "<em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio does also confirm that the choice to reveal Zhong Kui first doesn't mean it's the end for Wukong, as it closes by saying, "<em>And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won't end here</em>."</p>



<p>But even though Game Science is debuting Zhong Kui before it shows off Wukong 2, it is also very clear in communicating that this game is very, very early in development. Regarding Zhong Kui's story, Game Science admits that it's "<em>not even done with the outline yet</em>," and also calls the project "<em>little more than an empty folder at this stage</em>." Which it explains is also why the debut trailer isn't gameplay, but instead just a CG short "<em>to let everyone know that a new project has kicked off</em>."</p>



<p>Even though by the sounds of that, we'll be waiting a long time to see any actual gameplay of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, it's exciting to get a look at what the studio is working on, and to know that there's more to come regarding Black Myth: Wukong. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon on when Game Science is ready to release its next project.</p>
