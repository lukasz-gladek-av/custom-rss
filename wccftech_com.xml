			<p>It's only the second week of its open beta, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is already looking like it'll be the game to take over 2025 with how strong its player numbers are on Steam alone. The second week of the beta has already surpassed <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">400K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and now analyst Rhys Elliot of Alinea Analytics is predicting that the game will hit 1 million pre-orders on Steam, after having already hit over 600K. </p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Elliot <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315">shared</a> a few key data points from Alinea Analytics' tracking of Battlefield 6, like how the firm is claiming that the game has already surpassed 605K pre-orders, and that EA stands to make $35 million in pre-sales revenue. </p>

<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">Eurogamer</a>, Elliot elaborated on his predictions for Battlefield 6, saying that he believes it will pass "<em>a million in pre-sales</em>," and that the continued success of the game will be dependent on how EA can carry the momentum the beta is building into launch, and if it can stand out among other major shooters being released close to it, like Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>"<em>As we head into the Autumn period there'll be a lot more going on, but as of right now it's on track to do extremely well: the best Battlefield has ever done</em>,<em>" </em>Elliot said.</p>



<p>That said, Elliot is more realistic than EA executives and believes the target <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">'100 million players'</a> is "<em>completely unrealstic</em>." He's also not in agreement with former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, and doesn't think that EA's comeback with the series will be able to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"><em>boot stomp</em>" Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's important not to conflate Battlefield's pre-launch success - even if it will be a big success - with being a 'CoD Killer'. Yes, Battlefield 6 is making all the right moves with these massive maps, a return to the core classes, the destruction. It is also borrowing a lot of things from CoD. Call of Duty is in a bit of a creative lul and an identity crisis, with Nikki Minaj shooting Beavis and Butthead while Snoop Dogg is twerking in the background. It's weird! But it's still a cultural juggernaut, it has a massive casual audience who buy it on autopilot every year. They complain, but they still buy it, and those habits run deep.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly winning over the hardcore FPS crowd, but CoD has that market momentum, the yearly launches, Warzone is there as that big pool for cross pollination marketing and a funnel into Black Ops. CoD has the seasonal content treadmill it's been running for years and years, with streamer partnerships. Whether Battlefield can keep up with that is unclear</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Battlefield 6 does when it arrives this coming October, but in the meantime you can still check it out this weekend during the remainder of its open beta time. And if you're on PC and having issues getting the beta to launch due to Secure Boot errors, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">check out our guide on how to enable Secure Boot on your PC</a>.</p>
