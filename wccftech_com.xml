			<p>The current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles is now more than five years old, making it well past the time we would start hearing about what the next generation of consoles will look like. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">seen several rumours</a> on what the next-generation Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">hardware will include</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">on top of comments</a> from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, a picture of Xbox's next console is starting to form. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Windows Central</a> seems to piece it together a bit more clearly, framing the next Microsoft console as a best of both worlds between the PC and console experience.</p>



<p>The report leans both on comments from Microsoft executives like Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer and sources who spoke to Windows Central, so understand that nothing about this is finalized, but it does paint a picture that makes sense as to what the next console from Microsoft will look like.</p>



<p>Both Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond have alluded to the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds</a> as a peek at Microsoft's thinking for its next generation of hardware, with the Xbox Play Anywhere becoming more of the focus with all Xbox games being playable on the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles moving forward.</p>



<p>According to Windows Central's report, what those allusions mean is that the next-generation Xbox console will provide a console experience with its UI and the ability to natively play console games, though its foundation will be that of "<em>a curated Windows gaming PC</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, you'll be able to access your Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and Battle.net games just like you're able to on a PC, with the Xbox Full-Screen Experience that's currently live on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Ally handhelds acting as the home base for the device. On top of all those libraries, you'll also be able to access and play all the games currently playable on your Xbox Series X/S consoles, including original Xbox titles, Xbox 360 games, and your full catalogue of backwards compatible titles already available on Series X/S.</p>



<p>Another part of what'll make this device a 'best of both worlds' between console and PC is that the paywall for playing online multiplayer games will be removed for the next generation. Since the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 days, console players have had to pay for the ability to play multiplayer games online, whereas that has never been the case for PC players. That paywall will finally be removed with Microsoft's next console, according to this report, to further align itself with the PC gaming experience this new device is allegedly trying to provide.</p>



<p>Of course, this will also come with more changes to the structure of Microsoft's Game Pass service, though those details aren't clear, and likely won't be until we're much closer to the actual release of next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It's an interesting proposal, to say the least, that we'll finally see a combination of PC perks like having access to multiple gaming libraries and not having to pay for online multiplayer on top of the ease-of-use that consoles provide. If Microsoft can execute on it all, that is.</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several months of rumors</a> about a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, the game that started one of Xbox's most successful franchises, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Interactive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Halo: Campaign Evolved during this year's Halo World Championship event. The remake, powered by Unreal Engine 5 visuals (with the original game's code running beneath), will be released next year on PC, Xbox Series S and X, and even PlayStation 5 for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>As with all remakes, some fans immediately started dissecting the gameplay footage to see what was changed from the original. Even more interesting, though, is the point of view of one of the original developers, Jaime Griesemer, who was a designer on the first three Halo games. <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on X</a>, he criticized some level design changes from Halo: Combat Evolved and eventually likened the remake to the dance remix of a classic song that goes straight to the chorus.</p>



<p><em>You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way, it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.</em></p>



<p><em>Yes, everybody, I know you can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult, but not impossible. You’re welcome!</em></p>



<p><em>On further analysis, I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage, and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore. It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.</em></p>



<p>His perspective isn't shared by one of the co-creators of the Halo franchise, Marcus Lehto (who was recently in the news because he criticized Electronic Arts for not crediting all of his team at Ridgeline Games in Battlefield 6). Lehto was at the Halo World Championship and, <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, relayed a very positive first impression:</p>



<p><em>My honest impression of seeing the new Halo: Campaign Evolved is this:</em></p>



<p><em>I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo: Combat Evolved like this.</em></p>
