            <h2>20th February</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, Victoria knows something her husband doesn't; Tom endures the perennial terror known as entertaining a child over half-term; Bertie realises he's missed something important again; and Will makes mech combat somehow sound rather fun.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Far Cry 4, Xbox Series X</h2>

<p>Last Friday night, I made a bet with my husband that I could start and finish a game well before he was ready to watch the last few episodes of Better Call Saul. He smirked and said fine, but it couldn't be a mobile game like Wordle or something similar. "No problem," I replied, for I knew something he didn't - I knew about the secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> ending.</p><p>As my husband went upstairs to close down his work computer and get into his comfy non-work clothes, I booted up my Series X and settled in to watch Far Cry 4's opening cutscenes up until the point I found myself in front of a plate of monkey heads. Then, once the flamboyant and self-proclaimed King of Kyrat, Pagen Min, had made himself scarce, I prepared myself to do... absolutely nothing. Yes, I set down my controller and waited patiently.</p>
<p>After around 10 minutes (I didn't keep track of the exact time), Pagen Min returned to the dining table - which he had asked me to wait at - and proceeded to take me with him to place the ashes of Ajay Ghale's mother in a shrine within Far Cry 4's fictional Himalayan countryside. Some light button pressing later, to look around and set down/pick up items, I was ready to climb into Pagen Min's helicopter and watch the end credits roll.</p>
<p>20 minutes and I was done. A further five minutes later, my husband showed up. I was smug.</p>

<p>It's a school half-term holiday down this way, which means my son has been up late playing games. While he insists on playing EA Sports FC 26 on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, which I hate because of the sluggish frame rate in comparison to the other console versions, we have also played some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> which is brilliant.</p><p>Nintendo's Switch 2 kart racer feels so great to play, the world is so colourful and alive, and the variety in locations is superb. This game always had a tough task following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, a game that I and millions of others had played to death over years. There are few games I have ever become so familiar with, so change was also going to be tricky. Some eight-ish months since the Switch 2 launched, I'm starting to get some of that familiarity, and I'm able to enjoy the game more easily.</p>

<h2>Overwatch, PC</h2>
<p>It just occurred to me that you can't choose from all of the characters in Stadium. I've been playing for a week but somehow haven't noticed. Stadium is the newish game mode where you can customise your character between rounds by buying ability buffs, or ability tweaks. Example: you can change Mei's ice block ability into an ice boulder that rolls around and she can hurt people with, which is great, so you see that you can quite significantly change a character's behaviour over the course of a game. I wish there were more characters available here, especially the newer ones, but it's still exciting to alter characters I thought I knew so well. I'm re-energised, and it's only one small part of the reason why - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">I wrote much more excitedly about Overwatch's sort-of relaunch earlier this week</a>. I'm also looking for people to play with because it's more fun with friends. Hop on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eurogamer">the Eurogamer Discord</a> and say hey if you fancy it.</p>

<p>So it's me, Pontoon, Guano and Flapjack right? They're all newbies; the planet government has hired me to hold their hands while we level an "undefended" pirate base. They said that the bad guys were running bootleg holotapes out of it - I don't care, it was meant to be an easy paycheck. Just keep an eye on the other three and make sure their BattleMechs don't trip and fall off a cliff while they're shooting the place up.</p><p>Of course, the intel was wrong. By the time we'd got eyes on the base, sensors showed four heat signatures out there in the fog. I told them to get into the woods nearby quick-quick, and two of the stick jockeys managed to do it in time. Flapjack wasn't having it, though. He got so damn gung-ho he ran up to the base to take them all on.</p>
<p>He even got a few shots off against the tiny Locust that was out on patrol, but the light Mech was moving too fast to suffer anything more than a few scratches from his wild laser fire. Pontoon and Guano let it rip too, but from further back they couldn't hit it either.</p>
<p>The Locust wasn't the problem though. Flapjack's 45-ton Firestarter was twice its weight and three times as armoured. The problem was the three extra Mechs at the back of the base, brimming with long-range missiles, large lasers and extended-range particle projector cannons. Once Flapjack entered their line of fire, it was over - the first wave of missiles took his legs, and the next slammed mercilessly into the cockpit before he could punch out.</p>
<p>It's a damn shame. I tore up into the base in my 100-ton King Crab, soaking up the rest of the fire as best I could, and the rest of the green pilots made themselves useful in the background. Pontoon even took out a Panther with a lucky autocannon headshot to tip the battle in our favour. All three of us made it back in one piece. But I'm going to spend more on field repairs and ammo resupply than I'll have made on the job.</p>
<p>And that damn kid. I'll never see those oaty treats in the mess the same way again.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<figcaption>The latest mainline Far Cry entry - Far Cry 6 - took players to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>
<figure>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>

            <p>The latest set photos from Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series give us our first look at Martin Bobb-Semple's Zip, as well as Sophie Turner as Lara Croft holding a rather mysterious looking piece of kit.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with tech outlet <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft said this decision "was not taken lightly". It added it was not a reflection of the "talent, dedication, or contributions" of those impacted by the layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>

            <p>It feels weird to buy a peripheral in order to play games you don't own. I'm generally very positive about the Nintendo Classics offered through the Nintendo Switch Online membership (and the classic Mega Drive games). I know I'll lose access if I stop subscribing, but it feels like a reasonable fee to get these on top of other benefits. But, just like I have never bought DLC for a game I don't own, I find the idea of needing to buy a peripheral to play the newly added Virtual Boy games a little hard to swallow.</p>
<p>We've written about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Virtual Boy before on Eurogamer</a>, thanks to Alex feeling rather keen to throw his money away one night, so I won't bog this article down with more on the console other than to say it's such a bizarre creation that it feels rather exciting to get to play it today via the Switch consoles. A kind of portable you can only really play while sitting at a desk that offers a red and black 3D gaming experience via its in-built display, it's not something I ever imagined playing in my own home, yet here we are - and that's neat.</p>

<p>The aforementioned peripheral, then, is needed to create the 3D screen view that the original console offered - there's no way to play these games without the peripheral, which I understand but at the same time wouldn't see the harm in Nintendo offering 2D versions for those with more of a casual interest. An excellent fully modelled Virtual Boy replica (sans controllers) can be bought for £67, and if you'd rather not spend that much you can opt for a cardboard device of an original design for £17. Would I pay £67 for some plastic that becomes completely useless the moment I no longer subscribe to Switch Online + Expansion Pack? I don't think I would.</p><p>Would I fairly happily hand over £80 for the peripheral and all the games? That's a sweeter deal, and one I feel the hardcore audience interested in this out-there slice of Nintendo history would much prefer. Ultimately, for a retro collection like this an option to own every game on a single Switch cart would be the best scenario, and no doubt some would be willing to stump up the extra cost that would incur. Given Nintendo is planning to release two Virtual Boy games that were never on the original hardware, there's a real collector's angle to this project that doesn't feel fully realised via the way it's being distributed at the moment.</p>

<figcaption>This is what the original hardware looks like, and the peripheral is a great copy just without the controller.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a bizarre thing to say on a website that reviews video games (calm down those of you at the back in the comments), but the quality of the games on offer for the Virtual Boy doesn't really matter. This is as much a piece of history as it is a form of entertainment, so had every game here been a complete stinker I'd have still argued that they are worth experiencing - but gladly there are some that deserve to be played for more than curiosity's sake.</p><p>Virtual Boy Wario Land comes with the reputation of being the best game on the system, and based on the seven games available right now I can't disagree. It's a tight side-scrolling platformer with the classic Nintendo feel that makes good use of the depth offered by the 3D visuals. While I reckon it would work fine in 2D (honestly, most of these games would be absolutely playable), the effects, as basic as they are, still manage to add a surprising amount of visual flair. It's got a banging soundtrack, too, which for some reason I wasn't expecting.</p>
<p>Of the other six available games, I've spent most time with Galactic Pinball, but I'm not sure if this is because it's a great game or if I just find the stationary pinball table easier on my eyes. I say "most time" but I should note here that the 'console' encourages you to take breaks pretty often, and I recommend it. I played Red Alarm (a wireframe graphics 3D futuristic aircraft shooter that is decent if rather odd to experience in the year 2026) for about 30 minutes, and returning to the real world was akin to when Neo got unplugged in The Matrix, but he also had a crooked neck because he had been forced into a completely ridiculous body position.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's really only Wario and Pinball that I've had the drive to dive back into, knowing that I'd come out the other side a little worse for wear. As I said, this whole Virtual Boy project for Switch is worth it for the time capsule experience (even more so in the UK where the console didn't hit stores), and no matter my issues with the way it's been released it's still a lot cheaper than buying a second-hand system and the games. The games yet to release seem more appealing to me, including Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, and the never released F-Zero racer Zero Racers, but we've got to wait a little for those to land.</p><p>All in all, I'm glad Nintendo has brought the Virtual Boy to Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, but it's not without its problems. From technical and practical points of view, the machine is uncomfortable, I had some problems seeing the whole display which forced me to reduce the game view size (although other people who tested it haven't had such issues), and I'm not in love with how you slot the Switch into the hard plastic peripheral - nothing bad has happened yet, but it feels like scratches could happen pretty easily.</p>
<p>I think you know if the cost of the Virtual Boy experience on Switch is something you're happy to pay. I kind of love the whole thing despite itself, which isn't so much giving the system and its lineup and free pass, but an acknowledgement of Nintendo's willingness to try something different. And I still can't help but feel happy this exists at all.</p>

            <p>Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy, and this year is no exception. One thing that does make this February's Pokémon Presents a little different, though, is that this year marks 30 years since Red and Green made their debut.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has been confirmed to air next week, on Friday 27th February at 2pm UK time. For those Pikachu fans across the pond, that's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.</p>
<p>As to what we can expect, well earlier today the company announced that the remakes of those classic Pokémon Game Boy games from 1996 will arrive on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 27th February. FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version - as these remakes are known in their Game Boy Advance versions - will be available exclusively to buy and download on Pokémon Day, once the broadcast has come to a close.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser trailer for the Switch editions of Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version below. Or, if you are keen, you can pre-order these games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-FireRed-Version-3031207.html">via the Nintendo eShop</a>, where <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">they retail for £16.99</a>. </p>

<p>There's also the chance we will see more from Pokémon Pokopia, which is due to be released next month, on 5th March. Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing, and our Alex is already rather taken with the upcoming release.</p><p>"Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">Eurogamer's Pokémon Pokopia preview</a>. " I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition."</p>
<p>We will also probably hear about some updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon Unite and Pokémon EX Masters. Perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-pokemon-theme-park-is-opening-next-february-and-pikachus-popping-up-in-an-electric-pokemon-ride">something to do with the Pokémon park in Japan</a>? Our Lottie, though, is hopeful we will hear something about Gen 10.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see next week?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, the challenging Team Ninja samurai action game, has passed one million copies sold in two weeks. According to the game's publisher Koei Tecmo, this makes it the fastest selling entry in the series' history.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">In a post</a> made to celebrate the occasion, it was also revealed that the entire series has sold over 10m copies too. In a message to fans and supporters the developers stated they "are truly grateful to players around the world for their incredible support."</p>
<p>An accolades trailer was also released to coincide with the announcement, which features multiple review scores, quotes, and gameplay footage of Nioh 3. You can watch it yourself below.</p>

It also fixed the friend searching mechanic, which stopped working after a while. All in all, the game is in a decent state now with its rougher edges smoothed off.</p><p>If you've not picked up Nioh 3 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Dom Peppiatt wrote: "Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights."</p>

            <p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", Sony has decided to shut the studio down.</p>
<p>Last night, it was revealed that Bluepoint - the studio behind the widely praised Demon's Souls remake and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection">Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection</a>, to name just two  - was being shut down by PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint">Bloomberg</a>, around 70 employees will be impacted by the studio's shock closure, which will come into force in March. A spokesperson told the publication the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5. Since then, Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the beloved and exceptionally talented studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>.</p>
<p>A reported response to Bluepoint's closure by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/">Sony exec Herman Hulst said</a>: "As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> launched to critical and commercial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB The Show continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>"To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March."</p><p>Hulst said this decision "was not made lightly", before rubbing more salt on the wound by calling Bluepoint "an incredibly talented team" whose "technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community". Hulst closed by stating he knew this news would come as a blow, but he is "confident" in the "direction" PlayStation is heading.</p>
<p>"Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead," he said. "Thank you for your hard work and continued support."</p>
<p>Personally, I find the closure of Bluepoint absolutely devastating, and a real loss for the gaming industry. Sony's decision to put a studio renowned for its acclaimed remakes on a live-service project raised many an eyebrow, not just mine, with more than just a handful of fans hoping the company would use Bluepoint Games to revive other classic games from within the PlayStation library, namely PS4's Bloodborne. Putting the studio on a live-service project felt like a waste of talent, and a clear misdirection for the team's strengths.</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects including Bluepoint's God of War game cancelled.</p>
<p>Most prominently in recent years, Sony closed Firewalk Studios after its failed launch of live-service shooter Concord in 2024. Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">ceased work on its live-service The Last of Us multiplayer back in 2023</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a> in 2024. In March of that same year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>

            <p>
God of War actor Christopher Judge, the rumbling voice behind beardy Kratos, has suggested more news on the series' future could arrive "late summer".
</p>
<p>
Judge shared the information during a signing session at Canada's Fan Expo, where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM">words were captured</a> (it's unclear if was aware he was being recorded) by streamer Fuzhpuzy. In the video, Judge confirmed he won't be lending his vocal talents to Sony Santa Monica's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently announced God of War Greek trilogy remakes</a> - Kratos actor TC Carson will return for those, he claimed - but he did tease other news is coming.
</p>
<p>
According to Judge, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kratos-is-now-played-by-stargate-sg-1s-christopher-judge">voiced Kratos since 2018's God of War</a>, fans will "be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer", suggesting Sony Santa Monica might be ready to unveil a follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> later this year. That, though, is far from a certainty, and it's possible Judge is working  with the studio in another capacity.
</p>
<p>
As yet, the most substantial hint toward Sony Santa Monica's next project emerged last year, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier teased</a> the studio's "next big thing" - headed up by long-time God of War director and producer Cory Balrog - won't be a new IP, but "might feel like one".
</p><p>
"Maybe that's why people are confused," Schreier wrote in response to rumours surrounding the studio's next project. "Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum." He also noted "the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."
</p>
<p>
Could this be a radical reinvention of the God of War series or something else entirely? If Judge is correct, perhaps we'll learn more later this year. And what about Sony Santa Monica's "new IP", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">hinted at by a developer</a> last August? Mysteries upon mysteries! But until more is revealed, there's always Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently released spin-off Sons of Sparta</a> to sate your God of War needs. And don't forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">there's a TV show on the way</a> too.

            <p>If you're excited for Resident Evil: Requiem, you may want to stay clear of social media for a while, as leaks about the game's ending are popping up online.</p>
<p>Capcom is trying to curb the problem, taking down early spoilers for the survival horror release, but it's proving to be a struggle. On the Resident Evil Requiem Reddit, posts about the leak are being shared and discussed widely. This includes full story breakdowns, specific conversations around certain characters, and gameplay discussion. Steer clear!</p>
<p>This comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-early-copies-of-resident-evil-requiem-appear-in-the-wild-fans-warn-that-now-is-the-time-to-log-off-in-order-to-avoid-leaks">physical versions of the game were obtained early by some members of the public</a> earlier this week. The moment this happened, the clock started ticking towards a wave of unfettered story details spreading across the internet. Almost like some kind of virus. Umbrella would be proud.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, a continuation of the main-line story and Leon Kennedy's arc through the legendary horror franchise, sees him return to Racoon City to uncover some mystery still lurking in that ruined city. Grace, a new character to the series, also plays a key role as the game's second protagonist. All this was known about already from trailers and official releases. Take that and hide away from anything else!</p><p>If you want to get an idea of what the game is like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer previewed it earlier this year</a>. In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the 27th February, to the PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <p>
If you're anything like me, the second Nintendo announced it'd be giving select Switch 1 titles a fancy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> makeover, you probably immediately starting compiling a wish list. The Xenoblade series was high on mine, but remained persistently unloved. Until now that is! Out of nowhere, Nintendo just released an upgrade for last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition - and better still, it's available now.
</p>
<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, follows similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some have been free, some (namely the ones with a bunch of additional content) have had a heftier price tag, while some updates have arrived with a nominal fee.

<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition falls into the latter camp, and owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the new Switch 2 Edition for £4.19/$4.99 USD. And what does that get you? According to Nintendo, 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. It doesn't sound like anything else is included, so you might well wonder why Nintendo hasn't followed previous form and provided this zero-content update for free (probably, money?).
</p><p>
Regardless, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-3026104.html">available on the eShop right now</a>, both as an upgrade and a full game. However, a physical Switch 2 edition is set to launch on 16th April, if you prefer your games small, red, and solid.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Now do Xenoblade Chronicles 2 next Nintendo, please.

            <section><p>Styx: Blades of Greed isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz, but it's easily the best stealth game in years - and so utterly compelling you'll be desperate to get back to it when you have to do boring un-murdery things like, I dunno, going to the shops, or feeding the cat.</p></section>
<p>Boy am I glad to see Styx again. Not because I felt any great yearning to return to the murky, Temu-Warhammer dark fantasy setting of long-forgotten RPG Of Orcs and Men, you understand. But because Blades of Greed represents an ever dwindling chunk of ore from that once rich seam of B-tier games that are just bloody good at what they do. The zenith of the "shorter games with worse graphics" category that people on Bluesky claim to want (and rarely seem to actively seek out, alas).</p>

<p>But don't let the lack of a studio-shuttering budget colour your expectations: Styx 3 is marvellous on almost every front. Picking up literally minutes after the cliffhanger ending of his last outing, 2017's Shards of Darkness, this latest installment throws a dash of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> into the pot, with the eponymous goblin assembling a crew of fellow outlaws, fugitives, and misfits on board a floating ship of thieves. The goal? Collect shards of quartz, a mysterious magical ore that is a crucial energy source for the evil human empire and its Inquisition, a ruthless wizard gestapo intent on eradicating the non-human races and generally not being that nice to humans either.</p>
<p>Stealing shards of quartz from all over the continent disrupts human operations and keeps the stuff out of Inquisition hands, but most importantly, it's a convenient device for weaving RPG-lite character progression into the narrative. Styx is effectively a drug addict, always laser-focused on getting his next hit of quartz, as absorbing it grants him magical abilities. These quartz-derived abilities, along with your innate goblin talents and a set of Batman gadgets are managed via skill trees. It's similar to the way a motivating heroin addiction makes you really good at pinching car radios.</p>

<p>And it's a good core analogy for the entire thing: in a world-building sense, the Styx story is about a ravenous, ruinous empire addicted to conquest. In a meta sense, the game itself is astoundingly compelling: a Pringles can of objectives to methodically sneak, stab, and steal your way through that is more moreish than the Iberian peninsula.</p><p>It's a curious structure for a game with grand, open-world ambitions. Proudly touted as a true Metroidvania, Styx 3 is set across three vast and beautifully distinct murder playgrounds over which the all-important quartz shards are scattered. The Wall is your main stomping ground: a location previously depicted in Of Orcs and Men, which divides the continent between the realms of those races and is a sort of big, dirty hybrid of Hadrian's Wall, the old London Bridge, and the Burj Khalifa: a staggering, labyrinthine tangle of building regs violations, medieval bustle, and impossible verticality.</p>
<p>The second major location is Turquoise Dawn, a tangled alien jungle in which rests a fusion of Orcish tree city and wood-fashioned Imperial outpost: a feast for the eyes, and not at all similar to The Wall aesthetically or structurally, where you're much more likely to die from misadventure or bug attack. Lastly, the ruined tower of Akenash: the entire setting of the first Styx game, reimagined as a warped apocalypse zone full of magical abominations and roving bands of Dark Elves on the hunt for relics.</p>

<p>Akenash is especially interesting if you remember 2014's Styx: Master of Shadows, which I reviewed way back when and revisited a few weeks back in anticipation of this release. It's a fine example of a particularly marvellous thing that only video game sequels can do: the chance to explore an old stomping ground in a new context, warped by time (or magical disaster). The Akenash in Blades of Greed is recognisably a post-disaster remix of the original levels, now presented from angles previously unavailable via a series of floating islands and Styx's array of unlockable traversal options that are metered out over the course of the game's story and provide the Metroidvania part of this delicious genre cocktail.Batman's grapple, Link's glider, Corvo's blink… a bit of everything is borrowed to give Styx an expanding set of tools for accessing ever grander parts of each map, unfolding beautifully like an origami chicken in a deft example of measured, finely tuned pacing.</p><p>A set number of quartz shards must be collected to advance from each act to the next. This takes something that would be a side-objective in, say, a recent Assassin's Creed game and puts it front and centre: this is not a game about icon janitoring, but a tightly focused to-do list with an extraordinary amount of freedom in how you go about it. Over the course of the game I've stumbled across numerous alternate ways to get past particular obstacles. Many areas can be skipped entirely if you care to explore off the beaten path and make regular use of your "amber vision" (a detective mode dependent on amber, a liquid macguffin from the first game that is also a type of drug; Styx is a massive junkie).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>NACON/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are five story acts in total, separated by linear, setpiece stages designed to tutorialise whatever new traversal gimmick you've just unlocked while allowing the game to showcase unique, one-shot areas as postcards of the wider world. This is, mercifully, not a full-on open world pivot for the series but its instanced, linear approach to widening and narrowing the scope at key intervals keeps things interesting, as well as making the world just feel larger than a true open world ever really manages.</p>
<p>What isn't as successful are the cutscenes. Necessary for plot transport, sure, but often comically naff: partly for annoying technical reasons that have plagued the Unreal engine since the Xbox 360 days to varying degrees, but mostly because the voice acting is about 50 percent wretched. Most of the line delivery is functional but lacking any sort of charisma or flair, like the performer would have the exact same inflection reading the shipping forecast. A good deal of it is simply dreadful, as horridly miscast and clumsily delivered as the average school play. Add to this the Unreal-ness of it all, that engine's particular difficulty with camera cuts (why are you redrawing the entire scene from scratch every time we change angles? Why?!), audio cues that ping in entirely the wrong places, and various other minor annoyances.</p>



<p>Luckily, the cutscenes don't form a high percentage of the experience, this isn't Metal Gear after all. In pure gameplay terms, Blades of Greed absolutely sings. Its traversal is a rush to the senses, a game where you cover large distances with death-defying stunts and acrobatic feats like impossible ledge-grabs and riding vortex-like air currents half way to the skybox and back. And then, slinking around the small spaces, ducking under tables, scampering up walls, slithering through drains, grabbing any and all of the burgeoning opportunities on offer to position yourself for the kill, or the snatch. The array of magical abilities on Styx's cheat sheet certainly make things fun, often inspiring the intense dopamine hit that comes when a game convinces you that you've gotten one over on the baddies. The rush of having planned and executed the perfect crime: a loosened chandelier here, a distraction there, a mind-controlled armoured guard puppeteered into plunging to his doom, why not? It's only amber.</p><p>And yet some of the most thrilling time you'll have with Styx is when you <em>don't </em>have the amber to spare. When you can't just Derren Brown your way around a problem. When you can't vomit up a clone to go and pull the lever while you stay in the rafters. Resources are scarce enough that on plenty of occasions, you are simply unable to deploy gadgets or special talents and must solve the current puzzle of getting past some guards in a room by utilising the very basic tools that you had before you even booted the game up: hiding, observing, patience, and timing. Every scrape can be survived and every puzzle can be solved with just these fundamentals, and every blunder into open conflict will get you killed. This is what makes Styx 3 a true stealth game, a proper stealth game, as distinct from the franchise bloat that has, for example, made Assassin's Creed into a straight up action RPG where the virtues of silence and shadow are paid a lot of lip service but ultimately are entirely optional.</p>

<p>Not so here. For those of us who frankly prefer all this sneaking around to a straight fight, Blades of Greed is the real deal, and despite a shift in the general direction of a more open world-ish experience it has, whether via creative restraint or the absence of an infinite budget, resisted the urge to load up on empty calories. Like the titular goblin himself, Styx 3 is smart, and lean. But it has also cracked the formula: previous Styx games relied far too much on reusing locations, which often felt stifling, and killed the sense of progress. What Blades of Greed manages to do with its Metroidvania sensibilities is craft a set of locations that you absolutely don't mind revisiting. I'll go further than that: when the set pieces and story cutscenes are done, they are a joy to return to.</p>
<p>And what this leads to is the conclusion that, not only is this the best Styx game by a wide margin, it's also the best stealth game in years. Styx, you horrid, grotty little git, I didn't realise how much I needed you back. Please don't wait a decade next time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report by Epyllion, a gaming industry advisory company headed by venture capitalist and market guru Matthew Ball, has broken down the state of the video game industry, and has published data indicating the medium is losing the war for people's attention to other ventures, including gambling, crypto, and pornography.</p>
<p><a href="https://issuu.com/ballmatthew/docs/gaming2025_vee10?fr=xIAEoAT3_MzMz">The report</a>, a lengthy 164-page presentation which you can (and should) read yourself, dedicates a whole section called "Video Games are losing the attention war in the 'Major Market 8'" to the topic. It starts by comparing pre and post pandemic consumer spending from eight major video game markets - the USA, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, these countries made up over 60 percent of total spending on video games. Post-pandemic, almost all of these regions have seen a drop in gaming population. In the US, 2.5-4 points worth of players stopped playing video games, the Canadian Trade Association found in its latest report that roughly one-in-six players prior to the pandemic have stopped playing.</p>
<p>These decreases in participation have resulted, the report posits, in a drop in spending. In the US, PC and console spend is down eight percent since 2020 / 2021, which comes to roughly $2.3bn. Mobile gaming's US annual growth in terms of spending has largely flattened since 2025, but it's still above 12 percent compared to 2020, and now beats out console spend.</p><p>Total spend across all "Major Market 8" regions on console and PC shrunk by $4.8bn, and mobile is down by $2.3bn, all while five of these eight markets are at all-time highs in terms of total spend. This money is instead going elsewhere, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> for example, which the report states makes up 67 percent of net growth.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of dire-sounding figures, but why is this happening? Where is all this attention and money going? Well, chapter four of the report links this drop to multiple other mediums garnering people's attention. These are social video, creator pornography, AI assistants, crypto and memecoins, prediction markets, online sports betting, and igaming &amp; icasinos.</p>
<p>In just the US consumption of Tiktok is up 39m hours a day compared to pre-COVID figures. In the 2025, American consumers spent roughly $5bn on Onlyfans. Crypto currency too has been siphoning attention and money from video games according to the report. While its first boom happened during the pandemic video game boom, its second rise in popularity among the public happened in 2025 while the video game industry stagnated.</p>
<p>During this 2025 period, AI apps that allowed for "role play, erotica, and art" have soared. The latest tracked statistic for installs for this software came to just under one billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Prediction markets, where users can bet on events that happen in the world, also had a recent boom in popularity. Users placed 1.5m bets a day during Q4 2025. Online Sports Betting is also taking potential users' money. In 2025, US net losses due to sports betting passed $17bn, a 35x increase from 2019 as these sorts of services become normalised, legalised, and integrated into sports in the USA. Despite bans in other countries, international net losses are around $53bn a year.</p><p>iGaming, which include online casinos, are yet another avenue from gambling which the report raises as an alternative path of gamer's money. iGaming is twice the size of the mobile casino game category in terms of growth, and 21 percent of <strong>all</strong> US video game spend. Worldwide, gamers lose $54bn a year in legal iGaming, which accounts for 45 percent of global gaming spending.</p>
<p>The report states: "Video Gaming's post-pandemic problem isn't that players choose to watch TikTok instead of buying a AAA game, or subscribe to Onlyfans instead of buying a PlayStation; it's that on a Friday evening, players are placing a growing share of their time and spend <em>elsewhere</em>."</p>

            <p>Floundering PvP shooter Highguard lives on, as developer Wildlight releases a new content update and assures worried fans that ominous signs like the game's website going offline are "low priority" problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">The new content update</a>, released overnight, adds an airship-featuring base to the game, a lockpick raid tool, and expands what's on sale in the Store. There's an owlbear-like mount there called a Moonbruin, and some Iron Vigil-themed outfits.</p>
<p>The patch arrives amidst growing concern that Highguard is about to shut down - an assumption that follows a bad start for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">resulting in lay-offs at Wildlight</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the game's website suddenly going offline</a>. (It's still offline, by the way.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q286nJoqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>But Wildlight remains outwardly resolute despite these setbacks, insisting in the game's Discord overnight that the website issue is nothing sinister. "Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified," explained Wildlight staff member WL_Coronach (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915/photo/2">screenshotted by CharlieIntel</a>). "Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve."</p>
<p>These comments follow a statement sent to Eurogamer earlier this month, regarding the layoffs, in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildguard said a "core group of developers" would remain to support Highguard</a>, and that the game wasn't about to close.</p>
<p>Highguard's had a hard time ever since closing The Game Awards in December. Despite the prominence of such an announcement and the proximity of a January release date, the game remained almost invisible until release, suggesting there were problems. Then when Highguard did finally arrive - a game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> pedigree - it failed to convince. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">"We were turned into a joke from minute one," former Highguard developers said</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Match of the Day football commentator Guy Mowbray has revealed he gave EA permission to create an AI voice clone of himself in order to assist with some of the more onerous aspects of recording commentary for EA Sports FC.
</p>
<p>
Mowbray shared the news as part of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC feature exploring how EA Sports FC's commentaries are made</a>, explaining that these days, recording or preparing for the game is a "part of my weekly routine", taking up "pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July."
</p>
<p>
"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario," he revealed. "It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity."
</p>
<p>
According to the report, one of the most repetitive elements of the recording process is reading out the name of every player in the game. Each name must be recorded several times, in different intonations, in order to fit within the wider commentary, and EA Sports FC features "more than 20,000 real male and female footballers". As such, EA now uses AI to replicate Mowbray's voice - with his permission - to "help" with this aspect of recording.
</p><p>
"AI has long been part of our development pipeline, from animation to gameplay systems," EA told the BBC in reference to its AI usage, "and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences. But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."
</p>
<p>
Generative AI does, of course, remain hugely controversial given the numerous ethical concerns associated with the technology. And it's proved particularly contentious in the realm of video game voice acting. Last year, US voice actors union SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-relieved-to-have-the-freedom-to-work-again-says-jennifer-hale-as-sag-aftra-strike-ends">ended a lengthy strike</a> after finally securing "safety guardrails" around AI - and one of the union's key requirements was that companies pay actors on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about how voice actors and unions have been fighting back against gaming's use of AI in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">Eurogamer's lengthy report from last year</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has flattened hope for a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> overhaul by stating that the long-awaited update in development "is not Starfield 2.0".</p>
<p>This, to recap, is the update the Starfield community has been speculating about for roughly a year, ever after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-starfield-bethesda-reassures-fans-it-has-exciting-things-planned-for-2025-as-wait-continues-for-news-on-whats-next">Bethesda assured players it had "a lot of exciting things planned"</a>. This was a comment made in the silence following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">the somewhat anticlimactic release of Starfield's major Shattered Space add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">the Kinda Funny podcast</a> yesterday, Howard said: "Obviously we've been working on a lot of Starfield content [...] You've seen it and I can tell everyone we're going to be talking about it really soon. We're moving into a phase where we're ready to talk about Starfield and really show that in the right way and what's coming to the game. We've been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.</p>

"So for expectation-setting, it's the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you're going to love this. It's updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but [in a] sort of meta [way] - using outer space and things in ways that we haven't.</p>
<blockquote><em>"If Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away [...] I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But look, if Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away, or you bounced off it or found it boring in places, I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally."</p>
<p>Podcast host Greg Miller later asked Howard whether the update was imminent, to which Howard replied: "It's soonish. I don't want to spoil the day but it is coming soon." Miller also asked whether the update was a final update for the game, a sort of bow-tying closure, to which Howard said no. "No, we're doing more Starfield stuff coming up - we've been laying that out. It's something we see continuing for a while."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield was released in 2023 to middling reviews</a>, leading to a general sense that it wasn't the post-Skyrim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> homerun Bethesda had hoped to hit. But it still seems to have a healthy audience. In this interview, Howard referred to Starfield as a "Game Pass hours beast". "We have such a big audience on the game," he said.</p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studio's attention has more recently been on Fallout, following the launch of a second TV series that seemed to be received very well. I haven't finished it yet but Alex Donaldson was very positive, writing in an article that: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2 has made me excited for the future of the games - is there anything better a TV tie-in can do?</a>"</p>
<p>As far as game development goes, the majority of Bethesda Game Studios' 500-person workforce (Howard shared this number in the podcast) is concentrating on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the sixth Elder Scrolls game</a>. (Note that BGS fairly openly uses external development partners - outsourcers - so the actual number of people working on its games is likely significantly higher). Howard referenced this new Elder Scrolls game in the podcast as well, explaining that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-majority-of-people-who-made-skyrim-are-still-here-bethesda-boss-on-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-be-more-like-skyrim-or-oblivion-than-starfield">The Elder Scrolls 6 marks a return to a more "classic" style of game for the studio</a> - think Skyrim or Oblivion - rather than the "creative detour" represented by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and Starfield.</p>

            <p>Do you have a sense of deja vu? Because dataminers believe they've discovered more evidence that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> could be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> - a sentence we've already typed out here at Eurogamer in the year 2026.</p>
<p>That's right, we're back on familiar ground following the release of a massive update for Capcom's latest action-RPG this week, in which the Japanese publisher unleashed a flood of new content into the game to tide us all over until the next big DLC drop comes (which we're apparently going to hear more about in the summer). </p>
<p>As part of this big, final update, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">sleuths digging through the game</a>'s newly-updated code think that they have unearthed more evidence that the game has a Switch 2 version in the works (hat tip, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), in the form of a tutorial image depicting Switch 2 local multiplayer. The image was apparently hidden away in the files, and isn't supposed to be seen in any current front-end version of the game, but is nestled neatly in the update files. Uh-oh!
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>An images supposedly data-mined from the newest Monster Hunter Wilds patch. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This follows on from data strings found in the backend of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4, in which a group of Chinese dataminers believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">they found references to a Switch 2 port</a>, including information about wireless multiplayer, graphical presets, and reportedly "300 detailed parameters across four platforms: PS5, PC, Xbox Series, and Switch 2".
</p><p>The latest Wilds update, though, removed these older text strings. The lord giveth, the lord taketh away, it seems. At least we know from these earlier leaks that a potential Switch 2 version of Wilds will contain "a shadow quality preset for the Switch 2's docked 'Graphics Mode' that is higher than the PC's 'Very Low' preset" and that, in docked mode, the "'Graphics Mode' outputs at 1080p". Given the performance issues Wilds has suffered on PC to date, that's pretty impressive. If it works.</p>
<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform: we're even getting Resident Evil Requiem at launch on the handheld, and that runs on the same engine as Monster Hunter Wilds, so... stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>It'll be nice for Monster Hunter Wilds to have <em>a bit of a win</em>: since it launched in February 2025, the game suffered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">under-performing sales with a fall-off post-launch</a>, and even contributed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">a dip in Capcom's share price</a>. Here's hoping that, with a second bite of the apple, Monster Hunter Wilds can rehabilitate its image to some degree.</p>

            <p>Bungie is uploading four tracks from the Marathon official sound track to major music streaming platforms later today, in the build-up to the game's launch on the 5th March.</p>
<p>These tracks are Rhythm of Writhing Constellations, Focused Erasures and Sub-Routine Resets, We Stole a Moon, and Code Race [Extended]. Alongside this announcement, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2024295371095363688">a 20 second snippet of one of the songs was uploaded to X</a>.</p>
<p>The soundtrack, composed by Ryan Lott of Son Lux, has been sprinkled throughout pre-release trailers for the game. It's already garnered attention from fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-there-such-a-bustling-community-around-marathons-soundtrack-when-the-game-isnt-even-out-yet-one-producer-tells-us-why">who have begun making remixes of their own</a> in preparation for the full release.</p>
<p>Marathon,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too"> which is due to host a server slam public test in later February</a>, seems to be well-positioned for its launch. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">soared to the top of Steam's Top Sellers page</a> when pre-orders were made available, and it got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">a new trailer during this month's Sony State of Play</a>. Those picking it up on PlayStation will be able to unlock a selection of PlayStation charms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">though similar cosmetics will be available on PC and Xbox</a>.</p><p>This, after a rough patch of stumbles for the game. Bungie had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">overhaul many aspects of the gameplay</a> following the mixed reception to a previous closed play test, and visually the game came under fire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">after it was discovered plagiarised art assets were present</a> in an earlier version of the game.</p>
<p>Are you excited for the Marathon soundtrack?</p>

            <p>It feels like we've heard a lot about Bethesda's mysterious, upcoming RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6, lately. The publisher has been very tight-lipped about the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-todd-howard-and-team-have-settled-on-a-region-for-the-elder-scrolls-6">which we first started hearing about in 2018</a>, for the past eight years. We once got a title card, and that's about it. It was only recently we started learning more litle nuggets of information about the game after Bethesda's long silence on the project - whether it's how an old designer thought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-could-have-been-like-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">it was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</a>, or how Bethesda boss man <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Todd Howard wishes development "went a little faster"</a>, we've heard more in the past few months than the past few years combined.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint us with this relatively break-neck dripfeed of information, Bethesda director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has given a surprisingly candid interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">KindaFunny</a>. The veteran Bethesda creative gives us a few interesting tidbits, noting that he wishes the team didn't reveal the game so early - not for the first time - and that after a meandering "creative detour" in the form of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, the team is looking back to its classic formula for The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at," Howard said in the interview. "I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."
</p>
<p>If you were dubious about the capabilities of the engine that powered Starfield living up to current-gen expectations, fret not: Howard also noted that Bethesda has been deep in research and development over the past few years, and the resulting Creation Engine 3 is a marked step up from the Creation Engine 2 that powered 2023's divisive space-faring RPG. The Creation Engine 3 will be the bast for "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond." (Let's all agree nobody's to say "Fallout 5" yet.)
</p><p>Finally, if you need a bit of confidence in the team working on The Elder SCrolls 6, Howard teases "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," alongside a wave of new talent in the studio, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The game is still a long way off,</a> though, so don't get too excited about that just yet. Even if some fans think we're going to get some sort of teaser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">sooner, rather than later</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-one-of-the-best-survival-games-ever-just-got-a-free-switch-2-upgrade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Is there a more terrifying sound in video games than the roar of a Reaper Leviathan or the irritated gurgle of a Crashfish as it suddenly torpedoes toward you from shadows unseen? I mean, yes, probably - but that's not the point. Every time I slip the word "horror" into conversations about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, it's usually met with dismissals and frowns. And sure, developer Unknown Worlds' sublime underwater survival adventure isn't <em>technically</em> horror, but I can think of few games capable of instilling such an ominous sense of dread in me, such a suffocating fear of the watery unknown, as this one. And with Subnautica's free <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> update now here, what better time for reminiscences and to make myself unreasonably anxious all over again?</p>
<p>It is, of course, tricky to talk about Subnautica without acknowledging the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-ai-to-brainstorm-ways-to-avoid-paying-earnout-bonus-to-subnautica-2-devs">acrimonious legal battle</a> between Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership (including original Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland) and studio owner Krafton. But even that dark shadow doesn't take away from the fact that Subnautica remains, some eight years after its 1.0 release, one of the best survival games out there. This you'll already know if you've previously made acquaintance with its thalassophobia-inducing rhythms, but for the newcomers among us, some quick scene-setting; things beginning as you, Ryley Robinson - the sole surviving crew member of the starship Aurora - crash into the remote ocean planet of 4546B.</p>

<p>There are signs Subnautica is something a little bit special - that Unknown Worlds has ambitions beyond merely being another (wetter) entry in the overcrowded survival genre - right from the off. Your adventure starts with a wonderfully dramatic set-piece as your tiny escape pod, with you strapped in it, plummets toward 4546B; alarms blaring, fires erupting around you in first-person, and then darkness. And once you regain consciousness and pop open your battered pod's hatch, you get the full visual force of the planet itself - an endless shimmering ocean, stretching toward a horizon only broken by the belching, battered bulk of the half-submerged Aurora. Subnautica is great at doing story, but never in a way that never feels like it's encroaching on your agency. Yes, progress is guided, giving focus to your otherwise fairly open-ended survival adventure, but it's done subtly - Unknown Worlds always taking care to ensure its narrative is borne from a sense of your own exploration and discovery.</p>



<p>As for the survival, it's relatively familiar stuff on a basic level. You'll murder fish for sustenance with your thermoblade, replenish your oxygen once in a while, desalinate seawater to quench your thirst, and scavenge scrap in order to craft and slowly amass new equipment. And that's when things start to get properly interesting. Before long, you'll have a slick, functional underwater base - a place to prepare for expeditions and shelter away from the ocean's deadlier elements - as well as your first submersible, gradually opening 4546B up for further, deeper exploration. And once you escape the crystalline waters of the Safe Shallows, things get stranger, darker, and - I don't care what anyone says - absolutely bloody terrifying.</p><p>You'll explore kelp forests as huge saw-nosed things charge at you through the murk; investigate mysterious underground caverns and squeal at their pouncing, serpentine inhabitants; inch across vast expanses of darkness, punctuated by occasional splashes of bioluminescence and... worse. Subnautica's striking environmental design is wonderfully memorable, fully selling the illusion of a vast underwater world, and it only gets weirder, more oppressive the further you go. You'll meet lumbering pole-legged creatures on distant dunes, aggressive crab squids with eerily translucent forms in gloomier corners, and eventually (although you'll likely hear them long before you see them) come Subnautica's apex predators: the pincer-faced Leviathans - as massively intimidating as they sound.</p>

<p>And as Unknown Worlds slowly nudges you downward, deeper, the light of the surface ebbing completely away, well - I don't mind admitting that was the point, surrounded by the suffocating horror of yawning nothingness, I had to put the controller down for a while. Throughout all this wide-eyed exploratory wonder/terror, Unknown Worlds seeds new discoveries, new story moments and set-pieces, new surprises, all pushing you toward an end point in a way that feels natural and properly satisfying. It's a brilliantly designed, beautifully refined survival adventure (the voice acting and synth-heavy soundtrack are stellar too) and it's one I've been intrigued to revisit even as my Leviathan-ravaged nerves protest the idea.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-and-below-zero-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-announced">Subnautica's new Switch 2 update</a>. It's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/subnautica-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">available right now as a free upgrade</a> for owners of the original Switch release, bringing promise of a boost to visuals, resolution, and performance. Subnautica has always run a bit erratically, even on a decent PC, so expectations were never particularly high when it came to the Switch 1 release; but the compromises of that version give way to something a little smoother and more striking on Switch 2 - even if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3MeZ2Ral2o">early reports suggest</a> it doesn't hit its 60fps target with any real consistency. But still, there's something enormously appealing about returning to Subnautica on a handheld - and not just (but mainly, I admit) because I feel like it'll be considerably less intimidating on a small screen. And when I'm done with that, Subnautica's standalone expansion Below Zero has been given a Switch 2 upgrade too, and I've not played that one at all. To 4546B or not to 4546B, then, that is the question - and I reckon I'm ready to dive back in.</p>

            <p>
An advert released to promote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been banned after the UK's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints that it "trivialised sexual violence" following an investigation.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in a <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/activision-blizzard-uk-ltd-g25-1319083-activision-blizzard-uk-ltd.html">ruling shared on the regulator's website</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-">Game Developer</a>), the advert - which began airing on YouTube and Video on Demand channels last November - focused on an airport security check where two security officers were, according to dialogue, "Off playing the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 7." Standing in for the officers were two "replacers".
</p>
<p>
"A male member of the public was then shown to be passing through the metal detector," the ASA description continues. "A male security officer said, 'You've been randomly selected to be manhandled – face the wall!' and turned the man around. The female security officer was then shown to be licking her teeth while picking up a prescription container and shaking it, before showing it to the male officer who winked back at her.
</p>
<p>
"The male officer then told the man, 'I'm gonna need you to remove your clothes, everything but the shoes.' The woman then put on a pair of gloves and said, 'Time for the puppet show!' A post-credit scene showed the male officer putting a hand-held metal detector in the man's mouth and said, 'Bite down on this, she's going in dry.'" 
</p><p>
The ASA says it received a total of 11 complaints about the advert. Nine believed it "trivialised sexual violence" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and offensive", while two believed the ad "encouraged or condoned drug use" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible".
</p>
<p>
During the ASA's investigation, Activision Blizzard UK told the regulator the advertisement had been reviewed by Clearcast (a non-governmental organisation which pre-approves British TV advertising) which gave it an "ex-kids" timing restriction, meaning it could not be broadcast during or around children's programming or content likely to appeal to under-16s.</p>
<p>Activision also argued the ad "depicted a deliberately implausible, parodic scenario that bore no resemblance to real airport security procedures" and that previous ASA rulings "recognised that ads containing obviously absurd or parodied scenarios reduced the likelihood of being interpreted literally or being viewed as behaviour to emulate."</p>
<p>Addressing complaints of "trivialised sexual violence", the publisher insisted the advert "did not sexualise the act of performing searches and contained no implication that the acts were sexual in nature." It similarly argued the ad did "not depict illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medication."
</p><p>
Despite Activision's assertions, however, the ASA noted that while the advert contained no explicit imagery and while "most viewers would understand the ad was intended to be humorous", the humour was "generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man, an act associated with sexual violence." It also felt that the officers' "confident and joking demeanour presented this [act] in a humorous manner."</p>
<p>"Because the ad alluded to non-consensual penetration, and framed it as an entertaining scenario," the regulator concluded, "we considered that the ad trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive." However, it did not uphold complaints regarding drug use, determining the advert was "unlikely to be understood as encouraging or condoning drug use" and was therefore "not irresponsible on that basis."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the ASA ruled - as a result of the upheld complaints - that the Call of Duty advert "must not appear again in its current form". Activision Blizzard UK was also told to ensure its ads were "socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, for example by trivialising sexual violence". At present, the airport security spot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH1csdj8oMk">viewable as a video on the official Call of Duty channel</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the upcoming entry in Konami's legendary horror series, looks to be a console launch exclusive on the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This stems from <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/townfall/us/en/">the game's official website</a>, on which only three platforms are listed: Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PS5. There's no mention at all of the Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, or older consoles.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-proper-look-at-silent-hill-townfall">recently got a story trailer</a> revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony's State of Play</a>, showcasing the Scottish town of St. Amelia. Developed by Glasgow-based Screen Burn, it follows the tale of SImon Ordell as he navigates the mysterious town with his CRTV, a small electronic device he seems glued to for better or worse.</p>
<p>The game also got a further explanation courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw">a Silent Hill Transmission</a> hosted by Konami on the 12th February. This gave a further look on how the game will work, its mechanics and story, by the developers at Screen Burn.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">The game was first announced back in 2022</a>, and is one of multiple big SIlent Hill projects that have seen the light of day recently. Obviously there was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">was a great release from Bloober Team</a>, but also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">which also stole the hearts of many horror fans</a>.</p>

            <p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">remake of the first Witcher game</a> is seemingly on the back-burner as CD Projekt Red has reportedly added support studio Fool's Theory to the massive development effort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Moreover, there have been recurring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumours of an all-new Witcher 3 DLC</a> made by the same studio. Meanwhile, original lead story designer Artur Ganszyniec has been revisiting Geralt of Rivia's first big RPG adventure, giving longtime fans all-new insights into the game's making.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@artur-ganszyniec">Ganszyniec's YouTube channel</a> already houses his complete playthrough of the game with valuable commentary, so we highly recommend diehards to slowly chew through it if they have the time. That said, the story designer's most shocking revelation (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-mistake-i-think-the-witcher-1s-lead-writer-says-the-story-team-didnt-know-about-its-twist-ending/">VGC</a>) came near the very end, during the 26th and final episode of the series, which you can watch below:</p> <figure>

<p>At the 1:30:22 mark, once the 'artwork cutscene' in line with the rest of the game's ends, he talks about what happened between the story team and the rest of the studio. Apparently, a final CG cutscene (which is part of the game as we all know it) was added without the team knowing it. "That's where we wanted the game to end, with an open question and open future... But while we were finishing the game, someone decided – the board decided or Michał Kiciński (co-founder of CDPR) decided – that we needed an animated outro for the game," Ganszyniec says.</p>
<p>The CG cutscene introduced the idea of Witchers that are hunting down kings, which led directly into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>. "The script for what we're seeing now, this animation, was created not really involving the story team. It was sort of... we weren't really paying attention," the lead story designer adds before elaborating on what the story team's original plans were. "That's why the second Witcher is very political and there's not really room for exploring who Geralt is, his family, his history and stuff like this." If you've played through the entire Geralt trilogy, the shift is obvious, but having more clarity on what went down behind the scenes definitely helps after all these years.</p><p>Regardless, even Ganszyniec concludes he's excited to see how the remake turns out. As for the different route The Witcher 2 took, it could be argued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</a> went back to a more personal story with Geralt and his family at the centre of a high-stakes epic.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Replaced, the highly-anticipated cyberpunk platformer from Sad Cat Studios, has been delayed.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>But while we were once expecting to get our hands on Replaced next month, the developer has decided to delay its release a notch. In a statement, Sad Cat said while Replaced is "technically finished", it feels a few more weeks to get the game fully "polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you" would be beneficial. As such, Replaced will now launch across PC and Xbox Series X/S on 14th April.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highly-anticipated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-gets-demo-and-you-can-play-it-this-week">there is a Replaced demo currently available to try out via Steam</a>. Sad Cat called the response to Replaced's demo thus far "the ultimate fuel" for the development team. "To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible," Sad Cat said in the statement announcing Replaced's delay.</p>
<p>"We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p>
<p>Sad Cat closed by thanking its community for its "patience and support" in the years since Replaced was first unveiled. "Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it," the studio said. "We are super close to the finish line and we can't wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work."</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Replaced has had its release date moved. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay Replaced due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed into 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>.</p><p>I was recently lucky enough to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't always count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview">Eurogamer's Replaced preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite what confused Call of Duty players who changed teams would have you believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is a notable modern military FPS that's doing <em>fine</em> a few months in, usual bumps in the road included. Now, Season 2 has finally arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-until-february-but-more-content-for-season-1-and-events-are-on-the-way">following a delay</a>, and it's kickstarted new positive and negative discussions.</p>
<p>Even though more maps, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-getting-battlefield-4-map-golmud-railway">fan-favourites from past games</a>, are coming this season, the first phase of S2 is all about Contaminated, a sprawling new location that offers different type of engagements, from medium-range to combat in trenches to close-quarters chaos in closed environments. It's an especially good fit for the attack/defence structure of the classic mode Breakthrough, yet it also adds a new mechanic to the game that's giving some players a headache.</p>
<p>As teased in the explosive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLakPdVhEc">gameplay trailer</a> released last week, chemical weapons are a key part of this season's narrative and gameplay. It means Contaminated features huge chemical chaos at certain points (as shown off in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJMlK1rHz0">extensive gameplay videos</a> from prominent figures in the FPS space), as the new map's exterior areas are engulfed in giant gas clouds that force every player to use masks, which make return after being a crucial element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? Some players are having trouble equipping them (whether it's due to messy key binds or bugs) or straight-up dislike the mechanic. On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/">Steam forums</a> for the game, it's common to find posts like "Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?" and "Gas I'm not a fan of. Died too many times putting mask on and off." Meanwhile, others praise the new map and the different rhythm it brings: "Say what you want, but this season/patch is a huge step in the right direction, so I don’t understand all the hate and negative reviews."</p>

<p>It's the usual back-and-forth, really, perhaps exacerbated by the fact Battlefield 6 admittedly leaned a bit too heavily on a CoD-like vibe to onboard more players at launch, which led to much of the player base fighting over whether the game should borrow more from its biggest (and currently defeated) competitor or stick to what made the series special. So far, it looks like EA and Battlefield Studios are doubling down on large-scale warfare that brings it back even closer to the series' roots, but it's not surprising to see it lose part of its launch-months weight as its future comes into focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/">On Reddit</a>, however, the vibes are more positive even if the usual bugs and performance woes that big updates introduce need to be dealt with. "My faith in BF6 has been restored," a veteran said before listing a number of changes that made the game feel better beyond new additions like the aforementioned map and extra weapons. Many joined the chorus, praising the new brand of chaos that Contaminated has brought: "I liked the map... bushes, trenches, bunker... I love it." Some are even more optimistic after just <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022008332488146971?s=20">Phase 1 of S2</a>: "Battlefield Feels Like War Again, And That Is A Very Good Sign," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1r760za/s2_battlefield_feels_like_war_again_and_that_is_a/">thread</a>'s title states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more realistic players are just wondering how long it'll be before the volatile community turns on the devs again: "How long does it take to be back at only hate posts on Reddit?" Immediately, many users suggested it would be a matter of hours or even minutes. Never change, Battlefield veterans. Never change.</p>

            <p>Today, in News I Didn't Expect To Ever Write, I bring to you <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Souji Souai LOVE</a>, a free game by chemical and cosmetics giant Kao Corporation that stars idols, only the idols are cleaning products. As in... their heads are bottles of detergent and other products. Japan once again proves its marketing game is centuries ahead of the rest of the world's.</p>
<p>The shocking news came to our attention via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/finally-an-idolmaster-clone-game-where-the-idols-are-all-detergents-and-cleaning-agents/">Automaton</a>. The site details the game is a 20-minute visual novel-style sim that has players embody a "rookie producer" tasked with making sure the group Shining4's debut performance isn't a failure. In traditional VN fashion, you must get to know each team member better and help them with menial tasks, such as... cleaning toilets (using their heads, I guess).</p>
<p>"It's exactly like one of my wacky animes," you might be thinking, and yeah, you're totally right. Souji Souai LOVE doesn't feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-EFRFk4fA0">little girls transforming into cars after drinking gas</a>, but it's odd enough from the get-go, and its catchy central song goes the extra mile to sell us on Kao's pitch:</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, a decent amount of money, time, and talent went into this marketing stunt, and Japanese social media users are shocked the company even got singer and voice actor Yoshiki Nakajima (The Idolmaster: SideM) and J-pop artist Kent Ito, among others, to voice these characters. "The four idols are Kyukyutto (dish soap), Bath Magiclin (bathtub cleaner), Toilet Magiclin (toilet bowl cleaner), and Quickle Wiper Three-dimensional Wet Sheets (for cleaning floors), all based on real-life products," Automaton's report revealed.</p><p>The game can be played through <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Kao's official homepage</a> and works on PC and mobile. It may not be for everyone, but considering how much time the average Internet user spends every day doomscrolling on social media, this seems like a better use of a fraction of one's daily phone time.</p>

            <p>After showing off a selection of PlayStation-exclusive charms for in-game weapons, the Marathon social media account has indicated that similar charms will be coming to other platforms like PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>This post, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023835955149623660">made in response to a community question on the matter</a>, states:"We'll have weapons charms for Steam and Xbox players as well, which we'll share more about in the future!"</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023819735737967016">The charms shown off</a> for PlayStation players include little weapon cosmetics referencing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. So for PC and console, one wonders what sort of other games will get nods in the form of such attachments.</p>
<p>Things really seem to be ramping up for Marathon. Not only did it take up a big spot during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">the recent Sony State of Play</a>, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Server Slam test</a> happening between the 26th February until the 2nd March. Finally, players will be able to make their own mind up on whether the game is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The game has certainly ran into its fair share of hurdles during development. Initial feedback on previous tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">weren't entirely positive</a>, with many criticising the PvE aspect of the game as well as missing features like proximity voice. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">a massive plagiarism scandal</a>, which required developers to comb through the game to remove elements of work belonging to artist Antireal.</p>
<p>The game's journey to launch is nearly at an end, with the game launching next month on the 5th March. Will you be checking it out? Let us know!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is almost here, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">we're confident it might be a hit</a>, especially after learning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-pokopia-has-minecraft-style-persistent-servers-director-confirms">Minecraft-like persistent servers</a> are part of the game. Now we're just hoping it delivers on all its promise when it launches on 5th March. Wanna get more hyped tho?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's massive interview</a> with key creatives on the game had already given us plenty of interesting tidbits, and the latest (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-boasts-largest-development-team-in-omega-force-history-with-dragon-quest-builder-2s-game-and-art-director-on-board/">Automaton</a>) confirms the project enlisted Omega Force (a Koei Tecmo studio) only after a group of developers saw and was instantly fascinated by Game Freak's original vision for Pokopia.</p>
<p>As reported before, it was game and map designer (now senior director) <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-creator-says-the-idea-came-from-his-rookie-days-placing-grass-on-the-map-at-game-freak/">Shigeru Ohmori's work on Ruby and Sapphire</a> placing grass patches and vegetation that first inspired the idea for a simulator which encouraged player creativity and was all about creating a world for the Pokémon to live in. The concept wouldn't evolve until "more than 20 years" later, when Ohmori delivered a game prototype and promotional video that prompted Game Freak to take the pitch more seriously.</p>
<p>Producer Kanako Murata confirmed to Famitsu that Koei Tecmo was brought in after some of its key <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> creatives saw Ohmori's materials, which "provided such a clear picture of the game's vision" that Omega Force felt they could contribute massively to it alongside Game Freak. The rest is history, and we're about to play the final result soon.</p><p>The new report also highlights the development team and Game Freak worked together "over the course of 3 to 4 months before commencing development in earnest," which apparently didn't take very long either; game director Takuto Edagawa and art director Marina Ayano (DQ Builders 2 veterans) stated "all involved parties" solved the core problems and more unique ideas before entering full development.</p>
<p>A time frame wasn't revealed, but it sounds like Pokémon Pokopia has ultimately been one of those projects where everything comes together nicely and the finish line was never too far away. Will it be the cozy life sim of many fans' dreams? I sure hope so.</p>

            <p>I feel for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. It's a bit like an athlete that goes to an Olympics and makes it to a final but doesn't place. It's a great achievement, a success by many people's standards, but history doesn't care.</p>
<p>And Avowed seemed to be a success when it came out a year ago. It had a bigger moment than I expected it to, than many people expected it to, because there were doubts about Obsidian's fantasy game before it arrived. But when it got here and people played it, we all seemed pleasantly surprised. I wrote almost exactly that in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">my Avowed review</a>: "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," I said. Yet here we are a year on, as the PlayStation 5 version arrives, and we seem to be asking ourselves the same thing: is Avowed worth our time?</p>

<p>I get it. Last year was tough for a role-playing game because there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and it bewitched everyone and gobbled up all the awards. It vacuumed the air out of the room. And even if there wasn't Clair Obscur, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, another big hitter, and there was Oblivion: Remastered and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. There was a lot in or around that RPG space. Even Obsidian, developer of Avowed, released another RPG in The Outer Worlds 2 - there's nothing like tangentially competing with yourself. It meant that 2025 was so busy that when it came time to reflect upon it, Avowed was overlooked - it only just squeaked into our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">'best games of 2025'</a> list.</p><p>It's a shame because we know the game is good, and it's unfair that Avowed, despite success, seems destined for life as an underdog. Though in another way, it helps reframe Avowed in what I think is a more appealing way, because I believe it's a nice example of a modern double-A game - bigger than most, sure, but also with an intentionally limited scope compared to your mega-blockbusters. Avowed isn't quite at the top-end and nor is it anywhere near the bottom. If I'm being really unkind, I'd say it was dated to look at and stiff in animation. But it doesn't matter in a double-A game, because what a double-A game lacks in looks, it usually makes up for in character.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This isn't meant as an insult Avowed in any way. There are plenty of moments where the game is capable of wowing with beauty, particularly environmentally, as you explore its fantasy land that's been seemingly doused in psychedelic-laced Miracle Grow. Exuberantly coloured plants of colossal proportion fight for control of the light, overlapping each other while delightfully framing your view. It's a trippy kind of paradise, and it's a refreshing sight in a marketplace clogged by melancholic grimdark fantasy. And extend that thought a little bit and you get at the game's character itself.</p>
<p>This is a fantasy role-playing game that's admirably clear-headed about what it is. Avowed is escapism and adventure. It is romping and clambering around a paradisiacal island while thumping hordes of baddies and leaping off high ledges into small pools (shout-out to whichever developer hand placed these). The game isn't complicated. There's no convoluted social game to play, very little tactical mastery to employ, and little to slow you down or get in your way. It's a game about doing. There's no genre subversion, no po-faced complex meaning between the lines, no heavy emotional burden. Avowed is a game about the simple pleasures of play.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Xbox Game Studios / Obsidian Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That doesn't mean it's dumb - please don't get that impression. Avowed might not have the dating game that's in, say, Baldur's Gate 3, but that doesn't mean you can't grow close to companions, or that they don't have deep and meaningful storylines. Kai in particular, the fish-faced fellow from the promo images, has a really touching story to tell, and I thought Yatzli, the small furry lady, was hilarious. There's humour here, a lot of it. And while there's no heavy tactical side to the game, there is plenty of theorycrafting in how you mix and match weapons and abilities in freeform combat and customisation. And the realisation of combat, the physicality of it, is tremendous. There's heft and wallop, and when you start combining freezing magic with hammer blows, say, systems converge in wonderfully destructive ways.</p><p>Avowed is a game preoccupied with fun, I think, and with play, perhaps as a game should be. Even exploring the game's world, which is broken into a handful of regions, there's a sense you're exploring purposefully designed playgrounds which are intentionally populated with climbing frames and hidey holes masking subterranean worlds - or eccentric NPCs waiting to regale you with nonsensery. You can almost feel the designer's eyes on you wherever you go, and I enjoy that, I find it reassuring. Adventure seems to be everywhere.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This is a long way of saying don't overlook Avowed again - it deserves more than that, and yes it is absolutely worth your time. And a year has treated the game well. There are new abilities to play with, new races to play as, a new weapon type, a new game plus option, a photo mode, and myriad tweaks and fixes. It's the sort of stuff I'm sore about not being in the game when I played it - not that it will make a fundamental difference, but still, these are the grace notes and flourishes and expanded options I appreciate. In short, Avowed is better than it once was, and it was already better than I think most people give it credit for.</p>
<p>Look, February is a grim month where I live, cold and miserable and dreary, and that's exactly what Avowed is not. This is a much needed dose of gaming sunshine. It's only a shame there aren't more games like it.</p>

            <p>Crimson Desert will be fully voiced by humans, Pearl Abyss's marketing director has assured in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Speaking with John Paul McDaniel (ItmeJP) and his peers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">the Dropped Frames podcast</a>, marketing director Will Power responded to a question on whether all the voices in upcoming open world action RPG Crimson Desert will be voiced by human beings.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to criticize other games, but all of our voices are done by humans," Power stated. "I'm refraining from saying that 100% of the NPCs have human voices [...] because if that's not the case for even one NPC, I don't want the internet to accuse me of lying. But yes, all the main NPCs and those in side quests have actors' voices. The game features voice acting in different languages."</p>
<p>These languages, as of writing, are English, Korean and Chinese according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/">the game's Steam page</a>, however <a href="https://www.sisaweek.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=228580">previous reporting has claimed that other languages are in the works</a>.</p>
<p>This same interview featured Will Power emphasising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crimson-desert-has-no-microtransactions-at-launch-says-pearl-abyss">Crimson Desert was a "premium experience"</a>, with no microtransactions whatsoever unlike its predecessor Black Desert Online. The game's been drumming up a lot of excitement as of late with its 19th March release date soon approaching.</p><p>It's a wild time to be alive when fully human-voice performances are something that stands out as a positive in an industry grappling with generative AI technology. However, given the positive reception to the lack of microtransactions and this, there's clear appetite for a polished game made with human hands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> getting a native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version was one of those no-brainers we expected to see as soon as the console launched, yet it took more than a few months to arrive, and when it finally did, it was a mess. What happened there? It's a game from 2011, for Talos' sake.</p>
<p>If you hadn't been keeping track of the recent situation, the Switch 2 port of Skyrim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E">arrived in December out of nowhere</a> and promising sharper visuals and stronger performance than its Switch 1 counterpart. The first part was true; Skyrim's Anniversary Edition (the most recent version of the game that comes with plenty of Creation Club content) on Switch 2 was lots sharper and more detailed, landing next to the more recent refreshes of the game and even sporting sharper looks than on handheld PCs due to impressive <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-on-switch-2-ps5-level-visuals-marred-by-input-lag">DLSS implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game didn't <em>feel </em>good to play. Note how I'm not saying the performance was bad. Input lag is an entirely different thing, and that was the problem. Veteran players instantly noted the massive issue, and <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-suffers-from-kinect-level-input-lag-on-switch-2">Digital Foundry later confirmed everyone's suspicions</a> the game was suffering from terrible delay between pressing buttons and actions happening.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we also wanted a 60 FPS mode for a 2011 game that was already running amazingly well on the Steam Deck and other handheld PCs, but 30 FPS was fine (Skyrim is not a fast-paced game) in exchange for the sharpest portable version of the game we'd seen so far. But you know, put in the work to make it not feel like <em>shite</em> due to unresponsiveness.</p><p>Last month, a quick patch uncapped the framerate, which helped with the overall input lag but felt like a band-aid fix. Plus, resolution and graphical settings were barely altered, so the game never really hit 60 FPS and thus felt wobbly and unstable, especially when Docked, as Switch 2's VRR screen could mask some of its unevenness. <em>Not quite there.</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Switch 2 port around the corner (24th February), pressure was mounting. How could we be excited for that version of the game when the far simpler Skyrim wasn't running properly? Well, things have changed now, as <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">the just-released 1.2 patch</a> takes a hammer to input lag, stability issues, and overall control awkwardness. More importantly, Performance and Visuals (Quality) modes are now a thing that can be toggled at any time.</p>

</figure>
<p>On paper, the choices are simple: 30 FPS with sharper graphics or 60 FPS with softer visuals due to a lower internal resolution. After spending some time with the game after the patch myself, I can say they work exactly as intended, and even the 30 FPS mode delivers more responsive controls than what we had before. There are bigger differences beyond the resolution cut to hit the sweet 60 FPS line though (see above).</p><p>The most obvious cutback is the one done to object density and LOD details. Like in older versions of the game (or the PC one when you lowered settings), grass draw distance sees the biggest change. When targeting Performance, it'll pop-in a few tens of meters ahead of you, which reminds me of the original versions of the game. Distant details, including NPCs, also feel instantly blurrier, and shadows are chunkier. Moreover, textures are less defined in order to free up resources.</p>
<p>In practice, however, I think most players will agree the game still looks fine and better than its original iterations, and the 60 FPS target is consistently maintained in my experience so far. Whether you play Skyrim in third or first-person, all the aiming and imsim-like interactivity greatly benefits from higher framerates, and going with Performance here feels like the only path forward to me. The 30-FPS Visuals mode is solid now if you can get used to it though, and since these options can be swapped on the fly, I'd recommend it to get the best possible screenshots even if you're going with Performance during normal play.</p>
<p>Overall, Skyrim on Switch 2 finally feels like what we should've gotten back in December, and while there's room for extra improvements and fine-tuning (maybe a Balanced 40 FPS mode for handheld?) in future patches, Bethesda's modern RPG classic is a perfect fit for the system. Bring on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-1-041-final-update-full<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, hope you're ready to sit down and focus on one version of the game for a while, because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> just received patch 1.041 - the last patch until the DLC - and it's a pretty hefty one. Buckle up.</p>
<p>This patch, marking one year of the game since launch, makes some pretty big introductions, most notably finally bringing Arch-Tempered Arkveld into the fray, alongside 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, and a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 (which we know launches on 13th March). 
</p>
<p>
Strap in, the full patch notes are below, and they're pretty hefty. The patch weighs in at about 13GB on PlayStation, 16GB on Xbox, and 15GB on Steam.</p>
<h2>Major Additions and Changes</h2>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.
– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</p>
<p>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added. This side mission will become available after reaching HR 9+.
</p><p>– New side mission "Love for a Hero" has been added. This side mission will become available after completing the extra mission "Ghosts Pay No Heed to Tomorrow" and then talking to Nadia and Mina.</p>
<h3>Bases and Facilities</h3>
<p>– Added a new feature to the Melding Pot that allows you to meld Gogma materials.</p>
<p>– Added a new feature that allows you to earn random ingredients at the Ingredient Center after reaching HR 9.
</p>
<p>– New Appraisal Items called "Timeworn Charms" have been added to quest rewards. (No changes have been made to the attributes of Talismans earned. Chances of receiving Talismans with high rarity are increased when using Timeworn Charms.)</p>
<p>– Increased the maximum number of Pop-Up Camps for the Windward Plains, the Scarlet Forest, and the Oilwell Basin. (This will be unlocked by talking to the Pop-up Camp Meowster or the Support Desk after completing the assignment "Germination".)</p>
<p>– Added an option to the Barrel Bowling results screen that allows you to retry immediately. An option has also been added that allows you to use 10 Barrel Bowling Vouchers and receive all rewards at once.</p>
<p>– Adjusted the parameters of the Blossom Barrel Bombs used in Barrel Bowling to behave differently from the Large Barrel Bombs used out in the field. In accordance with this adjustment, new placement patterns have also been added.</p>
<p>– Reduced the waiting time between throws in Barrel Bowling, so that players can throw the second barrel while the results of the first throw are still being displayed.</p>
<h3>System</h3>
<p>– Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</p>
<p>– Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</p>
<p>– Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</p>
<p>– Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</p>
<p>– Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</p>

</p>
<p>– Ultimate Berserker
</p>
<p>– The Monkey King
</p>
<p>– Sovereign Brute
</p>
<p>– There Goes the Neighborhood
</p>
<p>– Added a new special environment quest. (This quest will become available after completing the existing three special environment quests as well as the 10★ Arch-tempered Arkveld event quest.)
</p>
<p>– When quick-accessing "Quest Last Played" on the top screen at the Quest Counter, the default departure point will now be set to the last departure point used. (If the last departure point used is not available, the player will start from the base camp as usual.)
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the display for event quests to make it clearer that the player is offline on the screens for accepting or joining a quest.
</p>
<p>– Added a Refresh button to the search results list for SOS Flare Quests.
</p>
<p>– Added Thai as a text language. Text language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added Latin American Spanish as a voice language. Voice language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added a "Favorited Items Safeguard" feature to the Start Menu options. This will lock the confirm button for specific facilities so that the player cannot use items that are registered as favorites. (Note: This setting can be changed back to "Require Confirmation" on the same options screen.)
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for checking the details before registering an equipment loadout for shared loadouts on the Invitation List screen.
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for going back and forth between the "Upgrade from Box" screen and "Transcending" screen at the Smithy.
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the UI for when the player approaches a Hunting Assistant (Werner or Gemma) in the field, making it easier to distinguish between the positions of Werner or Gemma and their hunting tools.
</p>
<p>– All nine permanent event quests that were only playable online have been made available for offline play as well. (Please refer to the Event Quest schedule for more details.)
</p>
<p>– Heart of Judecca (Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad)
</p>
<p>– Specter of Their Sins (Gogmazios), etc.
</p>
<p>- All 29 event quests that yield equipment materials and that were only available for a limited time have been made permanent and playable offline. (Please refer to the event quest schedule for more details.)</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue where Fabius could get hit by the player's slinger during Gogmazios's special attack.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue causing some items to disappear temporarily from the Radial Menu when using items like traps and such while the sword &amp; shield are unsheathed.</p>
<p>Dual Blades</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where landing a Focus Strike with the Dual Blades on Gogmazios while airborne caused the player to move erratically.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue causing unintended elemental effects to be displayed on Artian weapons.</p>
<p>Skills</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters inside a shield could still take damage during Omega Planetes’s Delta Attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue that caused Support Hunters to be unable to get in or out of the underwater combat area during the Lagiacrus hunt.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<h2>System</h2>
<p>– During a Field Survey, if the player deals extensive damage to a large monster that isn't the current quest target, the health value conditions that would prevent that monster from becoming a target in a subsequent Field Survey have been relaxed.</p><p>– Fixed an issue where unnecessary chat logs (indicating monsters leaving the locale) could display during a Special Environment Quest in which the environment contains a monster of the same species as large monsters that are already designed to appear in that quest.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the Cosmetic DLC Pass text was not displaying correctly under Add-ons in the Support Desk menu.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the pattern thickness for the "Whitewing Caparison" decoration could not be adjusted in Seikret Customization.</p>
<p>– Added a fix to correct weapon performance when unintended bonus combinations are applied during reinforcement of Artian Weapons or Gogma Artian Weapons.</p>
<p>– We have implemented a solution to reduce the load time experienced at startup when the user has a large number of add-ons.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue where some voice lines would not trigger properly.</p>
<p>– Fixed various text issues.</p>
<p>– Fixed other miscellaneous issues.</p>
<p>If you're wondering when the next update for Monster Hunter Wilds is coming, we heard that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-sets-summer-2026-reveal">we're getting a Sunbreak or Iceborne-sized, "large-scale" expansion later this year</a>, with the first news about what that expansion looks like coming in summer. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto told us that it'd be a big patch, but other than that, we're in the dark about what it will contain.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report has revealed that Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">ill-fated first person shooter Highguard</a>, was funded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> studio group TiMi. The full scope of this funding, its connection if any to recent layoffs, and the reason for its secrecy remains unclear.</p>
<p>The story,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"> broken by Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, emphasizes that Wildlight was and remains "technically independent" from Tencent / TiMi, and notes that Tencent has a public and vast presence in funding Western Game Development. For example, Tencent is a major investor in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">and backed Ubisoft's Vantage Studios subsidiary</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of Tencent investing could be Arrowhead Studios, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent bought up a 15% stake in Arrowhead Games</a> following the release of the hugely popular PvE third person shooter.</p>
<p>However, unlike those aforementioned games, Tencent / TiMi's involvement in Wildlight wasn't publicly announced. You can't, for example, <a href="https://www.timistudios.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#games">see the game listed in the TiMi Studio Group website</a>. Why was this?</p>
<p>Well, Games Business editor in chief Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2023897547136237992">provided some context</a> to how independent studio funding works which could explain the situation. "When a big independent studio forms, they typically go through funding rounds where they ask investors to support their project/studio", Dring posted on X. "Various groups can invest in these rounds. Historically, Tencent has been a regular investor in new teams. You'd be surprised at how many other devs have 'secret' (but not actually secret) Tencent backing.</p><p>"Games require funds to be made. Being backed by investors doesn't make you any less independent. Heck, a lot of the time, the investment isn't even enough to cover everything. Multiple rounds are usually required, and even then it might need a publisher. Tencent, and similar investors, are not a well of money people can keep coming back to. In most cases, it's some funds to get going, and then it's on the developers to deliver the rest."</p>
<p>So, this all may be a lot less exciting than it initially appears. Even so, an interesting peak perhaps into the world of independent studios, how they're funded, and what that means. This report from Game File comes at roughly the same time as the Highguard website was suddenly taken down.</p>

            <p>
Classic arena shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> has risen from the grave and is now available to download for free, all thanks to a dedicated group of fans working with developer Epic Games' blessing. And the upshot of all this is the much-loved arena FPS has received its first patch "in over 20 years".
</p>
<p>
When Unreal Tournament 2004 originally launched, Eurogamer branded it the "mother of all first-person shooters", praising its massive map roster, its 32-player Onslaught mode, and the welcome introduction of vehicles. All that was enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ut2004-pc">earn it ye olde 9/10</a>, and plenty of other people loved it too. However, support for Unreal Tournament 2004 officially ended in 2022, when Epic terminated its legacy online services and pulled the game - alongside a number of titles - from digital storefronts.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out the end was not the end. Late last year, fan community OldUnreal announced it was working to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 (the group previously resurrected Unreal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> 1999), patch it with bug fixes and quality of life improvements, then release it for free - all with Epic's blessing. And that day has finally arrived, with Unreal Tournament 2004 (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">PC Gamer</a>) available to download right now.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">heading over to the OldUnreal website</a>, interested Windows users can download and run the group's newly released installer. That, in turn, will grab the original Unreal Tournament 2004 disc image from OldUnreal's servers, extract their contents, install the game, and automatically patch it to the latest version. Linux and macOS users are <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">pointed toward the group's Github page</a>.
</p><p>
"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," project manager (and professor of computer science) Stijn-volckaert writes in the game's <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">new patch notes</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"
</p>
<p>
So there you go! The "mother of all first-person shooters" can now be downloaded and played for free - and what better time to start revisiting some video game classics than right now, when AI companies are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">making it increasingly difficult to buy new hardware</a>?

            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil</a> franchise is the <em>bad </em>kind of nightmare when it comes to adaptations. The movie series kickstarted by Paul W.S. Anderson back in 2002 found tonnes of success, but it's hard to suggest it was quality blockbuster filmmaking. Then came an <em>even worse </em>(despite all the reverence for the source material) movie in 2021, that failed to create a new continuity. And let's not talk about Netflix's 2022 series... Now, in 2026, we're waiting to see whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger can right this ship</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside Sinners, it's safe to say Weapons was one of 2025's biggest and most celebrated horror movies, mixing refreshing thrills, raw horror, unexpected comedy and wild twists in a way we rarely see these days. By all accounts, Cregger <em>should </em>have the sauce to make a very fun Resident Evil movie even if he chooses to completely step away from what's been done before in movies and video games. (And it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">he's doing exactly that</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, during a <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/oliver-berben-constantin-film-resident-evil-berlin-efm-1236718667/">chat with Deadline</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/weapons-director-had-carte-blanche-to-do-whatever-he-wanted-with-resident-evil-movie-reboot-studio-ceo-says/">VGC</a>), Constantin Film CEO Oliver Berben, who stepped into the role nearly two years ago, elaborated on how the team is approaching this new attempt at 'cracking the code' of the enduring horror franchise. First, he doubled down on the idea that it's "far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil, only because Zach Cregger has his own style".</p>
<p>Like horror aficionados who have been keeping track and loving the last few years' best flicks in the space, Berben is also of the opinion the genre needs voices willing to take a handful of risks with every project. Of course, Cregger's body of work in the genre so far perfectly embodies that spirit, so it was "a no-brainer" to give him "the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to do with that IP".</p><p>"With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different," Berben added.</p>
<p>The next Resident Evil movie, which doesn't have an official title yet, was also co-written by Cregger alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">John Wick</a> veteran Shay Hatten. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">stars Austin Abrams (who already was a fan-favourite in Weapons)</a>, Paul Walter Hauser, Zach Cherry, and Kali Reis, among others. It's set to be distributed theatrically by Sony Pictures and will invade cinemas on September 18, 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a pretty sweet co-op game full of surprises. It also has one of the best original soundtracks of 2025, and that includes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531720/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN_The_Forsaken_Hollows/">Forsaken Hollows</a> DLC. Sadly, we were barred from putting together the ultimate FromSoftware-made Soulslike playlist until the expansion's music was made officially available. Now, the wait is finally over.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/2023396957709058235?s=20">Elden Ring social media channels</a> announced The Forsaken Hollows' unique tracks were free and out in the wild after a longer-than-desirable wait. It's no secret one of the most celebrated aspects of FromSoftware's output is the amazing compositions that accompany every banger, and Shoi Miyazawa's work on the DLC deserved to be fully released too.</p>
<p>You can find all the available options to listen to the full soundtrack <a href="https://lnk.to/vfQOnLvR">here</a>; Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Line Music, and more are included, so co-publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware went big with the release once again. The full album runs slightly over 44 minutes versus Nightreign's 2 hours and 24 minutes, fitting the DLC's size when compared to the full base game.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-composer-on-marilyn-manson-myst-and-more-ign-first">IGN interviewed Miyazawa</a> about his work on Nightreign and experience working for FromSoftware. He admitted he was an Armored Core fan first and foremost, well before joining the studio's efforts, and said King Crimson and Marilyn Manson are some of his key musical influences. For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Nightreign, however, the vibes were understandably more dark fantasy-like, and most players would agree he's created legendary soundtracks for these games alongside the other credited composers. Let's hope this isn't his last rodeo in the Lands Between.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to enjoy tons of success, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>. Its <em>actual health </em>hasn't been great in 2026 so far though.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, which translated in maps littered with all sorts of traps and ziplines, among other things. Game balance issues aside, this was also bad for performance in especially crowded areas, so you can imagine why Embark Studios needed to act quickly on that whole mess.</p>
<p>Right after a hotfix was deployed to deal with the duplication glitch, another problem arose: <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-immediately-suffers-an-infinite-ammo-exploit-after-embark-fixes-a-dupe-heightening-criticism-of-the-studios-soft-response-to-cheaters/">an infinite ammo exploit</a>. This one also affected magazine sizes and even gun durability, which completely demolished Arc Raiders' in-game economy and the loop of looting and making do with whatever you can scavenge and preserve. In the following weeks, Embark has been hitting the game hard with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/allnews/">patches</a>, both small and large, ahead of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-arrives-next-week-embark-confirms-but-there-will-be-no-major-game-update-this-week-to-tide-you-over-until-then/">this month's 'Shrouded Sky' content update</a>.</p>
<p>Today, 17th February, the developers also confirmed <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">they'd finished conducting a large investigation</a> into how the recent exploits and glitches came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future. "Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game's economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance," the article states before elaborating on why it's taken a while to see more substantial comms regarding all this drama.</p><p>Though the studios is supposedly better prepared for future events like these, the powers that be are warning they'll "be taking actions based on severity, intent, frequency, and impact." Warnings will be issued for "low-severity cases," coins obtained through these glitches will be deleted, and suspensions will be dished out for the "severe cases" that completely ruined other players' fun.</p>
<p>Embark is fully aware this won't be the last time it has to deal with rampaging exploits and whatnot, and is encouraging lawful raiders to share their findings through the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders">official Discord sever</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I am quite intrigued by Death Howl, which is a soulslike deck builder.  The game is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she leaves her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.</p><p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, meanwhile, garnered a lot of love for its dedication to toil and turmoil in Bohemia, told through the eyes of Henry of Skalitz. A hardy combat system and eager embrace of vulgarity come together in a compelling RPG well worth playing.</p>

            <p>One of the best racing horses in the modern era of the sport will be coming to Umamusume: Pretty Derby, according to a statement from the horse's owner.</p>
<p>Speaking to horse racing outlet Idolhorse following Forever Young's victory at the Saudi Cup yesterday, Susumu Fujita teases the appearance of the champion: "Forever Young will be in Umamusume soon, I can't say the exact details, but it's a huge thing for me personally that Forever Young can contribute to Umamusume."</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1984753867087888389">a mysterious tease from the official Umamusume: Pretty Derby last year</a>, which showed a silhouette of a horse and a date. This date, it turns out, is Forever Young's birthday. So there's some extra proof if you aren't convinced.</p>
<p>Umamusame: Pretty Derby remains an incredibly popular mobile game since it released back in 2021, and further still when it came out in Europe and America last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">It even won a Game Award</a> for Best Mobile Game, which is certainly something.</p>
<p>The developers of Pretty Derby, Cygames, announced in January <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">its intention to create an AI-focused sub studio</a>, aimed at producing "AI-services and tools". Following backlash, Cygames rolled this back somewhat, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/umamusume-developer-apologises-after-ai-studio-backlash-says-it-will-not-use-generative-ai-without-prior-notice">it wouldn't use generative AI "without prior notice"</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have a horse you'd like to see in Umamusame: Pretty Derby? Oh, and if a certain song is stuck in your head, you're looking for Forever Young by Alphaville.</p>

            <p>
Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg has touted generative AI advancements in its game engine that'll soon enable users to "prompt full casual games into existence" just by using natural language.
</p>
<p>
While generative AI remains controversial, given its many ethical implications, the technology has found a foothold in game development. A GDC survey conducted earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-survey-reveals-layoffs-up-6-36-of-industry-using-ai-and-overwhelming-support-for-unionisation-in-the-us">revealed 36 percent of respondents now use AI</a> - predominantly for 'research and brainstorming', although code assistance and daily tasks such as writing emails were the other most cited uses.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, game engine company Unity has been looking to both drive and capitalise on the AI boom, with CEO Matthew Bromberg now bullishly highlighting what he sees as the next step in 'democratising' game development. As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-">reported by Game Developer</a>, Bromberg - speaking to investors during a recent earnings called - flagged an upcoming Unity AI beta update that'll expand the company's ambitions for "AI-driven authoring".
</p>
<p>
This new beta, set to be unveiled at the Game Developer Conference in March, will "enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform," Bloomberg claimed, "so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product." 
</p><p>
"Our goal, he continued, "is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience". Bromberg later told investors the company is envisaging a future where "tens of millions" of people are "creating interactive entertainment" driven by AI-enabled development tools.
</p>
<p>
While generative AI adoption increases, its use remains contentious. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> studio Larian reversed course after its admission of using the technology for concept art creation drew ire. Meanwhile, other studios have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/worried-about-project-windless-and-generative-ai-dont-fret-krafton-says-the-game-is-not-using-generative-ai-for-content-creation-or-narrative-elements">sought to get ahead of controversy</a> by assuring audiences their use of generative AI is limited. Last week, for instance, Krafton's Project Windless team said it would not be using the tool for "content creation or narrative elements" but confirmed it was using generative AI "internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency".
</p>
<p>
Back in 2024, Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">explored some of the ways AI is changing game development</a> - although the escalating AI arms among tech giants, and the resulting memory shortages it's now causing, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">increasingly threatening to impact the games industry in other ways</a>.

            <p>Things aren't looking great when it comes to the ongoing RAM and storage shortages, and the Asus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> is being hit with a price increase in Japan that may or may not extend to other territories.</p>
<p>The current tech drama kickstarted by the AI and data centre boom is already altering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony and Nintendo's plans for hardware in the coming years</a>, with Microsoft likely missing the big console generation refresh next year too. Even worse, prices are expected to keep surging as stock dwindles and hardware production stalls or greatly slows down. It's bad, it'll get <em>way worse</em>, and no one knows when things might get better.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-gets-a-price-increase-of-nearly-200-in-japan/">via VGC</a>, we're learning about the ROG Xbox Ally X situation in Japan. As spotted by the site <a href="https://0115765.com/archives/172482">Otaku Souken</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X is upping its price tag to ¥169,800 ($1,109) vs. the previous ¥139,800 ($913) mark. That's a whopping $196 increase. The standard ROG Xbox Ally seemingly isn't altering its ¥89,800 ($585) price, however.</p>
<p>An official reason for the price increase hasn't been shared yet, but everyone is thinking about the same thing pending confirmation; as pointed out by VGC, the RAM on the big Xbox Ally is faster than the regular model's. With the more expensive model now almost doubling the price of the regular one, it'll be quite interesting to see how both perform in the Japanese market in the coming months. As a reminder, Xbox products have never been too big over there, so this probably won't go down well.</p><p>The difficult situation has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">forced Valve to delay the release (originally planned for early 2026) of the Steam Machine and Frame</a>, which are now expected by most enthusiasts to arrive at higher price points (though we never got official word on those with the reveal). Even worse, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">securing a Steam Deck is becoming harder</a> as I write this. Thanks, Big Tech.</p>

            <p>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast-owned studio Atomic Arcade has reportedly been shut down.</p>
<p>Word of the studio's fate comes from numerous LinkedIn posts citing the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brandon-miller-3734ba77_hi-everyone-im-currently-exploring-new-ugcPost-7429285429494984704-qbn8/">"recent closure" of Atomic Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Hasbro has made the call to close Atomic Arcade," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkimball_opentowork-activity-7429273899965636608-4DCD/">one such post reads</a>. "I was only with the studio for about a year, but from the start I felt the studio had tons of talent and potential. I'll miss working with the team we had, and wish everyone the best."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade was working on a game based around GI Joe character Snake Eyes, which for now remains in development despite changes at the studio.</p>
<p>"The Snake Eyes game is not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game," a Hasbro representative said in a statement shared with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/">Wccftech</a>. "While decisions haven't been finalised, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able."</p>
<p>Hasbro first announced plans to make a GI Joe game based on Snake Eyes all the way back in 2022, and Atomic Arcade was established. At this time, Atomic Arcade's Ames Kirshen told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snake-eyes-and-the-evolution-of-adaptation">Eurogamer's sister-site GamesIndustrybiz</a>:</p>
<p>"I always had this great desire to tackle G.I. Joe and take a crack at making an amazing game with the IP because I think there's a lot of potential there... So long story short, we decided to build a studio to support that franchise, to support that game."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade is not the only studio to be the subject of layoffs this year. Just this weekend, GTFO and Den of Wolves developer 10 Chambers confirmed a "large number" of layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-and-den-of-wolves-developer-10-chambers-confirms-large-number-of-layoffs-including-several-of-the-studios-co-founders">which included "several of the studio's co-founders"</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Highlight developer Wildlight was also impacted by layoffs earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">only a "core" group left to work on the free-to-play shooter</a>.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a> have seemingly been removed from the PS3 digital store, shortly after the reveal of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol.2.</p>
<p>Spotted by the keen enthusiasts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1r6o33l/konami_have_delisted_the_psn_versions_of_metal/">on the dedicated PS3 Reddit</a>, players can still see both games on the store, but are unable to actually buy them. It's worth noting that if you already own the game digitally or physically, those copies should still work just fine on the PS3.</p>
<p>The Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2, which was revealed during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony State of Play earlier this year</a>, includes both of the aforementioned games as well as Metal Gear Ghost Babel. It'll be coming to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. This collection is especially noteworthy as Metal Gear Solid 4 was previous trapped on the PS3, having not been ported to other platforms.</p>
<p>That game does, however, have some features and quirks unique to the PS3. Konami stated many of these will be faithfully replicated in the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol.2, but sadly multiplayer is being left in the past. It's a shame too, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> certainly had a dedicated community of keen players back in the PS3 era.</p><p>Previously, Konami developers said that remaking Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots like Metal Gear Solid 3 was in the recent Metal Gear Delta  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-series-producer-remakes-metal-gear-solid-4">would be "pretty hard"</a>. This port in the Master Collection certainly isn't that, but who knows? Maybe if it proves popular we'll see a fully remade reimagination of the end of Snake's saga.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years</link>
            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>This is much more like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> I wanted when it launched. We're having a redo moment. Blizzard isn't calling this a relaunch but to me, it feels like it is. This is a reintroduction of a game that floundered back in 2023 at launch, but three years later, it's solid and it's stacked. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (the 2 was symbolically dropped from the title recently) knows what it wants to be now and this is the fullest and strongest this game has ever been. Arguably it's also the strongest the series (can we call it a series now?) has ever been, which is a provocative thing to say, I know. But I haven't been this excited about Overwatch since the original came out 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Note, I haven't played for three years since the sequel launched, which is an important factor here because returning after all that time is borderline overwhelming - in a very good way. Last week's expansion was the catalyst that brought me back, but even putting aside the five new heroes, the UI overhaul and the story push the expansion brings, there are maps, heroes and modes I've never seen before. How long have you been able to upgrade abilities for?! It doesn't matter: the point is that to me, it's all new. Loading the Practice Range to try these unknown heroes is like diving into an unopened chocolate box. It's a hell of a sugar rush.</p>
<p>Case in point: I'm a support player at my core, a healer of sorts. Like Mother Teresa. And one of my bugbears with the original Overwatch was that there weren't many support characters to play. I got bored with what was on offer and the slow wait for new characters to refresh the list. (This comment could be applied to many areas of the game.) But now there are several support heroes and my current obsession is Juno, who bombs around the map on hover boots with a Martian ray-gun that can heal and also damage, and damage enough that I'd be tempted to classify her as a damage dealer. I've taken names; I even got a Play of the Game once. She's great. But she isn't new - Juno was added in August 2024.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>I love you Juno, even if I've given you a Hello Kitty skin. But look at all those heroes! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Or take Stadium, a whole new mode added to Overwatch last summer. Here you buy buffs for characters' abilities as you play, a bit like how you do in a MOBA. It's a best of five match spread across different game types, and before you begin, and between each round thereafter, you have time to buy upgrades from an armoury. This means you can alter the builds of your favourite heroes, doubling down on damage or survivability or utility - whatever you like. And this is mind-blowing to me. I've never been able to alter or adjust a character's abilities in Overwatch before. It is wild and it <em>feels </em>wild in play. Imagine a whole team of supercharged Overwatch heroes and you're close to what it's like. It's a significantly different way to play.</p><p>But again, Stadium isn't new - it's <em>newer </em>but it's still been around for a bit. There is a new part of it, a build-helper, which suggests builds and auto-applies them, and it's incredibly helpful for new players - I don't know where I'd be without it. And actually, it's in this helper that a wider point about Overwatch - and why it's currently so enjoyable - comes to the surface. Yes, it's giddying exploring everything that's been added and done to the game in three years, as well all of the expansion-based stuff. But more pertinent is a feeling that this moment is designated for lapsed Overwatch players to return, or for new players to come in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Stadium helper in action. Here, I'm playing as Reinhardt, and these are the initial Armoury options available to me. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I can't stress the importance of this point enough. New and returning players seem to be here in abundance. It doesn't only mean that the game feels re-energised because there are more people playing it - match queues are short to nonexistent - but it feels welcoming because of who is playing it. You don't know the ropes? Fine. You're in good company. There are newer players (visible by the levels of the characters they're playing) everywhere, which not only gives you and me a chance in matches, but also makes for a wider kind of tolerance from the existing players in the game.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I avoided going back to Overwatch 2 for so long was because I was out of touch and out of practice, and didn't want to be told off for not knowing what I was doing by some idiot in group chat. Whether or not that would have happened, I don't know, but it certainly isn't happening now. People are, dare I say it, friendly, which might be because I'm (probably annoyingly) chatty, but there's a palpable sense of camaraderie here, both in people reconnecting with the game and in people pleased the game they play is resurgent. I feel welcomed. I feel encouraged. It's like people are happy to see Overwatch doing well again, and that's a very nice feeling to be around, though I can't speak to the mood in Competitive, which tends to be more tense, because I haven't mustered the courage to play there yet.</p><p>This expansion moment has been like Blizzard firing a gun in the woods and startling people into noticing Overwatch again, and the difference this time is Overwatch is ready for the attention. The happy added bonus is that adding five new heroes at once to the game has also - to continue my weaponised metaphors - thrown a hand grenade into the game's meta. Currently, things are upended, unsettled, and that's exciting - there's enough new stuff happening at the moment that even regular players have things to discover. Jetpack Cat in particular is capturing attention for her ability to tow other characters through the air and open new tactical possibilities. But for all the talk about her, I haven't seen her much in game. Or if I have, I haven't noticed her having a game-shaking effect. Though again, maybe that's different at higher skill levels.</p>
<p>Whether or not Overwatch maintains this excitement for me, and this general sense of momentum, I can't yet know. There are moments when staleness creeps in, while playing old heroes on old maps, but there's still so much newness around it that it doesn't taint the experience for long. Plus of course there are more heroes and hero reworks to come this year, which I'm particularly excited about, and a new expansion promised at the start of every year hereafter. The intention from Blizzard is clearly to try and keep the momentum up. Still, Overwatch doesn't exist in a vacuum any more. There's strong competition in Marvel Rivals, and in hero-shooter-inspired games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Valorant, which wasn't the case when Overwatch once reigned supreme. But for me, right now, Overwatch is back.</p>

            <p>
As the tech giants' escalating AI arms race continues to impact RAM supplies, Valve has confirmed Steam Deck is the latest machine to face availability issues as a result of memory and storage shortages.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">direct results of the tech industry's continuing push into AI</a>. Substantial quantities of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as tech giant including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to invest in new AI data centres to remain competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
It's an issue that's already threatening to have a significant impact on consumer electronics. Earlier this year, for instance, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its new Steam Machines</a>, specifically blaming memory and storage shortages - but it's not just the company's future hardware that's impacted. Valve has also now confirmed its current Steam Deck line-up is similarly affected.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">message on its Steam Deck store page</a>, Steam Deck OLED "may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages". At the time of writing, all three Steam Deck models - the 256GB LCD model, as well as the 512GB and 1TB OLED - are unavailable in the US, but supplies in other countries, including the UK, remain available for now. Notably, Valve confirmed it was discontinuing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB back in December, meaning no more stock is being produced.
</p><p>
Valve's dwindling Steam Deck supplies come amid reports that other gaming companies are considering dramatic responses to AI-driven memory shortages. This week, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony is looking to delay the launch of its PS6</a> into 2028 or 2029, while Nintendo is said to be mulling over a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> price increase later this year.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">took a closer look at the issues surrounding RAM</a> and what they might mean for gaming.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> feels like something that happened ages ago, but Ubisoft's failed battle royale game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-beleaguered-battle-royale-game-hyper-scape-is-shutting-down-in-april">was shut down in April 2022</a> after halting its content updates a year before that. The game itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-scape-review-a-battle-royale-as-smart-as-it-is-generic">wasn't anything special</a>, yet no small amount of FPS veterans praised its core traversal and movement mechanics. This is why a passionate fan is attempting to bring it back from the live-service graveyard.</p>
<p>On 16th February, <a href="https://x.com/fiirce">Fiirce</a> on X/Twitter revealed Hyper Scape working offline (with bots that serve as target practice) perfectly fine. That alone is an achievement, as the game's core functionality was tied to Ubisoft's server infrastructure, which was shut down back in 2022. The user underlines this is a very early effort running on a private server, with largely limited alpha access that must be requested and primarily targets players with "reverse engineering experience" that want to help out with the project. You can see the game running below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Fiirce isn't promising a working release of Hyper Scape anytime soon, as figuring out how to make <em>at least </em>the basic online features work could take "months or even years." That said, it has been getting a lot of traction over at X/Twitter since the gameplay clip was posted, which could summon the required expertise quickly and get a proper reverse-engineering effort going soon.</p>
<p>In any case, there's also the question of whether Ubisoft will step in and shut down the project as many publishers do when fans take over dead IPs to work on non-profit new games or revivals. Nobody's expecting the powers that be to ever revisit Hyper Scape, so this shouldn't bother them, but you never know if another publisher could swoop in and pick up the rights to do <em>something</em>. Remember <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/paragon-the-overprime">Paragon: The Overprime</a>?</p><p>This fan-led revival project joins the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">the experiments some people are doing on Anthem</a> shortly after its death. Live-service games are hard to maintain and make really sustainable, but when these endeavours become so common, you have to wonder if the failed IPs that litter the games industry should be made public instead of thrown into vaults.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, has broken a rather impressive Steam record.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mewgenics - which sees players using "tactical" breeding to raise a cat army before sending their feline Frankenstein-like creations into the fray - welcomed 115,428 concurrent players on Steam.</p>
<p>This number probably doesn't mean that much to you on its own, though it is of course an impressive figure. However, Mewgenics' latest concurrent player peak actually means it now has the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em>.</p>
<p>The Steam game with the highest concurrent player count before Mewgenics took the crown was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant's sequel to the incredibly successful Hades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">2025 Game of the Year nominee</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see via the image below, Hades 2 has a concurrent player peak of 112,947, which was reached five months ago. This means Mewgenics has welcomed 2,481 more concurrent players than Steam's previous roguelike record holder (look at me doing maths early in the morning).</p><p>So, yes, Mewgenics is really rather popular, something that has taken co-creators Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel by surprise. On its release, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and developer Glaiel later revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC is planned</a>, though for when we don't yet know. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>, but again, we don't know when exactly it may materialise.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> might not be one of the most popular roguelites around, but it's charmed enough veterans and newcomers since it launched into 1.0 last year. We figured it would be ending its development run shortly afterwards, but Evil Empire (one of the studios now hard at work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castlevania-belmonts-curse-is-the-beginning-of-numerous-new-products-around-castlevania">the next Castlevania</a>) isn't done upgrading it yet.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the developer revealed a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/541130614987817395">spring 2026 roadmap</a> featuring two major updates currently scheduled to drop in April and May. You can check it out below:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First up, the 'Breathless Update' will add the Freeze element, arenas, a higher difficulty option, weapon and tool affixes, new tools, new medallions, faster pacing, and other improvements which aim to both amp up and streamline the overall experience. What does the team mean by "faster pacing"? Well, it appears the first hour of the game is getting a substantial rework, and then we'll have "quicker and tougher" versions of the following biomes. This will be done through updates to the level design and the difficulty provided by enemies (regular and bosses alike).</p><p>Later, the 'Endgame Update' (which hasn't been fully locked down yet) will add the Nyamtur trials for "risk &amp; reward" across all levels, a still-undefined "parkour mode," and a rework of the Palace biome. Moreover, challenges and pets (we don't know anything about them yet) are coming. Even Evil Empire isn't sure about what will be included in this one, but the devs are confident it might be <em>even </em>larger in the end.</p>
<p>As an extra, The Rogue Prince of Persia is kicking off 2026 with a new tool that's already available in-game: "We've added the Flaming Horses — a tool that will unleash a herd of flaming horses that charge forward, leaving a burning trail behind them." Cool stuff.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, a spin off from the hugely popular battle royale, will be shutting down on 17th April.</p>
<p>This comes following previous changes to the ongoing support for the game, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-pulls-call-of-duty-warzone-from-ios-and-google-play-stores">which included its removal from app stores in May 2025</a>. With no new content added to the game since then, it seems the final death knell for the ill-fated shooter is almost here.</p>
<p>A statement posted <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">on the Activision Support website reads</a>: "Since then, we have made the final decision to take Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile offline. While we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately did not meet our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>
<p>Guest accounts used to play Call of Duty Warzone Mobile will no longer be able to play the game when it shuts down. However, if you used an Activision account, you'll obviously still be able to use that to play Call of Duty Mobile or Call of Duty on PC and consoles. If you've got any unspent CoD points lying around on Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, the FAQ section suggests spending them before the 17th as they'll be unavailable to use after the servers shut down. Some unlockable content in Warzone mobile can be used in other versions of Warzone.</p><p>This game publicly launched shakily when compared to Call of Duty Mobile. According to Pocket Gamer, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-generates-14m-in-first-four-days/">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile generated $1.4m in its first four days</a>. Call of Duty Mobile made $4.2m in the same amount of time. Add that on top of recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">falling play numbers for Call of Duty in general</a> and you can glimpse at why the servers are being turned off.</p>

            <p>Do you remember the .hack series? Are you even old enough to know what it is? Don't worry if your answer is negative, as even RPG veterans admit it wasn't particularly big in the West. Still, it remains one of the most fascinating series out there, albeit a hard one to follow due to its complicated titling and transmedia characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, just in time for studio CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, a new project has been announced out of nowhere: .hack//Z.E.R.O. marks the return of the franchise, which had been dormant on the games front since 2017's .hack//G.U. Last Recode remaster. You can watch the first trailer below:</p> <figure>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2," <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/">the official website</a> reveals. Yes, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19641-cyberconnect2s-30th-anniversary-game-revealed-as-hackzero-action-rpg-for-consoles">it appears Bandai Namco isn't letting go of the IP rights</a> and doesn't want to put money into the project, but thankfully, the entertainment giant has allowed it to happen with the original developers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reveal, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142">Famitsu</a> has published an interview with CyberConnect2's CEO Hiroshi "Piros" Matsuyama, who's serving as executive producer on Z.E.R.O. It's unclear right now if the game will follow an episodic format or happen over several entries in the style of the original series and the G.U. trilogy. However, more details were uncovered.</p><p>First, Matsuyama has said Z.E.R.O. isn't connected to previous entries in the franchise, which should help newcomers jump in without previous knowledge of the universe. The World, the online game inside which the bulk of the stories was set, will also return, but they're pushing 10 years into the future with the setting in order to double down on social media as a central part of our lives. Moreover, there will be a special focus on real drama between humans and "multiple layers of society as the main enemies," including an evil corporation (of course).</p>
<p>You'll have to wait for more details and the first in-game footage, but CyberConnect2 has also stated <a href="https://nichegamer.com/hack-z-e-r-o-announced/">they've been trying to get this game done for nearly a decade</a>, so chances are this is being treated as a big new beginning for the franchise rather than a one-and-done spinoff.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared its Winter Roadmap for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>The roadmap includes a community parkour challenge, as well as full manual jump, a detailed stats page and critical hit visual improvements. These particular upcoming additions all arrive tomorrow, 17th February.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has said Shadows' upcoming detailed stats page will be ideal for "all the min-maxers out there". As for that manual jump being added to Parkour, players will need to enable Advanced Parkour Options in the gameplay settings to get this chap working.</p>
<p>If you are curious about that aforementioned community parkour challenge, here is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535499747044098727">Ubisoft</a> has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your perfect one-shot run</li>
<li>Think flow, style, momentum. Choose a unique location or craft the coolest combo you can imagine. Your clip must be: One unedited shot, 45 to 60 seconds long and set anywhere in the world of Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>
<li>Upload and share: Upload your run to YouTube before March 8th, then share it on X using #ACShadowsParkourChallenge.</li>
<li>Get noticed: You might become one of the lucky few that'll be showcased across Ubisoft social media or win cool prizes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then looking ahead to next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> players can expect the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a> on 10th March. This expansion introduces a new region, as well as a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. Ahead of its release elsewhere, Ubisoft said this expansion would add over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>
<p>Last up for this batch of winter events, all players can look forward to livestreams and giveaways to celebrate the game's first anniversary on 20th March.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong debut on its release last year, and in July Ubisoft celebrated five million players (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">which also made up 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted</a>). That number will of course be higher now, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Shadows' Switch 2 release in December</a>.</p><p>It hasn't all been good news for the Assassin's Creed franchise and Ubisoft, though. In October, then-Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté left the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios. It soon transpired that Côté "did not walk away" but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">it was reported Côté was suing Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation is finally picking up some momentum, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">having been initially announced several years ago</a>. The show is set to star Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor said to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has slowly but steadily become one of 2026's open world games to watch out for, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visually-impressive-open-world-fantasy-adventure-crimson-desert-goes-gold-locks-march-launch">with a March release date now locked</a>, lots of people are seriously starting to consider making a trip to Pywel soon. At the same time, veterans might have reservations about jumping in at launch based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a>'s MTX-heavy model.</p>
<p>Of course, large numbers of microtransactions and optional cosmetics are to be expected any time a game's model is free-to-play, and Pearl Abyss' PR and marketing director Will Powers reminded everyone of that during his appearance in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">episode 457 of the Dropped Frames</a> podcast (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/that-is-the-transaction-crimson-desert-wont-have-microtransactions-says-pearl-abyss-because-the-promising-open-world-game-is-a-premium-experience/">GamesRadar</a>): "It's a monetization model: if you do free-to-play, then you need to make up the revenue in a different way." Easy to understand if you've been playing video games in the last 20 years or so, but we all know we often need to make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>You can't blame veterans for thinking even a strictly single-player game like Crimson Desert (which did start off as an online project) could be filled with microtransactions à la Assassin's Creed though. After all, it'd be easy for Pearl Abyss to pull the trigger on those if the game is a massive success, as we know for a fact players typically like putting more money into the experiences they greatly enjoy.</p>
<p>Powers shot such thoughts and comments down quickly: "This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions." Here's where we underline such decisions are above his pay grade and anything could happen post-launch, but it seems that's where Pearl Abyss officially stands right now. If you're picking up Crimson Desert, you're getting a traditional, fully featured open-world adventure with no cosmetics or mounts earned via MTX. "This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Like, full stop."</p><p>That said, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert has three different editions</a> (both digital and physical) up for pre-order at the time of writing, each of which with extra items and cosmetics, so you're definitely missing out on some stuff if you simply pick up the cheaper version. <a href="https://x.com/WillJPowers/status/2023218876105072790?s=20">Powers has acknowledged those</a> on X/Twitter though: "The overall point is that we're not holding back content to sell separately."</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt anyone was fearing Crimson Desert could be short on content, as every piece of footage from the game we've seen suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4euv-AX4E">it's trying to do <em>almost </em>everything</a> the devs came up with during the concept and planning stage. Will it pay off? It won't be long before we find out, as the game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and even Mac on 19th March.</p>

            <p>
Sony is reportedly looking to push back the launch of PlayStation 6 in response to memory shortages caused by tech giants' continuing AI expansion drive, while Nintendo is said to be considering a price hike for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices have made headlines in recent times, both issues arising as tech companies continue their push into AI. Substantial amounts of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to throw money at AI data centres in order to stay competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
Supply issues and spiralling costs could have a significant impact on consumer electronics, with Valve having already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its Steam Machines</a> as it grapples with memory and storage shortages. Similarly, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">reportedly looking to increase the price of its Xbox Series X/S yet again</a> in response to global RAM shortages.
</p>
<p>
As to how Xbox's closest rivals might respond, Bloomberg - citing "people familiar with the company's thinking" - <a href="https://archive.is/20260216113541/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">now reports</a> Sony is considering shifting the release of PlayStation 6 to 2028 or 2029. While the company has never publicly discussed a launch window for its next-gen console, documents leaked in 2022 suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-doesnt-expect-playstation-6-before-2027-confidential-document-suggests">wouldn't release PS6 until at least 2027</a>.
</p><p>
Since then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM1Fq8nAGPo&amp;t=3399s">reports have surfaced</a> claiming Sony is looking to begin manufacturing its next-gen console early next year for a 2027 release, but some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps6-may-not-arrive-in-2028-analyst-predicts">more recently suggested a launch in 2028 or beyond</a> is now likelier. Bloomberg writes that if Sony delays PS6 into 2028 or 2029 as a result of memory issues, it would be a "major upset to a carefully orchestrated strategy to sustain user engagement between hardware generations". Sony's current console, PS5, launched in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Nintendo, Bloomberg says a price hike for Switch 2 may be on the way. Citing "people familiar with [the company's] plans", it claims Nintendo is currently "contemplating" raising the price of its latest console - which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-finally-surpasses-the-nintendo-ds-to-become-companys-best-selling-console-ever">sold over 17m units</a> since launching in 2025 - later this year. In January, Nintendo said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">RAM shortages would have no "immediate impact" on the price of Switch 2</a>, but earlier this month, company president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/memory-price-rises-have-not-impacted-the-switch-2-yet-says-nintendo-president">warned things might change</a> if the trend continues into the next fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
If you're curious to learn more about the issues surrounding RAM at present, and what they might mean for gaming, Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">recently took a closer look</a> at what one tech commentator has called a "perfect storm of unpreparedness, panic, and greed".

            <p>If you were watching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">last week's Sony State of Play</a>, you'll have surely seen the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>. Hectic chases through exotic planets, tense moments between the drivers, and… Wait. Hang on. That crash, it looked a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/burnout-paradise-remastered-studio-teases-series-revival">a Burnout crash</a>? Was that real, or some cinematic sleight of hand aimed at getting 2000's arcade racing fans overly eager?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it was the real thing. That trailer, entirely captured in-engine, did in fact show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-creators-of-burnout-are-making-a-crash-mode-spiritual-successor-called-danger-zone">a Burnout-style crash</a> as a small exciting moment in Galactic Racer's campaign mode. This, while obviously being a sweet touch for a ramshackle racing game, is one element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-will-have-podracers">what appears to be narrative-rich rally royale fitting snuggly within Star Wars canon</a>.</p>
<p>"Yes, you might have seen a bit of that!" Kieran Crimmins told Eurogamer, laughing from what appeared to be his home office. Crimmins, as the creative director of Star Wars Galactic Racer, is one of many who formed Fuse Games; a backup car filled with former Criterion developers. These creatives, with a lengthy history working on all manner of racing games including the Burnout series, are bringing their talents to a galaxy far far away.</p>
<p>"Fuse was made with a combination of people who have worked together for a fairly long time, there's things we've loved in Arcade racing - visceral high-octane action and want to bring that to this game," Crimmins explained. "Those sensibilities and some of that DNA from previous games we've worked on, obviously that's in this game because we want to bring that stuff. It's the core of pick-up-and-play arcade racing with great depth, but also great thrill. There's also certain game mechanics that are part of our DNA in there as well."</p><p>Crimmins was joined by one Craig Derrick, executive producer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/lucasfilm-games">Lucasfilm Games</a> working alongside Fuse Games on Galactic Racer, eager to speak on the game's authenticity. "I'd jump in to say it's high thrill, but also high risk! The spectacular crashes in Galactic Racer, there's elements of that you see in the Burnout series and other racing games, but also the Pod Racing sequence in Star Wars Episode One!</p>
<p>"The fragility of these vehicles in this game, the scrappiness we're implying in this era… They're really just put together for racing, sort of inherently dangerous to race and in a place where crashes are gonna happen. We want to be able to show that! Cinematically in a fun way, but also lean into the arcade elements while emphasizing this is a dangerous sport you're engaging in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Speedbikes are one of the many vehicles you'll be able to mess around with. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Fuse Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"All the vehicles we have tie into that threat level, as well as the opportunistic choices you can make to win the race. This includes the vehicle you choose, the type of environment you're in, the type of line you're racing in. But yeah, spectacular crashes are going to happen."</p><p>These Burnout-style crashes, while certainly appealing to the Star Wars layperson, also play an integral part of the fantasy according to Derrick and Crimmins. With the Galactic Empire in tatters, people across the Star Wars fiction are having to pull the pieces together and build something meaningful, with some using these pieces to build junkyard vehicles to race vicious across the stars.</p>
<p>"There's a few different things from a play point-of-view," Crimmins said. "Putting our expertise and studio sensibilities into the Star Wars space, it has a rich landscape of vehicle fantasies. Some core pillar racing fantasy, but also as Craig said this used-universe of cobbled together vehicles. All those flavourings are key to that Star Wars vehicle fantasy.</p>
<p>"So while we have our own studio sensibilities, we looked to our partners at Lucas to make sure we translate those into an authentic Star Wars experience. That means having high-octane visceral action with risk / reward mechanics, but also a breadth of experiences you can have in the game. Telling a story, you've got characters and a running storyline that feels like a Star Wars journey you're going on. It's why we've worked so closely with Lucas, so you get that Star Wars magic."</p>
<p>Derrick linked the game very much to this particular era of Star Wars, as well as real world racing history: "For us at Lucas it's all about story, it starts with story. Obviously the film part of Lucas Film is the storytelling part of that, the games part is how you make that interactive. How do you tell an amazing story where you have agency? I think we do that really well, and we're doing that well here. This is ultimately an underdog story and it leans into elements you see in other racing stories, it speaks to the origins of this new league popping up around the end of the Galactic Empire. It's also evocative of this time around the end of World War 2, when all these people had all this machinery. When it was about Hot Rods, testing out jet engines and slamming them in the Salt Flats and trying to race. We have a scrappy group of characters in this that I feel is very exciting.</p><p>"And it's not galactic-wide stakes, it's a local story. There are stakes to each of these characters, they have agendas and reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. But it's less life or death and more win or lose. So it's strongly linked to the competitiveness of the story. The last thing I'll say about authenticity is it's all about aesthetics. It has to look like Star Wars. It has to read familiar as racing in that universe, and it's also the sounds. The music, the engines and these vehicles crunching and hitting each other that's grounded in some authenticity."</p>
<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer is out in 2026 on the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. No specific release date has been announced.</p>

            <section><p>The sequel to Squanch Games' detestable FPS demonstrates significant improvement, though its biggest features remain its weakest - and technical issues hinder the progress made.</p></section>
<p>I cannot stress how much I detested High on Life when its loser-ass jiggled out of its mum's basement in a suffocating cloud of weed-smoke. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a>' 2022 FPS was a cynical, jabbering mess that overcompensated for its limp gunplay with meandering, interminable stoner humour. Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">High on Life review</a> rightly lambasted it for its failings, and I personally would have been happy to never look at one of its grinning guns ever again.</p>

<p>At the same time, I believe in second chances, and High on Life 2 is at least a partial vindication of that belief. While I wouldn't say all is forgiven after our disastrous first date, Squanch Games has clearly been working on itself over the last three years. High on Life 2 is friendlier, funnier, and faster on the trigger than it was on our first outing. It's also become really effing good at skateboarding, which is unexpected but kinda hot.</p>
<p>Reprising your role of adolescent intergalactic bounty hunter, High on Life 2 kicks off with a playable montage of the events following your victory over the drug-dealing G3 cartel, which sought to corner the market in human-based narcotics. Rescuing humanity from the bottom of alien bongs has catapulted you to celebrity status, and High on Life 2's opening sequence flicks through your subsequent talk-show appearances, hover-limo rides, and battles against alien kaiju with impressive efficiency.</p>
<p>High on Life's high life is clearly wearing on your character, so it's something of a relief when a chance encounter with your sister (now a self-made resistance fighter) course-corrects you onto a new mission – taking down the ringleaders of Rhea Pharmaceutical. The galaxy's biggest drug manufacturer plans to get humans reclassified from illegal drug to medicinal pill, a move that would spell doom for the species… again.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a High on Life 2 trailer to show it in its chatty action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLpk12m1V3E" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>While hardly a sophisticated satire of Big Pharma, the switch yields a more interesting series of objectives than before. High on Life 2 sees you taking down eccentric billionaires, mad scientists, corrupt politicians and literal finance wizards in an array of colourful missions.</p><p>The highlight of these is ConCon, where you're tasked with assassinating the unfortunately named Muppy Doo – Rhea's biggest political supporter – on a planet that's basically Coruscant for conventions. Every activity imaginable has its own celebratory event on ConCon, from politics to murder. Even parking <em>for </em>the conventions is its own, brutally competitive festival, as drivers from across the galaxy compete for the best parking spots in a deadly game that combines musical chairs with vehicular manslaughter.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>From this opening parking-lot brawl to its fourth-wall breaking finale, ConCon showcases High on Life 2 at its most accomplished. Not every mission is so successful – a mid-game scenario where you infiltrate a cult in the Wyoming countryside suffers from staid level design and an overlong boss fight – but unlike the first game, High on Life 2 doesn't run out of imaginative steam halfway through, delivering new ideas into its final hour.</p>
<p>Even its least interesting locations are elevated by the sequel's biggest new feature – the skateboard. There's something mildly miraculous in how Squanch integrates skateboarding into both platforming and combat. By combining simplified controls that focus on ollies, wall-rides and glue-on grinding with more traditional action-game manoeuvres like a double jump and air-dash, Squanch produces a movement toolset that facilitates thrilling acrobatics without knotting your fingers together. Bunny-hopping across lines of hovering traffic in ConCon is tremendously satisfying, as is knocking down enemies by ollie-ing into their faces.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Compared to its colourful aliens, the human characters in High on Life 2 look Unreal Engine as heck. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The breeziness of the skateboarding is complemented by High on Life 2's broader adjustment in tone. Put simply, its writing is significantly less annoying than the first game. It's less crass, less misanthropic, less prone to adlibs that run on for far too long. In its place is a more sincere attempt to get you to bond with your talking arsenal. This is most successfully achieved with Travis, your new pistol who you meet in the depths of a self-pitying spiral after falling out with his weaponised wife, Jan. Over the course of several missions, their turbulent relationship is explored in noisy, but well-observed fashion, while Travis' lame-duck persona is the foundation of some fun jokes.</p><p>While a big improvement, I still think High on Life 2's humour falls short of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a> or Thank Goodness You're Here. The gap between word count and jokes that land is still too wide for my liking, and it still occasionally does that thing where an NPC obstructs you while constantly chittering about it. Nonetheless, the reduced hostility makes it easier to forgive High on Life 2 when the humour doesn't land, and there are good gags within the voluminous script. A late-game joke about stealth mechanics gave me a good chuckle, as did a running joke about one of your weapons' resemblance to a certain Star Wars character.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption> Finally, the Karma Chameleon has caught up with me. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>High on Life 2's biggest problem is that its primary mechanic – shooting – remains its weakest element. Again, it's a better FPS than Squanch's first attempt. The enemies are more varied and interesting, the skateboard adds versatility in navigating arenas, and your arsenal has been expanded with a couple of interesting firearms. These include a composite bow that can create dimensional rifts to shoot through, and an assault rifle voiced by Ralph Ineson (which is a back-of-the-box feature in and of itself.)</p>
<p>The problem is that it's all still too floaty and insubstantial, lacking that audio/visual kick that's fundamental to a great shooter. Melee attacks still feel like you're wafting Knifey in front of you rather than slicing your enemy's throat. Juggling enemies with the glob shot is still clumsy and of questionable tactical advantage, while Assault Ralph's sonorous voice is not matched by the pathetic pew of his projectiles.</p>

<figcaption>ConCon is High on Life 2 at its best, while the ringworld hub of Arcadia is shockingly pretty, but the game doesn't make a whole lot of use of it. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultimately, when your shotgun fizzles rather than booms, you've got problems, no matter how meticulously animated its face is. Indeed, much as I enjoy the skateboard's presence, it ultimately serves to distract you from the problems with High on Life 2's combat rather than actually solving them. Sure, being able to launch my skateboard into an opponent's teeth is a fun mechanical flourish. Would I swap this for a shotgun that rattles your soul when you pull the trigger? Without hesitation.</p><p>There are other lingering issues too. The music is still hideous; a tuneless electronic wail that's less an earworm and more an ear infection. The voice acting remains a mix of genuinely excellent performances and oddly flat delivery. There's still an inexplicably huge open-hub area that gives you little impetus to explore it, and I can't help but feel those resources would be better spent on one or two more high-concept missions.</p>

<div>



<p>1: There truly is a Con for everything. 2: Do you like random jumpscares with your disappointing restaurant  food? 3: You can't call High on Life 2 plain.</p>

</div>


<p>Finally, the version of High on Life 2 I played suffered from several major bugs. The most notable of these prevented me from talking to key characters outside of cutscenes, essentially skipping all of their dialogue. This didn’t seem like it would be too much of a problem until I found myself having to solve a murder in the game's first act, wherein said bug prevented me from interrogating any of the suspects. As it happens, I still managed to correctly identify the killer, so just call me Lieutenant Sherlock Poirot from now on.</p>
<p>Regardless, I came away from High on Life 2 pleasantly surprised. Not mesmerised. Not blown away. But also not wishing I could charge Justin Roiland for 15 of the sorriest hours of my life. I won't speculate on how Roiland's departure from Squanch affected the trajectory of the sequel. But from an outside perspective, High on Life 2 has grown up in mostly the right ways, while retaining enough of its goofball personality to be a good hang when it counts. Is it love? Not quite. But I wouldn't kick it out of bed either.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Fallout Season 2</a> and the imminent arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port have led to a plethora of news on the past, present, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">future</a> of the franchise. Of course, that includes plenty of new insights on the development of the more distant games, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartII">Game Informer's multi-part Oral History</a> of the enduring RPG series is the gift that keeps on giving (really, give it a full read if you have the time), and now we're sharing an interesting bit on what actually happened with Fallout 3's Washington DC area, which we've always known <a href="https://archive.ph/2JtWq">was severely cut down in the final release</a> as Bethesda Games Studios readjusted the scope and depth of the ambitious game.</p>
<p>It was lead designer and writer Emil Pagliarulo, a well-known name for Bethesda fans and detractors, who commented again on the problems the team ran into as they bit more than they could chew: "Originally, we had this thought that the Metro would be connected completely underground. And we realized it was just too sprawling. It was too big."</p>
<p>If you're familiar with Fallout 3, you know that, at least in your first playthrough, moving through DC's Metro underground is pretty much unavoidable in order to advance the main questline early on. Of course, it's not a must once you figure out how things are structured and the absurd number of quests you can straight-up skip, but the ghoul-infested stations are places we've all visited at least once or twice. The problem? They're too samey and quite limited in variety. Plus, they're simply full of load screens as you transition between cells and into the topside areas of Washington.</p><p>Overall, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/if-a-fallout-3-remaster-is-happening-im-hoping-it-fixes-the-rpgs-biggest-level-design-issue/">Fallout 3's Metro map was never very enjoyable to traverse or loot</a> because of its disjointed nature, which ironically happened as a result of having to "cut down sections" because "traversing miles of underground subway stations" is all realism, but the lesson BGS has learned over the years is "that being realistic sometimes isn't fun."</p>
<p>Needless to say, there's a huge crowd for denser experiences like that, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36101">some great mods</a> for Bethesda's games have proven, but when you're targeting a mainstream audience, it just makes sense to hold back a bit and put your resources elsewhere. At least that's what I think as a renowned Bethesda sicko who'd no doubt enjoy an expanded Metro underground.</p>
<p>In any case, thinking about the more casual crowd and empowering other aspects of the RPGs clearly paid off, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-developers-talk-fallout-4-success-and-legacy">Fallout 4 instantly became Bethesda's biggest Fallout ever</a> and remains many players' personal favourite over a decade after its launch.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>
<p>You can check out Jaffe's increasingly - erm - impassioned speech in full below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

<p>The reveal trailer is self-explanatory: Sam Fisher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> series) and Solid Snake in the same game? Working together? Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>

            <p>So, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">looking impressive</a> so far, and we've also been told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">it's a pretty long game</a> even if you aren't planning on sticking around after the credits roll. With so much to do and a multiplayer option that's promising one of the most relaxing experiences of the year, how do its online functionalities work exactly?</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's big interview</a> with key Pokémon, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo figures (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mexpgsz4t22m">Kano on Bluesky</a>), we've found out about another bit of info that should please everyone who was already looking forward to the game, especially those who spent way too much time playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> with friends on private servers back in the day.</p>
<p>Before getting into how the multiplayer actually works in Pokopia, game director Takuto Edagawa revealed the project is Omega Force's largest to date: "I can't give you a specific number of people, but this is the largest number of people involved in any title developed by ω-Force (Omega Force)* to date." Moreover, creative work on the game wasn't one-sided with Game Freak and The Pokémon Company only approving submissions; new Pokémon designs were created and iterated on together all the way through.</p>
<p>About multiplayer, Edagawa says it indeed works as explained in the trailer released so far: You can either visit a host's main island or develop a "blank" one that's completely separate from the story mode progress. That second one allows players to "work together" in order to fully develop and reshape it into the peaceful village of their dreams.</p><p>The important bit here is that "even if the host (island owner) isn't playing, everyone can join in and play." The team is calling this system "Cloud Island" and it essentially works like you were thinking: Minecraft's private, persistent servers. This potentially means it's the sort of online feature that will one day go offline, but it opens up many possibilities and should make Pokémon Pokopia immensely more attractive for those of us whose schedules rarely line up. In fact, Edagawa basically states <em>that</em> was the driving force behind the functionality.</p>
<p>With only a little over two weeks to go, Pokopia is looking like one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s strongest exclusives yet, and I'm personally thinking it's going to be among 2026's biggest hits. Are you excited by the news on how multiplayer works or are you going full solo?</p>

            <p>If learning that the next entry into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> series was going multiplatform had you worried about the graphical quality of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s upcoming narrative rollercoaster, a recent interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi should put those fears to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">Speaking to Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi reassured fans concerned about the graphical quality of FF7 Remake, when asked whether recent ports to the Xbox Series S or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> had any impact on development.</p>
<p>"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with. ...I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it (laughs). "</p>
<p>Later in the interview Hamaguchi explained that due to the gradual explosion of PC popularity in Japan, and the faster rate of PC adoption in the West, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is being built with PCs in mind, reducing the quality of assets for medium-end platforms like the PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, then lower still for other platforms.</p><p>"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi  explained. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p>
<p>"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third installment. As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first. "</p>
<p>As of March last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">the Final Fantasy series had sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>, while the Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Its sequel, as well as Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations according to Square Enix</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A console release for Steam's cat-breeding roguelike Mewgenics is currently in the works.</p>
<p>That's coming from none other than Mewgenics' co-creator Edmund McMillen, who over the weekend responded to a question on social media about when players can expect a console release of the indie hit.</p>
<p>Alas, while McMillen and his fellow co-creator Tyler Glaiel are working on this console version "now", it isn't clear when it will be released. "Not sure when it will be done," <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">McMillen said</a>.</p>
<p>On the plus side, though, it sounds like everyone regardless of console preference could get a bite of the Mewgenics pie, as McMillen added "at this point it might be in Dev for all systems". Personally, I can picture losing more than a few hours to Mewgenics while curled up in bed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent post, McMillen again affirmed a console version is on the cards, and that <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?s=20">there is DLC coming</a>. It doesn't sound like this DLC will be free, though, with the <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023171863946613160?s=20">developer stating</a> "it's going to take a lot of work/people".</p>
<p>As for that DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">McMillen has said the Mewgenics team will start work on DLC "in a few months"</a>, only after seeing exactly what it is fans actually like about the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, McMillen was not expecting Mewgenics to become the hit that it has. As a reminder, the game sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and last week developer Glaiel revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in just 36 hours. That's not too shabby at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> are sitting at a "Very Positive" average, with comments such as "McMillen you did it again I want to punch you". There is also a lot of love for Mewgenics' soundtrack, which has been described as both "amazing" and "bonkers".</p>

<p>The lovely Christian Donlan has already been hands-on with Mewgenics, and all in all was quite taken with it. "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Eurogamer's Mewgenics Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

<p>"What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity," said Jason Blum, Blumhouse's founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."</p>
<p>Behaviour seem similarly happy with the writers, too.</p>
<p>"Alexandre and David are two modern masters of horror, and their script celebrates a dark distinction, Dead by Daylight is a game, its world is a nightmare," added Stephen Mulrooney, producer and Behaviour's chief product officer.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with a director who appreciates the depth of their story, and cannot wait to see their visceral vision brought to life."</p>
<p>We found out that Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-is-turning-dead-by-daylight-into-a-movie">plans to adapt Dead by Daylight into a film back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game's "incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation".</p><p>Dead by Daylight launched its asymmetrical multiplayer horror - which sees four survivors attempting to escape a powerful killer - back in 2016, and the game's been played by over 50 million people since then and features some of cinema's most iconic horror villains, including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, Saw's Amanda Young, and Scream's Ghost Face.</p>

            <p>Hideki Sato, the designer of most Sega home consoles, has allegedly died.</p>
<p>As announced by Sega history zine Beep21, Sato – known as the "father of Sega hardware" – reportedly died on Thursday, 13th February. He was in his late seventies (some sources put <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allcityslopshop.com/post/3met6tgjqg22b">him at 77</a>, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Hideki_Sato">others 75</a>).</p>
<p>"Known as the Father of Sega Hardware, Mr. Hideki Sato passed away yesterday," Beep21 announced, as translated via machine. "He was truly a great figure who shaped Japanese gaming history and captivated Sega fans all around the world.</p>
<p>"The excitement and pioneering spirit of that era will remain forever in the hearts and memories of countless fans, for all eternity. Rest in peace."</p> <div>

<p>Sato joined Sega in 1971, led the research and development department in the early 1990s, and served briefly as president at Sega in the early 2000s. He and his team developed most of its hardware systems from the SG-1000 to the Dreamcast, including its arcade machines, until he left the company in 2008.</p><p>"[Our home consoles] sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes, thinking we might sell half a million!" Sato said, recounting his time at Sega with <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a>, and archived at <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">shmplations</a>. "It was a scale completely incomparable with our arcade board sales. And that is how our entire company caught Console Fever, and threw ourselves into that side of game development.</p>
<p>"We had a feeling that before long, consumers would be appreciating video games with the same sense with which they enjoyed music; moreover, since the Megadrive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player," he added. "So we painted the body black and put the '16BIT' lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console."</p> <div>

            <p>TT Games has revised its PC specs for Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight downward after initially recommending at least 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>In January, TT revealed that players hoping to join the Caped Crusader on PC would require a "recommended" spec of 32GB of RAM and 16GB as a bare minimum.</p>

<p>By comparison, <a href="https://x.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217">as pointed out by numerous unhappy players</a>, 2022's Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga demanded only 8GB RAM – and that's for recommended, too, not just as a minimum.</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">statement</a> posted to Steam, the team now says: "As part of our ongoing testing for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight on PC, we have revised our recommended hardware specifications from 32 GB RAM down to 16 GB RAM" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-pc-ram-requirement/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>To be clear, 16GB RAM is still a hefty ask for some, especially given the well-documented difficulties and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/memory/more-ram-misery-the-bad-news-keeps-coming-as-analyst-firm-warns-of-an-unprecedented-and-record-breaking-surge-with-price-hikes">"unprecedented record-breaking surge"</a> that has seen RAM prices nearly double in the first six weeks of 2026 compared to the last quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>It did, however, ask us to "please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final", but did promise to keep "continuing to optimise and make improvements as we move closer to launch", which means that recommendation could still scale up or down, depending upon that optimisation work.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>Here's the full specs as they currently stand at the time of writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>	Minimum:</strong>
<ul> <li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li>OS: Windows 11</li>

            <p>A playable demo for adventure brawler Scott Pilgrim EX is now available.</p>
<p>Currently only available on Steam, you'll be able to take a virtual mid-winter trip to Toronto and sample the brand-new storyline co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games, as well as all-new music from Scott Pilgrim alumni, Anamanaguchi.</p>

<p>It's unclear if progress carries over, but I have reached out to Tribute for confirmation.</p>
<p>"Jump into Scott Pilgrim’s wonderfully weird version of Toronto and play through the first two quests of Scott Pilgrim EX either solo or with friends," Tribute Games teases. "Play as iconic heroes and exes from throughout the Scott Pilgrim franchise - with the demo sporting Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Lucas Lee, and Roxy Richter from the full game’s seven character playable roster - as you bash the robots, demons and vegans that stand in your way. Each character has their own feel and moveset, so don’t limit yourself to just one playthrough."</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. The new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots". Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city.</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim EX will initially release as a digital-only game on 3rd March for Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PS4/5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s countdown to Valentine's Day has ended, and despite all those rose references, it's not a Rule of Rose revival, but is, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> 3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-rose-teaser-countdown">While the website had spurred all kinds of theories</a> – for instance, taking the capital letters from the word salad on the site "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd" is an anagram of "Cronos", leading some to speculate that this was a teaser for DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> – Bloober has marked the tenth anniversary of the horror game with confirmation of a third instalment.</p>

<p>There was no gameplay to showcase, I'm afraid, but we were treated to a strange live-action teaser, embedded above, in which we were told "the door won't stay closed". Unfortunately, there's no other information, either, such as a release date.</p>
<p>Though entitled Layers of Fear 3, this is actually the fourth Layers of Fear game, as the original game was remade for current-gen systems in 2023.</p><figure>

<p>Bloober's been on a good run. It's already released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of Layers of Fear called Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition, and is also working on Silent Hill 1 Remake and Project M, a horror game published by Broken Mirror Games exclusively on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>While I loved the settings and imagery, I ultimately didn't get on with the previous sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear-2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, labelling it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-2-eagerly-anticipated-horror-sequel-falls-flat">a slick psychological horror plagued by poor pacing and infuriating instakills</a> when I reviewed it back in 2019. I similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blair-witch-review-lumpy-horror-that-has-its-fair-share-of-scares">struggled with Blair Witch</a>, and though I enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-medium-review">The Medium's aesthetics and mysterious storyline</a>, its finale contains some, uh, troubling narrative choices. I have, however, very much enjoyed the team's later output, including Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">which received a rare 5/5 from me,</a> and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

            <p>UK Discord users have raised concerns about the company's new age verification processes, claiming that while it had originally promised that "video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device", a change in service provider allegedly now suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Discord announced its new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">revealing that age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe</a> in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content." Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features.</p>
<p>Building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK, without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands, speak on Discord server stages, or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know.</p>
<p>Originally, Discord said that video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" – "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Discord's FAQ | <span>Image credit: <cite>Discord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, however, users in the UK have noted that Discord's FAQ advises British users that they <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">"may be part of an experiment"</a> where your information will be processed by age-assurance vendor, Persona. Instead of your selfie "never leaving your device", the information you submit will now "be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted". It does, however, insist that "all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used".</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PC Gamer</a> posits, we're not entirely sure why Discord deviated from its initial plan, but suggested it may be due to the fact that users have worked out how to cheese its other age verification partner, k-ID. But while explicit assurances are given that Discord and k-ID "do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device," no such assurances can be given to users funnelled into the Persona "experiment".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Discord's FAQ | <span>Image credit: <cite>Discord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That's not all, though; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r49346/oh_good_discords_age_verification_rollout_has/">some users are also unhappy</a> not just with the age verification process itself and the security of their data, but also the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">people bankrolling Persona</a>, which includes the investment fund of Palantir founder, Peter Thiel. Palantir is the data and surveillance company currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>, and Thiel's name appears 2000+ times <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html">in the Epstein files</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Discord for comment.</p>
<p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-customer-service-system-breached-by-authorised-party-gaining-access-to-a-small-number-of-government-id-images">a third-party customer service system used by Discord's support teams was hacked</a>, compromising some user personal data, including government IDs.</p>

<p>"We can confirm that we're taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be. This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio's co-founders," the studio stated.</p>
<p>"We recognise these changes are difficult, and we're approaching them thoughtfully. Out of respect for everyone involved, we won't comment on individual situations.</p>
<p>"We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we'll do it through our official channels."</p>
<p>It's unclear which, if any, of the team's original nine-member team remain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-gameplay-trailer-pc-gaming-show">We last had an update on Den of Wolves back in December</a>. A teaser showcased a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad.</p>

            <p>Valve is testing the ability to permit Steam reviewers to include hardware specs in their reviews.</p>
<p>Though only available to participants in Steam's Client Beta for now, reviewers will be able to "attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page".</p>
<p>If it rolls out to all, it'll help players identify if any performance issues are restricted to certain specs or configurations, and if anyone else with a similar rig is having the same problems.</p>
<p>The patch also fixes an issue wherein streaming could throttle downloads even after you've finished streaming, and adds the option to provide anonymised framerate data.</p>
<p>"When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve explains in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">beta client patch notes</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-reviews-set-to-show-a-players-specs-so-its-easier-to-know-if-youll-share-their-experience-or-they-misread-the-minimum/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS."</p>
<p>Here's the full patch note:</p>
<blockquote><p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</li>
<li>Added the option to provide anonymised framerate data. When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on. This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Families</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved setting layout and navigation on desktop, deck and mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Streaming</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where streaming could leave downloads throttled even after the stream stopped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in Proton games showing up as "Not valid on current platform" for users with very large libraries when using offline mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>When submitting feedback on whether you agree with a Deck Verified rating, if you disagree we'll now ask for the reason. Providing a reason is optional.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Talking of Steam, a couple of weeks ago, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-there-such-a-bustling-community-around-marathons-soundtrack-when-the-game-isnt-even-out-yet-one-producer-tells-us-why<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>If there's one thing that I am unapologetically a fan of when it comes to Marathon, it's the game's approach to music. An electronic tracklist is nothing new in video games, of course, but this mix of aggressive high-tempo tunes and haunting vocals had me hooked the moment I first heard a song from the game's trailers. It turns out I'm not alone.</p>
<p>Because even though the game isn't out yet - and only a small slice of the overall playlist has been released to the public - remixes are already out there and taking Marathon's ethereal aura in interesting directions. Producers are taking something good and putting their own spin on it; a good omen if ever there was one (especially for a game that’s not even out yet).</p>
<p>One such producer, who goes by Datreya online, caused my ears to perk up with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-yzMUpvZYQ&amp;list=RDu-yzMUpvZYQ&amp;start_radio=1">Timeleach remix</a>. "I think anyone who's interested in, or has briefly seen anything about Marathon, notices two things: first is the game's visual style, and second is its music," Datreya told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>The reason why Marathon, rather than other games in the zeitgeist right now, appeals to Datreya is because it has a distinct approach to score-making that the producer feels isn't really present elsewhere. He came to Marathon blind, first being introduced by the game after being invited to score a lore video for the upcoming release by other designer <a href="https://x.com/vsIvsk">Michael Veselovsky</a> and YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/JakeTheAlright">JaketheAlright</a>.</p><p>"The soundtracks that Bungie showed us are distinguished by memorable leitmotifs, which, in my opinion, are usually not that prevalent in game music overall," Datreya states. "It was these leitmotifs that inspired me to make a remix, in fact. I wanted to collect the best of the original song, preserve its vibe, and add small elements that would help to further the feelings that the original invokes, as well as adding my own twist."</p>
<p>"Preserving the track's original presentation and atmosphere was key for me. Because the original sound is what's most appealing, I was very careful when manipulating the sound. I didn't touch much of the first half, and it was essentially a rearrangement of the original. Then came various small touches where I wanted to speed things up a bit and add something new without overpowering the original motifs, including some synth pads and leads.</p>

<p>"Approaching the second half, I wanted to add something unexpected, something completely new, while still staying true to the theme. As I approached the turning point in the track, I started playing with the rhythm, distorting it slightly and the track became more glitchy, which increased the intensity. Then there's the drop itself: heavy, bassy, immersive. Something that I felt was missing and something you don't expect to hear."</p><p>It's worth noting that the Marathon community has been incredibly appreciative of such works like Datreya's Timeleach remix, spurring him on to continue future projects around the game. "This game and its community have given me a lot as a musician. It's also opened up new avenues for my musical development and I really enjoy working in this direction. So yes, I think you'll hear a lot more of my work inspired by this game."</p>
<p>The truth is that video game soundtracks, like their aesthetics or their stories, can act as viable kindling for other's own spins and iterations, spurring on a wave of creativity in the sphere surrounding the core experience.</p>
<p>Marathon, as a game, may have been good with a regular ol' sci-fi soundtrack. But taking that leap towards something bold and vastly different from other big releases coming around right now acts as a magnet for these interesting community projects. It's why I, for one, am keen to hear more.</p>
<p>Given the turbulent development Bungie has had with the game to date, it’s assuring and invigorating to see at least one part of the fledgling community seemingly take off, weeks before the final product comes to our PCs and consoles. Bungie needed a win, really, and seeing a healthy, excited community magnetised to the game’s soundtrack (something Bungie has always put significant effort into, from Halo to Destiny) shows that this studio is still capable of getting people excited when it needs to.</p>

            <h2>14th February</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, Bertie plays a classic but finds himself getting a bit bored; Marie adopts a black cat called Salem; Tom can't get out of the menus; Victoria makes a young child cry; Dom Platinums a game and feels very smug about it; and Connor finds an inventive way to play two MMOs at once.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Diablo 2 Resurrected, Switch 2</h2>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>It's a bit boring? Ever the contrarian, aren't I? But I can't hide the truth: this was how I felt when I played the game. Important clarifying statement: I haven't played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> before. I've always been keen to; it's one of the games I've had earmarked for years out of a sense of duty to perform some reverential digital pilgrimage to experience all of the classics. Plus, I'm a Diablo fan, and with a brand new warlock class added this week, there's never been a better time to try Diablo 2. But I didn't especially enjoy it.</p>
<p>I'm a bit disappointed with myself, truth be told, but if I step back a bit, I realise it's not necessarily my fault. For I have been raised on a diet of modern Diablo, which I don't think it's mean to say has more artificial flavourings in. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> was my first game in the series and that was a dramatic pivot for it. And as Diablo 2-facing as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> tries to be, it's still a fireworks display of dings and dongs and treasures and rewards, compared to the dour sparsity of Diablo 2.</p>
<p>I'll persevere; I'm sure it's a grower. I'll probably become an insufferable Diablo 2 bore by next week. But it's interesting, isn't it, the different ways that series evolve?</p>
<p><em>-Bertie</em></p>
<h2>Stardew Valley, Switch 2</h2>
<p>I needed a serious break from my battle with Cooking Mama, so this week I have found myself starting a brand new farm. I have good intentions: this time I will stick with it and not restart after a few hours. I tend to have a habit of reaching Year 3 and realising I want to start again with a different layout. But not this time! This time I have chosen the beach and I will stick with it.</p><p>So far I've raised several friendships to six hearts, stolen the Mayor's shorts, completed some museum collections, beaten Abigail at the egg hunt and adopted an all black cat called Salem. I'd say that's pretty decent progress for midway through summer in year one.</p>

<p>I think my brain might be cooked, as my 12-year-old son might say. I finally decided to play the near-universally-loved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and I spent most of the 40 minutes I had with it flicking between Performance and Quality visual settings. There's been so much chatter about the shimmering, which people seem to think is because of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>'s use of PSSR (its image scaling system) in Quality mode and the apparent overly-dim lighting in Performance mode, that I became almost paralysed, unable to commit to one mode or the other. I feel like both modes are compromised in some way (although the vastly superior frame rate in Performance is probably edging it at the moment) and I really wish there was just one that the developers decided was the best way to experience the game.</p>

<h2>The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Dobble</h2>
<p>I've always known that I am quite a competitive person, but I didn't really appreciate how competitive I was until playing The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Dobble with my neighbours and their son last week.</p>
<p>"ARAGORN!!!" I bellowed as I slammed my hand down hard onto... their son's tiny and unassuming hand. He looked at me, and I looked at him. I knew what was coming. So did he. So did his parents. We all knew what was coming. "Mum-mmmmmy," the small boy cried out, his once adoring bright eyes now filled with tears as he ran to the comfort of his mother's embrace. Whoops!</p>
<p>Still, I won the game. So, you know: worth it.</p>

<p>Allow me to boast for a second: I have Platinum'd Nioh 3. I actually think it's the easiest game in the trilogy so far. Being able to grind against bosses and enemies in the open world helps a lot,<em> a la</em> Elden Ring, sure, but I also think the ninja/samurai dichotomy really works in its favour to make you feel like an invincible killing machine when all the cylinders align just right. Don't get me wrong, there are still some skill checks that feel deeply aggravating,, and the gauntlet battle scrolls where you need to beat five bosses back to back suck. Maybe I'm just getting better at the series, or maybe Team Ninja wanted to make it a bit easier to get a bigger bite of the apple. Either way, it rules.</p>

<h2>Double MMOs, PC</h2>
<p>I've been playing a combo of Old School RuneScape and World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade - at the same time. Now, that might sound wild, but it works. Here's how. In Old School RuneScape, there is plenty you can do practically AFK. For me, it's been going for rare versions of certain fish: the big bass, swordfish, and shark. These are low-drop rate variants of common fish so you just pull up to a fishing spot, start fishing, then tab out.</p><p>In The Burning Crusade, I'm playing a Boomkin, which is basically a giant chicken who uses a lot of mana. While questing, you kill a lot of enemies right? Boars and big birds and loads of orcs. After a few mobs, the Boomkin is out-of-mana (or OOM). This is annoying in group content, like dungeons, but in questing it doesn't matter much. In fact, it provides a chunk of time when you can tab out while passively regenerating mana.</p>
<p>So you see where this is going. I'm doing some fishing in OSRS, then tabbing out to quest in WoW, then going back to OSRS when I'm OOM. Yeah it's stupid, but doing this I hit level 69 in a few days and have both the big bass and swordfish. I've also not had a match on Hinge in like three weeks so y'know, that's how it's going at the moment. Excited to run The Botanica!</p>

            <p>It's tempting to believe that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> playerbase has been eclipsed by a resurgent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected on one side, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> on the other, but according to Blizzard, that's not the case. Apparently there's still a "massive" playerbase playing Diablo 3, and it counts players in the "millions".</p>
<p>"Each game has its own core players," Diablo Legacy executive producer Matthew Cederquist told me during a group interview at Blizzard recently - Diablo 3 technically falls under the Legacy team's jurisdiction. "There's actually millions of people that still play Diablo 3.</p>
<p>"Even when Diablo 4 came out, some players were cannibalised and brought over to D4, but there's still a massive player base for Diablo 3," he added. "Every single ladder season that comes out, you will see people transition from D4 back to D3 and play for that opening weekend, or that week or so, and they'll transition right back to D4. And vice versa D2."</p>

<p>Cederquist's remark was made when I asked about a comment by previous Diablo boss Rod Fergusson - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7363590883784466434/">who left Blizzard about five months ago to join 2K and lead BioShock</a> - who <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/diablo-iv-">told GameFile</a> in March that, "We have more Diablo 2: Resurrected players than Diablo 3 right now." But that statement only reflects a fleeting state in the series playerbase, Cederquist said. The Diablo audience's playing habits are more fluid when opposed to something like, say, World of Warcraft.</p><p>"That's the cool thing about our community," Cederquist went on to say. "It's less like World of Warcraft: Classic, where that's your home, you don't move; that's mine, I don't go to retail. There's so much inter-cannibalisation." (That's the first time I've heard that phrase.)</p>
<blockquote><em>"It's less like World of Warcraft: Classic where that's your home, you don't move; that's mine, I don't go to retail. There's so much inter-cannibalisation"</em></blockquote>
<p>"The player habits are just different in a long-form progression game," added Tim Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team. He said you spend longer doing things in World of Warcraft - levelling up your character, organising groups and raids. In Diablo games ("except maybe Diablo 1, which is unique in its own right, where I would consider it to be more of a survival horror") it's different.</p>

<p>"There's not the same class-role dynamic saying hey we need a healer, we need a tank and then DPS," Vasconcellos said. "Every class is DPS. Furthermore, the social expectation isn't that we're going to commit to having to play together to progress content.</p><p>"Is it more efficient? Yes. Is it more enjoyable? We think so. You can continue on your own if you want to and the social pressure doesn't exist there, and so people are easily able to flow between one game to the next. That's more feasible in today's modern age where we have so many demands on our time, and the playerbase has also aged and they have more responsibilities to see to. I'm a Diablo dad myself. That's just the reality; I think Diablo suits those players."</p>
<p>It's an interesting take, and a surprising dig at sibling World of Warcraft, but it doesn't answer whether Diablo 2 consistently commands a larger audience than Diablo 3. So I pushed the point again.</p>
<p>"No, no - it's not necessarily like that," responded Cederquist. "Our games fluctuate wildly, and it's because you have those seasonal contents. Everyone comes back for a ladder race, and actually the way we produce them is we separate them for that to happen, so we're never going to have a D3 ladder stepping over a D2 ladder stepping over a D4 ladder. We want players to be able to say, Okay yeah, let me jump into this flavour of Diablo today, maybe this flavour of Diablo two weeks from now and so on."</p>
<p>Whatever the player numbers, I expect there's been a surge in Diablo 2 activity this week, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Diablo 2: Resurrected surprise-released a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock, which introduced a new warlock class</a> to the game - the first new class the game has had in 25 years. The game also launched on Steam and on Game Pass, which I'm sure is bound to drive up numbers. Consider that Cederquist told me in a separate article that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-may-expand-diablo-2-more-if-warlock-class-goes-well">there were already "millions" - and he emphasised the word "millions" - of people playing Diablo 2: Resurrected</a>, and I wonder how high the playerbase will go.</p>

            <p>Silence. Two crouched shapes silhouetted in the moonlight, breath held tight as something stirs. A torch beam slices through the shadows; strange grasping limbs slide into view; tension mounts, hearts pound, and then suddenly a voice cuts in, "Hang on a minute, I'm just gonna run to the loo."</p>
<p>Co-op in horror games doesn't have the greatest rep. The argument's simple - so obvious, it barely qualifies as an argument at all: horror thrives in isolation, silence is the foundation of tension, so shove a second person into the mix and even before you've both subconsciously slipped into idle chit-chat, the set-up is antithetical to sustained atmosphere.</p>
<p>Before I started writing this, I did try and think of some horror games that disprove the theory, that successfully pull co-op off, using it to enhance rather than detract from mood. In the end, though, my list was pretty small. Supermassive's run of cinematic horrors - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, its Dark Pictures Anthology - do, I think, make it work. These are explicitly designed as popcorn blockbusters; the video game equivalent of a James Wan movie where everything is ultimately in service of a good jump scare. This is horror as a communal experience; where you'll clench together, jump, and laugh together when it's over. And, of course, it's fun making decisions together and seeing how you fail or succeed as a team. Here, not much is lost to co-op, I reckon, and everything is gained. And I think co-op works for something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> too, where the safety of companionship is the starting point, and it's then deliberately exploited, introducing contrasting isolation and separation to build fear.</p>

</div><figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Reanimal review in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGrZL3Bb0DE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As to <em>why</em> I've been pondering all this, that'll be Reanimal; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> developer Tarsier Studios' latest foray into horror - which, if you haven't read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reanimal-review">my four star review</a>, is a damn good time. It's the tale of two young protagonists lost in a bleak, violent hellscape at once eerily familiar and thoroughly unknown. It's also wonderfully, darkly atmospheric, its masterful artistry creating a thoroughly enveloping mood. That's playing solo though, and after reaching the credits, I was curious how things might change with a friend in tow. If co-op really is a mood killer, and Reanimal's most obvious asset is its ambience - how would it fare in two-player? Would it still work? Would it be its undoing? Might it even be improved?</p><p>Regardless, it's immediately evident that Tarsier's thought carefully about co-op here. It's baked right into the heart of the experience, and it's rare that more than a few minutes are allowed to go by without our two protagonists - Boy and Girl - interacting in some way. In solo (still a great way to play), the inclusion of an AI-controlled second character and a bit of streamlining means it's probably not something you'll find yourself thinking about too much, but two-player co-op brings a different sort of texture, a little more friction, to proceedings.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is Reanimal's crescendo chase sequences. Unsurprisingly, two players attempting to orchestrate their escape in real-time is far more likely to end in disaster than just one. But more interesting is the way Tarsier constantly plays around with the rhythm of co-op. Some interactions are so intuitive they barely require thought at all; you might reach an obvious impasse, for instance - a ledge requiring a leg-up, maybe - and you'll both instinctively hit the corresponding buttons, no discussion required. Other times, coordination and communication are more crucial - when you're cranking a handcar, say, or turning a valve. It feels like an attempt not just to inject some variety, but to introduce a flow that doesn't ride roughshod over the atmosphere by constantly forcing players into conversation.</p>



<p>I'm not going to claim Reanimal doesn't lose some of its ambience in the constant companionship of co-op, mind. It's definitely, perhaps inevitably, one to play solo if you want the full uninterrupted force of its insidiously creeping menace. But even so, I think Tarsier's found a space where co-op feels additive. It helps that Renanimal isn't really interested in traditional scares; jolts and jumps are minimal, and there's no intricate escalation of tension that might be undermined if your attention is suddenly pulled elsewhere. And it helps, too, that there's just the barest wisp of story to focus on. But more than that, co-op feels like it gets to the heart of Reanimal, its tale of two doomed siblings lost in something like hell. What better way to reinforce that narrative bond - that one tiny sliver of hope and humanity - what better way to accentuate its emotional core, than by piggybacking on players' real-life connections, allowing them to face hell together with a lover, a family member, or a friend?</p><p>I don't want to oversell it, though. There's nothing revolutionary, or even especially remarkable about Reanimal's co-op. But the couple of hours I've revisited, this time in two-player mode, have been an unexpectedly good time. We've "oooh"ed together as Tarsier's gorgeously cinematic camera swings for another big reveal; we've "oh no"ed together as the studio sets up its next big set-piece; we've laughed in the ensuing chaos. And more than that, we've shared a bond - two small things fighting together, thinking together, hunting for secrets together, helping each other - in a dark, unforgiving world.</p>
<p>All of which is me saying co-op is an enjoyably different way to experience Renanimal's impressive artistry, even if it does mean the intensity of the mood is inevitably dialled down. And with split-screen couch-play and online co-op supported - even a friend pass so you only need to buy one copy to rope in a pal - it's clear this isn't a facet of Reanimal Tarsier is trying to hide away. Just don't be the mood killer - pee first, play later. That's the golden rule.</p>

<p>Nioh 3 has proved popular since its debut. On its first weekend in the wild, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-reaches-almost-90000-concurrent-players-on-pc-after-launch-over-doubling-series-record">game welcomed just shy of 90,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. As our Connor reported at the time, this was <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>.</p><p>"It feels as though the series, after three iterations, has finally refined its formula to the point of excellence: like the shogun it so reveres, it has taken the roots of what has come before, paid homage to its legacy, and deigned to build something even more powerful - something even more enduring - on those foundations," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Dom wrote in Eurogamer's Nioh 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the brutality, revel in the power fantasy, and let yourself be hammered into the ground by the blunt-force trauma of a world dedicated to seeing everything in terms of absolutes."</p>

            <p>The Project Windless team isn't using gen-AI for "content creation or narrative elements", Krafton has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last night, Krafton announced Project Windless, an open-world PlayStation 5 game based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as The Bird That Drinks Tears.</p>
<p>Soon after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">trailer debuted at last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, many began to wonder if generative AI had been used during development. So, I decided to go to the source and find out, and while the Project Windless team has used AI "internally during exploratory phases" for efficiency's sake, it is not "a central, player-facing feature" of the upcoming game.</p>
<p>"Krafton's studios operate with a high degree of creative independence, enabling each team to select the tools and methods that best suit their projects," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>"For Project Windless, the Montreal team is taking a traditional, craftsmanship-driven approach to single-player development. The team primarily uses AI internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency rather than as a central, player-facing feature of the game. </p>
<p>"Project Windless uses traditional game AI systems to drive NPC behaviour and bring the world and its characters to life beyond combat. These systems govern how characters react, move, and behave in the environment. We are not using generative AI for content creation or narrative elements."</p>
<p>So, there you have it. </p>

<p>You of course don't need me to tell you how much of a hot topic AI is these days, and many studios have said they use the technology during development. Most prominently in recent months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian came under fire when founder Swen Vincke suggested the Divinity team was using gen-AI to develop concept art</a>.</p>
<p>Following backlash to this statement, Vincke said "to ensure there is no room for doubt", Larian had decided to "refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development" for its upcoming game.</p>
<p>"That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Vincke said in January</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A former Wildlight developer has shared their thoughts on Highguard's release after its announcement at The Game Awards last year, stating due to "false assumptions" around its debut trailer, "we were turned into a joke".</p>
<p>Highguard closed out The Game Awards 2025, with a trailer introducing us all to a world of battling Wardens and their magical mounts. The game then launched in January, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">quickly had a large influx of players on its release</a>. However, there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this effort to regain favour, though, yesterday it was announced that multiple Wildlight developers had been laid off, only a matter of weeks since Highguard made its free-to-play debut. But according to Highguard's former lead technical artist Josh Sobel, the team was doomed from its announcement, and it was "all downhill" after the game's reveal at the The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2022003361059631301">lengthy post on social media</a>, Sobel said internal feedback on Highguard prior to its reveal "was quite positive", and the team felt confident it had a hit on its hands. Where feedback was negative, Sobel said, "it was constructive, and often actionable". He added those "who played the game, including us, had a blast. And since we were an independent, self-published studio built with royalties in mind, many of us were hoping this could finally be the thing that broke the millennial financial curse".</p><p>But that positivity left after its The Game Awards trailer. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they've got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not," Sobel said. "The hate started immediately."</p>
<p>Sobel soon locked his X profile after Highguard's trailer, stating videos were then made about his "cowardice", with people laughing at him for "being proud" of Highguard. "All of this was very emotionally taxing," he said.</p>
<p>"There is much constructive criticism that can be and has been said about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but I don’t think it’s my place to commentate on that. I also don't think there’s any way to know whether the launch would have fared better or worse without the massive spotlight that was thrown onto us in response to The Game Awards' trailer placement. But we never got that chance," Sobel continued.</p>

<p>"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact. Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3 died for this'. At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial."</p><p>Sobel remarked that in online discussions about games like Highguard, Concord and 2XKO, people tend to say developers blame their failures on the gamers. However, Sobel says that is a "silly" notion, as gamers still have the power to inform discourse.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role," Sobel said. "All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p>
<p>There is no denying the sting and hurt in Sobel words, but while he may sound bitter about how things have ultimately panned out, it is undeniably a shame to see a game stumble out of the starting gate. To be clear, Highguard itself has not been shut down, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">with a "core group" of developers still working on it</a>. For how much longer, who can say. But whatever the end result, it is never nice to see a game 'fail', and hear about layoffs across the industry.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for Sobel, he said that "even though this adventure has come to an abrupt and emotionally challenging close" for him, he doesn't "regret one second of it".</p>
<p>Following its rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry also voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating:</p>
<p>"No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Yesterday was a big day for new video game trailers, courtesy of the Sony State of Play. But a little earlier, away from the limelight, came another lengthy showcase of an especially cool looking game you might have missed.</p>
<p>Screamer, the story-driven arcade racing game, released its career walkthrough gameplay trailer, showcasing roughly 34 minutes of cinematics, racing, and early narrative. This game has JRPG-inspired storytelling, and an opening intro cutscene paired with music from Jpop group WAGAMAMARAKIA. It's just a tease of the full game, but even so it shows some promise I reckon.</p>
<p>This trailer also highlights a variety of different racing teams, all entering the Screamer tournament. With a billion dollars on the line, drift-heavy futuristic racing lies at the heart of this underdog release. You can check out the full trailer yourself below if you fancy.</p>

<p>First revealed in 2024 and recently popping up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">at The Game Awards </a>too, Screamer is a reboot of an old MS-DOS game from all the way back in 1995. This new iteration comes from the same hands at Milestone, albeit with a healthy amount of experience since then. If that developer sounds familiar, it's the same company behind games like MotoGP 25 and Hot Wheels Unleashed: Supercharged.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to launch this year, on the 26th March on PC and consoles. If you're a racing fan, or love a bit of genre-blending in your games, maybe it's one worth keeping an eye on?</p>

            <p>Last night, we got a flurry of PlayStation-flavoured announcements thanks to the most recent State of Play. From the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">gun-fu of Jon Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">the hench chicken man in Project Windless</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">the serene colour palette of Neva: Prologue</a>, it was a pretty stacked show.</p>
<p>But, something you may have missed, is that when the next title from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House makes its debut later this year, it will be available on PS Plus (the Essential tier) from day one. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Big Walk, as the studio's upcoming game is called, is a cooperative multiplayer adventure all about teamwork and talking.</p>
<p>"Set out with your friends through a wide-open world full of challenges, puzzles, and discoveries. You'll need to work together to find your way around, stay in contact using an assortment of tools and toys, and figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless," reads the official blurb.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>House House</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Away from these adventures, there will still be time "to just hang out" with your friends. Hanging out can include watching the sunset, or if that sounds too serene, you could instead "steal your friend's binoculars and kick them into the ocean". I mean, sure, why not. In the words of House House, "spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk".</p>
<p>You can check out Big Walk's PS5 trailer below. On its release later this year (exact date TBC), Big Walk will also be coming to PC.</p>

            <p>Sony has lifted the lid on its PS Plus Premium and Extra game offerings for February.</p>
<p>Some of these games leaked ahead of schedule, but there are still more than a few surprises joining the service later this month.</p>
<p>The following games will be available for Premium and Extra PS Plus members from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | PS5</li>
<li>Neva | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Season: A Letter to the Future | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin | PS4</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Stories | PS4</li>
<li>Venba | PS5</li>

</ul>
<p>PlayStation Plus Premium members will also be able to play the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disney Pixar Wall-E | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>During last night's PlayStation State of Play, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">Nomada actually announced a prequel game known as Neva: Prologue</a>, which takes us back to when Alba meets her young wolf companion. So, having Neva on PS Plus is a very timely addition (it is almost like Sony and co also thought this).</p>
<p>Also, a quick shout out for Venba, a cooking game which also delves into the emotional impact of food and family. We called the game a "beautiful slice-of-life tale" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's four star Venba review</a>.</p>

            <p>If you watched last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony State of Play</a> and were especially hyped over Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, there's some really good news for you tucked away on <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">the official Castlevania website</a>.</p>
<p>This news is that Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is just the beginning of new Castlevania "products". In a message released as part of the series' 40th anniversary, the Castlevania series production team teased what the future holds.</p>
<p>"The doors of Castlevania open once more," the statement reads. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original 'Akumajō Dracula' first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, "Castlevania" will be revived."</p>
<p>Coming first is Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, as announced at the State of Play. Konami says that the development studios working on the game, Evil Empire and Motion Twin, are "brimming with talent and passion.". Konami hopes they will "deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation."</p><p>Now the key bit for fans hoping for a big revival of the series: "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent "nightmare" lurking in the darkness," reads the statement. While not explicitly saying new games (Castlevania has already had comics and TV series), you've got to assume more games will be part of this future.</p>
<p>That's all we have for now, but it's certainly an exciting development in a Konami series that has been largely absent for many years now. Whether these new games will stay classic in genre like Belmont's Curse, or if we'll see a new 3rd person action game like the Lords of Shadow series (yes please) remains a mystery. One can dream!</p>
<p>If you like the look of Belmont's Curse, it's available to wishlist now with a 2026 release date.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 10AM GMT:</strong> There's a Project Windless developer diary video which offers an extended look at the game, and at some making-of footage of the game. There's not much more information in it, but the reference is to the main character being the Hero King, who is presumably the main character of the book series The Bird That Drinks Tears. This is their origin story, set 1500 years before the events of those books.</p>

<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 1AM GMT:</strong> What a terrible day to be a God of War-like! You put on your fanciest bird suit for your big reveal, then a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">whole bunch of actual God of Wars come along</a> and steal your thunder. But that's not to say Krafton's new open-world PlayStation 5 game Project Windless isn't intriguing.
</p>
<p>
Project Windless is, for starters, based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as The Bird That Drinks Tears. Four books have been released so far, all set in a world inhabited by four main races: the boring old humans, the reptilian Nhaga, the Tokkebi, and the bird-like Rekon. That's how we get Project Windless' perhaps somewhat unlikely looking protagonist.

<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/announcing-open-world-action-rpg-project-windless-for-ps5/">per the PlayStation Blog</a>, Project Windless (which is being led by Patrik Méthé, veteran director on Ubisoft's Far Cry series) takes place over a thousand years before the events of the books, and focuses its attention on the Rekon. We haven't been given the name of its musclebound bird protagonist yet, but Krafton says the Rekon's "speed, reach, and physical presence" were the perfect fit for the "one-versus-many combat fantasy" at the Windless' core.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, its open world is designed with "as little hand-holding as possible" in order to stoke curiosity, and to encourage players "to take risks, to forge alliances, to wage war, and ultimately to decide what kind of legend [they] want to become." As for combat, there are echoes of Dynasty Warriors, as players are battle "dozens (sometimes hundreds) of enemies at once."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all we know so far. Project Windless is currently in development for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> (no other platforms are confirmed) and doesn't have even a whiff of a release date.

            <p>Ready your swords, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>'s online co-op multiplayer - known as Legends - is set to arrive in a little under a month.</p>
<p>As announced at this evening's PlayStation State of Play, Legends will be available from 10th March, thanks to a free update for all Ghost of Yōtei owners. You can check out its release date trailer below:</p>

<p>As for the specifics, developer Sucker Punch has said Legends will arrive with three mission types.</p>
<p>"In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps," it explained, adding players will have to "fight to control territory" on each map.</p>
<p>"While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage." The Legends team noted that each map "will have its own unique Curses and Blessings" for players to experience.</p><p>In Story, meanwhile, players will be able to join forces with another and then tackle a series of 12 missions. "After completing each set of three Story missions, you'll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six," Sucker Punch said. "Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</p>
<p>"As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we'll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sucker Punch</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then we have the classes players can play as in Ghost of Yōtei Legends. These are Samurai, Archer, Mercenary, or Shinobi. Any class can use a ranged weapon in addition to a katana, but of course each will have their own unique strengths.</p><p>If you play as a Samurai, for example, you will be able to wield the ōdachi. The Samirai also has access to the widest range of weapon types. If you opt to play as an Archer, then you will be able to use the yari (that's a spear), as well as carry an additional ranged weapon. Mercenaries, meanwhile, get the dual katana "with a variety of utility-focused abilities". Last but not least, we have the Shinobi who can use the kusarigama, "as well as a suite of stealth-focused skills".</p>
<p>Closing out its reveal, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/ghost-of-yotei-legends-comes-to-ps5-on-march-10/">Sucker Punch's senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb said</a>: "The fan response to Legends was one of the most rewarding parts of launching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and we're so excited to see the mode return for Ghost of Yōtei; we can't for you all to dive in!"</p>

            <p>Game Freak has shed a little more light on the "relatively small" internal team working on its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, who along with her canine companion Koo will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that while Game Freak - which is also known for its work on the Pokémon series - is developing Beast of Reincarnation, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/only-a-relatively-small-team-from-pokemon-developer-game-freak-is-actually-working-on-beast-of-reincarnation">has enlisted the help of other studios to support its work</a>. "We're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well," the developer said in January.</p>
<p>Now, following the debut of the game's latest trailer (see further down in this article), I was able to ask game director Kota Furushima a few questions about Game Freak's upcoming release, and I enquired further into how the Beast of Reincarnation team is divided.</p><p>"The creative direction and project management are led by the staff at Game Freak," Furushima explained to Eurogamer. "However, since our internal team is relatively small, we work with trusted external partners on specific parts of the project needed to realise the concept."</p>
<p>The director added how "fortunate" Game Freak was to have the "support of several dozen reliable development partners" working on Beast of Reincarnation. "Game Freak handles the creative direction, technical problem-solving, production leadership, and overall project management to ensure everything stays on track," Furushima closed.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation is set to release on 4th August. You can read more from my chat with Furushima here: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/though-beast-of-reincarnation-is-all-about-loneliness-game-freak-doesnt-want-it-to-be-sad-enter-warmth-reliability-and-your-dog-pal">Though Beast of Reincarnation is all about "loneliness", Game Freak doesn't want it to be sad: enter "warmth", "reliability" and your dog pal</a>.</p>

            <p>Game Freak may be best known as the developer behind many a Pokémon game, but that could soon be changing with its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation places players in the shoes of Emma the Sealer, who will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity. It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan, and comes complete with gritty combat, a melancholic score and some really rather stunning imagery. All in all, it is a far cry from the more cartoony and bright battles between Pikachu and co.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, Emma will have her loyal and ever so fluffy canine companion Koo by her side in Beast of Reincarnation, as she battles her way through the hauntingly beautiful Blighted plant life and Golems standing in her way.</p>

<p>I recently got the chance to ask Beast of Reincarnation's game director Kota Furushima a few questions about Game Freak's upcoming release, which is set to debut on 4th August. Below, we chat all about just how Beast of Reincarnation came to be, its influences and, of course, the importance of man's best friend, the dog.</p>
<p><strong>Beast of Reincarnation is quite different from other games Game Freak is known for. Can you tell me more about how it all came to be, and when work on Beast of Reincarnation began?</strong></p>
<p>KF: To put it simply, this project started because I wanted to make it. I had always wanted to create a title based on my own idea, something with a unique feeling that players could only experience through this game.</p>
<p>At Game Freak, there is a system called the Gear Project that allows team members to pitch original game ideas. Around that time, a contest was being held where Satoshi Tajiri would personally review and select proposals.</p>
<p>I submitted mine, received an award, and it was chosen for prototyping. That was six years ago. At first, I worked on the prototype by myself. But as I aimed to bring the concept to life, I gradually gained support from others, and the project moved into full development.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me more about the inspirations for Beast of Reincarnation? Such as Emma's hair and the mythos of this world.</strong></p>
<p>KF: To begin with, in order to realise the core concepts of warmth, reliability, and loneliness, we started shaping the game design around a journey through a harsh and unforgiving world. As part of that process, we imagined more intense and close-range combat, which led to the decision to have the protagonist wield a sword. To allow free movement at any moment, whether swinging the sword or running, we introduced hair fused with plant life as an element the player could control independently from the character's limbs.</p><p>This world is rooted in a form of animistic belief drawn from traditional Japanese spirituality. I wanted to express the overwhelming presence of nature, especially the sense of being attacked by plants themselves. That led to the creation of an enemy that feels like a physical embodiment of the idea of a brutal world covered in vegetation. This is the powerful enemy known in the game as the Malefacts.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Game Freak</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>How has your work on the Pokémon series influenced Beast of Reincarnation? </strong></p>
<p>KF: It begins with thinking about what makes something fun in a logical way. The style I follow is to connect emotional responses that arise through the player’s experience with clear reasoning, in order to bring the concept to life.</p>
<p>For Beast of Reincarnation, we didn't start by deciding on a genre, story, or art style. Instead, we began with the question, "What kind of feeling do we want the player to have?"</p>
<p>To use a novel as an example, it's like imagining the mood while reading or the sensation you have upon finishing the book. From that feeling, we began to shape all aspects of the design. That includes game design, of course, but also the art direction, sound, story, and characters - everything was built around that initial emotional vision.</p>
<p><strong>All of your trailers have shown that the relationship between Emma and Koo is a very important one. Can you say why you chose to have an animal companion for Emma, and specifically why a dog? </strong></p>
<p>KF: To express the feeling of "loneliness" as a core concept, I felt the story needed not just one character, but two. When thinking about what the most meaningful pairing would be, there were many possible directions, but I decided that a silent animal companion would be the best fit for the kind of gameplay we wanted to create. The idea of forming a relationship with something that does not speak felt like a strong and fitting theme for a video game.</p>
<p>In this game, the player gives commands in a turn-based battle system. And when I thought about an animal that would naturally follow orders given through commands, a dog felt like the most intuitive choice.</p>
<p><strong>In the official description for Beast of Reincarnation, you ask players to "Explore what it means to be human". What do you hope players will get from this game? Do you think or hope players will learn more about themselves through playing the game? What message do you hope to convey in Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p>
<p>KF: The protagonist of this game is a girl named Emma, who has been tainted by corruption and raised in isolation, without memory or emotion. Her journey begins in a completely blank state.</p>
<p>I hope players will experience and interpret how she feels through gameplay itself. Since I want to leave that discovery in the hands of each player, I will refrain from explaining it here.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Game Freak</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>You've spoken about Beast of Reincarnation's demanding and technical combat. Can you elaborate on this at all? How will it be more demanding than other games? Are there other games you think have similar combat technicalities and demands?</strong></p>
<p>KF: This game is described as an "action RPG about one person and one animal," and that pairing is just as important in combat. Players control Emma and engage in real-time action battles. When Emma successfully performs a parry, she builds up points needed for Koo's powerful techniques, known as Bloom Arts.</p><p>During battle, pressing a specific button brings up a selection of Bloom Arts that Koo can use. These are triggered through a command-style interface, different from the split-second decisions required in real-time action. Instead, choosing a Bloom Art is a momentary pause in the flow, where the player makes a more strategic decision: What is the most effective move right now? Do you want to bind the enemy, deal heavy damage, create a jump point so Emma can escape into the air, strike a weak point, or perhaps heal or support Emma?</p>
<p>Because these skills can be activated at any time, they allow players to respond to constantly shifting battle conditions and change the tide in thoughtful ways. You can open the command menu at any time, and the flow of time slows down significantly while it is open, giving you space to think carefully and make your choice without pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any last messages you would like to share with Eurogamer's readers about Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p>
<p>KF: It's been six years since the initial concept, and the journey has been a long one. But thanks to the support and anticipation from all of you, our development team has been able to keep pushing forward. We are truly grateful.</p>
<p>The game features a unique battle system that blends real-time action with turn-based RPG mechanics, and with this design, we have created emotional moments and surprises that you can only experience in this title.</p>
<p>We cannot wait for you to step into the world we have built. We look forward to bringing the game to everyone.</p>

<p>As well as this new game, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade. This particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series’ roots that got us to where we are today," reads a post on the PlayStation blog.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we’re very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, you can enjoy this introduction from Kratos voice actor TC Carson.</p>

            <p>
After years in the video game wilderness, Silent Hill finally feels like its back on track (we'll ignore the recent movie, however), and hopes are high that its winning streak will continue as we get our first proper look at the next game in the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Townfall was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">one of three Silent Hill games to be announced by Konami</a> back in 2022. Two of those are now out - the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake and last year's superb <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> - meaning there's just one more to go. And Townfall is, in some ways, the most intriguing of the bunch, given it's being developed by Screen Burn (formerly No Code) - the small Glasgow studio behind the acclaimed Stories Untold and Observation. And, as seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvN3dP92wxU">today's new trailer</a>, Townfall appears to take place in a small British seaside town called St. Amelia.

<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/silent-hill-townfall-reveals-first-person-gameplay-in-a-new-trailer/">explained on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Silent Hill: Townfall builds its action - consisting of story-driven puzzles and combat - around a vaguely Game Boy-like device known as the CRTV. Owned by new protagonist Simon Ordell, it's intended to be a fresh (albeit heavily retro-inspired) take on the series' iconic handheld radio, featuring both audio and video.
</p><p>
Townfall unfolds in first-person, with players deploying the CRTV to pick up signals around town and reveal more of the story. It's also used to solve certain challenges - Screen Burn mentions "tactile and intricate" puzzles - and to help Simon 'see' through the environment and locate nearby threats.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
And when those threats grow unavoidable, which could be often given enemies "dynamically hunt" players, combat also occurs in first-person. Here, players can make use of melee and ranged weapons, but Screen Burn stresses the key to success is knowing when not to fight. "Using a combination of the CRTV, some environmental opportunities, and an intuitive peek system," it explains, "stealth is an equally important strategy needed to survive."
</p>
<p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto adds that Townfall is one of the "most aesthetic and sophisticated" entries in the series to date. "Players who seek a more refined experience will especially appreciate this game," he concludes, "as it offers intellectual discoveries through puzzles and analysis, while the town's atmosphere and the portrayal of the Otherworld will entertain players through its aestheticism."
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Silent Hill: Towfall yet, but wishlists are now available on PlayStation Store.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain</a> franchise might be one of the most beloved cult franchises in gaming (for Millennial goths with an English degree, like myself, at least). The dark fantasy action-adventure series kicked off with Blood Omen back in 1996, and followed that up with Soul Reaver in 1999, before a three-year run of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-soulreaver2-ps2">Soul Reaver 2</a>, Blood Omen 2, and Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/defiance">Defiance</a> rounded off the series for a <em>very </em>long time in 2003. Fast-forward 21 years, and we saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-and-2-remastered">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a> in 2024 - reigniting dormant fans everywhere and bringing the esteemed series back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Today, during PlayStation's State of Play presentation (and then in a news blast shortly after), Crystal Dynamics announced that we're getting two more releases in the LoK series - and very soon.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Something less human and more... divine. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Crystal Dynamics</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First up is Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered, which will debut on 3rd March, 2026. It launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, is developed by Crystal Dynamics and PlayEveryWare, and you get bonus skins for the two main characters (Kain and Raziel) based on the original 'Shifter' game concept if you pre-order before launch.</p><p>Per a press release: "Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered modernizes the iconic 2003 action-adventure game with new graphic upgrades, modernized controls, and extensive bonus content." Highlights of the remaster include upgrading the game to proper HD, a new camera,  upgraded character models, textures, and environments, and the ability to switch between classic and modern presentation on the fly (as was present in Soul Reaver 1 + 2 Reamastered).</p>
<p>You can opt for the original fixed camera, or a new third-person camera built for modern platforms. There is also a slew of additions including a photo mode, alternate character skins, a comprehensive lore reader, unreleased content and 'lost levels' from the original game. Again, anyone who tried out Soul Reaver 1 + 2 Remastered will know what to expect here.</p>

<p>But the other game, now <em>that</em>'<em>s</em> something wholly new. Announced just after the show - but shown to us in a presser beforehand - Legacy of Kain: Ascendance, is a "fast-paced 2D action platformer published by Crystal Dynamics and developed by Bit Bot Media in association with FreakZone Games (A Bit Bot Company) that introduces a brand-new gameplay style to the franchise, and features original voice actors reprising their iconic roles". That means we're getting Simon Templeman as Kain, Michael Bell as Raziel, Anne Gunn as Ariel and Richard Doyle as Moebius.</p><p>The project looks like quite a weird one. Per a presentation I saw with Crystal Dynamics before the State of Play, the folks at Crystal Dynamics are calling Ascendance a 'prequel', even though you will be hopping all over the Nosgoth timeline thanks to our old pal, Moebius. It's also got various art styles; 3D sections are inspired by the PS1-era appear at key narrative points, (which "offer story-driven interaction and lore-heavy sequences", per the PR), whilst other major plot points are support by anime-inspired sequences. Meanwhile the game itself is a 2D action platformer, I suppose easily related to other modern-retro franchise revivals like Shinobi: Vengeance or Ninja Gaiden Ragebound.</p>

<p>Legacy of Kain: Ascendance arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on 31st March, 2026. The jury is still out for me on this one, but I'm not going to turn my nose up at anything Legacy of Kain in the year of 2026: I'm very pleased we're getting anything at all, and Crystal Dyanmics assures me "there's more to come".</p>

            <p>Marathon is almost here, at long last. It's been a bumpy journey to get here, but the finish goal is finally in sight for Bungie. To celebrate the incoming launch, the developer has announced it will be hosting a Server Slam <strong>coming 26th February 26 and running until 2nd March</strong>. Which, for my money, is perilously close to the official release on 5th March.
</p>
<p>Per a post on the PlayStation Blog, the weekend will feature an "introduction to Marathon's gameplay, with additional maps, factions, contracts, and more to come at launch and during Season 1."
</p>
<p>Bungie also shared a first look at some special rewards for PlayStation Plus players: a trio of weapon charms paying homage to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>.
</p>
<p>These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ghost of Yōtei – Onryō Weapon Charm </li>
<li>Death Stranding 2 – Battle Guitar Weapon Charm</li>
<li>Helldivers 2 – For Freedom Weapon Charm</li>
</ul>
<p>This, of course, isn't the first time Marathon has poked its head above the proverbial parapet to see what the general public thinks of the game. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">after its first public test</a>, players were torn on certain design decisions made to the game, with a lack of solo queue or proximity chat standing out as especially jarring absences. Then, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">there was that plagiarism scandal</a>, with many of its visual assets seemingly based on an outside-artists' work.
</p><p>So it's not been an easy ride for the game, or Bungie, or Sony (who is backing the project). But changes in commuication, development process and design choice have all been enacted in the studio over the past couple of months, so maybe the final product will be something that stands out from the narrative around the game to date. We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it's highly likely that the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has built some solid foundations for an extraction shooter targetting the mainstream... but can Bungie's latest gamble eat into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">Embark's huge market share</a>? We'll find out in March.</p>

            <p>Now, there were many things I was expecting to turn up at this evening's PlayStation State of Play. A Resident Evil Requiem demo, for example (I am not annoyed we don't have one yet, you are). One thing that wasn't on my bingo card, though, was a John Wick game. But, that's exactly what we got.</p>
<p>The upcoming John Wick game is a collaboration between Saber, Lionsgate, and franchise director Chad Stahelsk. It will feature an original script set in the John Wick timeline, which will expand "on the franchise's intricate lore with familiar characters fans already know, as well as completely new ones".</p>
<p>As for combat, well you can expect "a distinct gun fu combat system". There will also be "jaw-dropping camerawork, immersive driving experiences, and a variety of memorable environments, all crafted to make players feel like they are in a John Wick movie, playing the role of John Wick himself". Yes, that does mean Keanu Reeves is signed on to reprise his iconic character's look, voice "and more". Eats, shoots and leaves? More like, Eats, shoots and Reeves!</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for the John Wick game below:</p>

            <p>It's been about seven years since we last had a meaningful udpate in the Dead or Alive franchise, but that all changed this evening when Koei Tecmo made an unexpected appearance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-live-report-a-look-ahead-at-sonys-plans">the PlayStation State of Play</a> to give us some new about the beloved fighting series.
</p>
<p>During the show, series producer Yosuke Hayashi announced that not only would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-6">Dead or Alive 6</a> get a 'Last Round' update (read: a remaster of the game that is coming to PS5), but also a brand new game in the series. I will assume this is Dead or Alive 7, but you never know: it could be a soft reboot with a brand new moniker.</p>
<p>Per the blurb for the Dead or Alive 6 Last Round trailer, this is "the definitive version of Dead or Alive 6," with loads of new features including It not only brings the game to PlayStation 5, but it also adds DLC characters to the main roster and teases further playable fighters (and costumes, of course) in future updates. A free-to-play version of the game will be available at launch, but details on how that will work - and differ from the paid version - have not been shared.

After this, a brief teaser trailer was shown, teasing "the dawn of a new chapter awaits. In development for PlayStation 5." We expect to hear more about this is due course.</p>

            <p>Rather out of the blue, Nomada Studio has announced a prequel to its beautiful puzzle-platformer Neva.</p>
<p>It's called, quite simply, Neva Prologue, and was announced at this evening's PlayStation State of Play. The upcoming prequel takes place before the events of Neva (of course), and tells the story of how Alba met her adorable wolf companion.</p>
<p>"In Neva Prologue, players follow Alba as she chases a trail of white butterflies deep into the corrupted swamps - only to discover a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone," Nomada Studio writes. "To survive, Alba must earn the cub's trust and guide them both through the blighted wetlands and the dark forces that stalk them."</p>
<p>The developer said this prequel has been designed for players to experience after completing Neva, as it offers a "deeper challenge and rich narrative" for those coming back to the game.</p>
<p>Neva Prologue "introduces three new locations, each featuring unique gameplay mechanics, alongside new enemies and intense boss encounters. Completionists will also discover five hidden challenge flowers to test their mastery".</p>
<p>Neva Prologue will be released as a standalone DLC on 19th February. You can check out its new release date trailer below.</p>

<p>"Nomada Studio follows up on the striking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's four star Neva review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Beloved limb-flinging video game mascot Rayman is 30 this year, and Ubisoft is celebrating the occasion with a special edition of his first ever adventure - and it's out on PS5 tomorrow, 13th February.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first we've heard of a Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition, of course - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-unannounced-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-popped-up-on-the-australian-ratings-board">initially surfaced earlier this year</a> in a listing on the Australian Classification Board website. Just a few weeks on, though, Ubisoft has made it official.

Developed by Digital Eclipse - the studio behind the acclaimed Gold Master Series of interactive digital museums - Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition is described as the "definitive edition" of the 1995 platform classic. It features a number of different versions of the game, including those designed for handheld, alongside 120 additional levels taken from Rayman's New Levels, Rayman 60 Levels, and Rayman by His Fans.
</p><p>
It also promises a reimagined soundtrack by composer Christophe Héral, plus a range of optional quality of life enhancements including a 60-second rewind feature, multiple save slots, instant level unlock, and infinite lives. And for a deeper dive into its creation, Digital Eclipse has included a never-before-playable prototype, original concept art, sketches, design documents, and 50 minutes of new interviews.

<p>
Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition's digital release comes to PS5 on 13th February, with a physical version due this June. An earlier leak suggested it's also Switch-bound, so I'll update this story if more platforms are confirmed. As for the future of Rayman, Ubisoft previously revealed its Montpellier and Milan teams <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">have something cooking</a>, but that we shouldn't expect news "too soon".

            <p>Game Freak has revealed a release date for its upcoming action-RPG, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>As announced at this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-live-report-a-look-ahead-at-sonys-plans">evening's PlayStation State of Play broadcast</a>, Beast of Reincarnation will arrive on 4th August, across Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5. It'll also be out on Game Pass on Xbox and PC. Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beast-of-reincarnation-gets-summer-2026-release-window-and-gameplay-breakdown-at-xbox-developer-direct">we only knew it was coming sometime this summer</a>.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan as players take the role of Emma the Sealer confronting the source of the world's corruption to save humanity. By her side, though, Emma has her loyal dog Koo, who will support her during combat.</p><p>Beast of Reincarnation all looks really rather promising, and it has been noted it looks quite different - and larger than - Game Freak's other games outside of Pokémon. The game will be published by Fictions, which was founded by a collection of game developers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere this evening, we also got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-washes-up-on-pc-in-march-less-than-a-year-since-it-arrived-on-ps5">Death Stranding 2 on PC</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unlikely-sequel-kena-scars-of-kosmora-comes-to-ps5-and-pc-in-2026">Kena Bridge of Spirits sequel</a>.</p>
